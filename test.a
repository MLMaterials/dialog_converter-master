not if we keep 'em here.  you can't kidnap somebody in their own house. it's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  or something like that, i'm pretty sure.
i want you to take this... to remember by.
*no*!
i can't get it out. it would take hours.
well -- i -- i-
you could go and open the door.
should i make it all fact?
i may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
uh, let me get back to you...
i know. he's just the best.
laurence!
condemned?  aren't i owed a trial before being condemned?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
you need six.
let us cancel the engagement.
you just come on with that three fifty and martini will take care of himself... your dice, scanlon.
i have followed my feelings.
we'd like to hire you.
cindy, i've been thinking about this whole friend thing. i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... i mean, there's ray, but he cares for me in a different way. you know, bringing me flowers. running my bath water. and then there's nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray's in my bed. holding me. and seeing that tonight might be our last night together, i was thinking...
tell her you're on your way to france and will be back in four weeks.
shook me up.  i mean that you knew her and everything --
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury, dad?
x21, give me a 20.
pedro is waiting for me, too.
your... lover?
how old are you, captain?
what is it?
colonel who?
did you have a nice christmas?
--a wiccan--
...george. i do.  my best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
you sure about this?
massive subdural hamatoma.  we have to evacuat it - right now.
where?
i told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
come in.
well good for you. i bet it works out for you.
nothing -- really.  but you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
a belgian priest by the name of father perrault, the first european to find this place, and a very great man indeed. he is responsible for everything you see here. he built shangri-la, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. in fact, shangri-la is father perrault.
twenty fucking years, man - years! i figger ten at the least.
they will if they catch him in the act. you can make that happen, dad.  you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
that makes no difference. all men are equal in god's eyes.
some are ok.
gin? where the hell are you?
no.
they'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
what?
i don't understand....
what the heck do you mean?
we have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
he came to kill us.
yeah, this place is great.
you believe that?
think we'll get him, nick?
care to indulge?
so?  what do they know?
but suppose some business comes up...
why are you being like this?
yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at kenwood.  what it is?
we will never 'evacuate', captain -- this is our home. indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
it's all right. you can write your own ticket. a hundred and fifty bucks a week.
geez. looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. you call his home?
what is it?
don’t you believe in simplicity?
and the result satisfies.
i'm a grown woman, dr. emlee.   i can take care of myself.
how much?
it's done?
jackie, can we --
i don't know.  those men killed charles to get it. but he must not have had it with him on the train.
the chairs go, the lazyboy goes...
i told you the uniform wouldn't help.
mom!!  mom!!
stay as long as you like, son.  no rush.
it's stopped?
somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, officer crow foot.
how romantic.
well, i --
yes.
anything ain't a very hard number.
sooner it you like.
well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
escort detective carter to the airport --
i suppose so.
i notice these things are back in fashion.  oh, honey.  he's a lovely man, annie.
why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
why? didn't you know him well?
surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
never heard of it.
my god damn foot is gone! who fuckin' shot me? who fuckin' shot me!?
it's more or less how it sounds. sometimes it's not pretty to watch. some horses fight it real hard. your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. so if you don't want to watch, i'll call you when it's done.
i do suppose so. but if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
yeah.
no, i'm on top of it...
oh, gosh no.
you take the test?
there's a hole! i found a square hole!
of course, you do.  being magic. then you know i've got a flu bug, and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food.  so, all the more meatballs for you.  but you know what.
thanks, talia...why are you so nice to me?
he's from southie? how many people did you try before you came to me?
do you know that it's illegal?
cut away from me?
jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?

he's just laying in bed. he's pretty upset. he won't talk.
the more things change, the more they goddamned well stay the same.

may i please see the storage facility?
even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
hurricane kept you up, too?
kicker, anything?
frances?  oh no.
we stick in each others craw.
is there more to that, or do i have to guess?
yes, i --

you know, a mookalone, a schlep.
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 1.2 hours.

you want betty grable!
vodka. straight. on the rocks.
of course it's true - and he knows it.
mommy...?
get out of here!
i don't know -- i'd like to do anything --
i think so. and if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. whatever you came up with couldn’t come close to how bad it is. bye now.
i'm sure we could find a country and western station.
he creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
can we make this quick?  roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  again.
let me kiss you.
you're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
you shot charlie pepper, didn't you? and you're the one killed william harbey an' robbed the train over...
we might lose the signal.
i'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
...you know?  i, uh...
they waved him off. he thought he knew better. he hit the ramp.
still got a sense of humour?
let's not over do it...
you were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  i was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who i am. i'm not an architect, i'm a..
do you think anyone can see us down here?
-- posed to mean?
somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
let's go.
i'm scared i'm slipping back.
you'll be better off without me. i ain't fit to live with no more. it's just like a lynchin'. maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
wit-tay.
when you get engaged?
for a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
you -- think i am -- i'm --  -- an animal.
you think i'm staying?
love.
i don't see no wedding ring, banks. conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
can you spare it?
hello.
why so glum?
what do we have, malcolm. a broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. we don't even own our own home. what about our children? what about me? you don't even own life insurance.

where is she then?
ramón -- you can't.
yes.
basic.  hmmm.
where is the ring?
miles.
laurie...
naw, honey, that would be burglary. i never got arrested for burglary. burglary's for chicken shits.  if you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  just take the money.  that's robbery.  that's a whole 'nother deal.
i'm checking out anybody who lives like desalvo.  records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  if they've got a german wife.  we can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
and i'll take that certified check, too. i've decided i can handle things around here...
but... they're odd-looking.  they're for milk.  your mum's got them.  you must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
you're looking for life?
ya know, doc, you could have folled me.
perfectly absurd.

i'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
lieutenant, i have a top secret clearance. the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you.
--like you hurt the baby--
he read the letters, nick. some day i wasn't there. he went through my room. he found your letters.
then for god's sake, don't be a detective.  stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  patrol, internal affairs, but not the bureau.
you're gonna get us hung up.
if there really is someone else in this house, i think the four of us can handle the situation.
it's a generous offer, mr. galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
what do you think?
i've just had hilda hulme on the phone.
no, no. strange, i've never seen anne act that way before.  it's funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
good luck, sir.
what is your purpose in mexico?

how do you like that? we've made twelve pictures together. his greatest successes.

i take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. she's a nutjob.
that thing, god almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
but <u>they're</u> not skipper neilsen's son!  it broke his heart.  then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - captain neilsen resigned from the navy.  oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
few minutes.  want to catch the news.

i didn't do anything. she screamed. something frightened her.
how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?
shall we unpack it?

you genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. and since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
this is terrible! this can't be happening!!
yes, of course it is.  you know you have a line here.  not a wrinkle.  actually, more of a dimple.  i've been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone.
then forget it.
i know, man.
tell your mom i said thanks.

this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  to me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
i need someone to translate for me.

you didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
okay.  i'm way over here.  is that better?

that's impossible.
hi, frank.

you can't trust those guys.
all i'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
wait a minute!  wait a minute!
i'm sorry, sir, i'm engaged to be married.  my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man.
no, miss ratched...
uh, eddie? the, um, ballistics guy, george...? he called, and...  his tests show that shu's gun fired the bullet that killed jimmy chin.
and you said there'd be some of me left.  nobody's going to know me in this getup.
hey ronald.
sweet! oh, that is sweet!
i might.
i believe it too. he really just wants her to be happy.
marcuse. yeah. he was my mentor. he had a major influence on the new left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
i wouldn't pull the trigger if i were you——
perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, lieutenant. there were things i tried to tell you too - about having faith.
i don't even know what i'm looking for!
i wish my funbags would get bigger.
he's nothing like you.
renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
i understand how you feel, cookie. it's sort of rough -- one american squealing on other americans. then again, cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an american at all. maybe he's a german the krauts planted in this barracks. they do this type of thing. just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. could be, couldn't it?
how?
why?
jordan.  i always hoped we'd get together -- though just now i'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
yeah.
it's about me.
faster.  and i want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
what if one hasn't a soul any more? what of that?
well, i wanted to make sure she's the same girl i sent.
i'm not lying.
oh.
i might.
she mentioned, of course, that margo expects to play the part?
what is this place?
i paid the money.
that's the price, my brother.
how's austin?
suspect's words -
i don't think so.
leave us alone, stephens.  leave the people of this town alone.  you can't help.
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. she has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. we have been paid to look the other way. i came in here to take your money.  i brought snapshots to show you. so i could get your money.  i can't take it. if i take it. if i take that money i'm lost. i'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  i can't do it. i can't take it.
bobs
y'all take american express?
after making love. i like it. it's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
yes sir!
no, carter.  i can't take this.
keaton, i can't just -
he freaked out when he thought i had seen this stuff.  i think it's a list of cities -- santiago, ho chi minh city, nandi ...
you got jimmy. let her go.
yeah -- me.
you forgot this.
please.
why don't you use the phone downstairs?
i see. and what's strasser doing here? he certainly didn't come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
alright.  i want you to leave and go back to new york.
what am i, five?
wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, i can't explain it, but i've seen it.
but with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
no, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  i don't have luck with women. there was this girl i met while i was in college.  i slept with her once.  she started following me around, taking my picture.  she dyed her hair, copied my clothes. lisa something... oberman.  it was awful.
i'll give you a check.
i'll be done in a minute.  you misspoke before.  you're not "stepping down."  i'm taking you out at the knees.  the whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  i'm firing you. action's taken.  confidence restored. stock goes up.  i sell my shares.
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
look here, roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  the girl will marry best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  you are but a boy.  best is willing to consider you as such.  dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  make best an apology, and be off.
she gonna be long?
praying.
well, i'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. let me borrow her dossier for a while.
have you ever seen him?
that wasn't the bargain.  you said the empire wouldn't interfere in--
barks at the mention of food. licks his lips.
take a walk, pal.
what the hell's goin' on?
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
uh, yes.  my husband passed away recently ...
you joined up.
okay, martin. you have a good evening now.
he walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
i saw my grandmother, of course, but i don't suppose that counts. i mean, she was alive at the time.
better in san diego? more opportunity there? what?
it's fine!
we're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
jesus.  are you sure this is the street?
gone--  --over to your uncle john's. the whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. but they can't stay there either, because john's got *his* notice to get off.
radio! what is radio?
there were many men interested in you?
but the right guess on this is arson.
y'know what?  i'm ready to cancel our trip.  i really am. i've had it.
there's only three weeks left of summer, michael.  things are going to change around here when school starts.
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that i saw him take. so don't be calling him a rat.
what'll i tell fran?
fine. fine.
slam it?
chill, man! be cool! this isn't even my apartment!
"harassed."  cause i yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  the guy's a thief, he took my...
"making pictures." i like that. you really love what you do, don't you?
there ya go.
mmm hmm.
she'd have to be really pretty and i'd have to be very drunk.
i'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. i'm gonna--  don't tell me to shut-- it's none of your business.  man, i can talk all i want to.
that's enough.
if i was to think...if i were to think... no i mean i have thinked it over...i have. and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just...well i just...
they're killing him!
what the hell are these?
hi.
i see.
but...
i wanna hear about it.
oh, yeah ? i don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
god damn!  god damn!  chuck, it's you!
congratulations, eve.
startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
susan!
just one minute...
but dear lord, are we intelligent enough to -- suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
i said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
yeah.
...i was <u>working</u>...
do you know what you’re doing?
they've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
he said that if i got a divorce i'd burn in hell.  for all eternity.
jim, it's just that i like the kid-- i don't want to see you get too rough on him.
what about that ugly dog?
i, i tried to go back for him, to save him, but i couldn't get to him in time. the fire... have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? it's like a liquid, it slides over everything. it was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. and then he was gone.  i never told anyone until now. but this ship knew, dj. it knows about the goliath, it knows about corrick. it knows our secrets. it knows what we're afraid of.  and now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
one, two, three... 
...yeah, fifty-three.
everybody say, "bye, house."
then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
stop looking at me like that! i'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  and my life is not a cosmic whim!  i am in charge of my life -  - and i want to stay.  everything that was taken from me is here, michael. all these years, she was there without me.  helpless. i should have been here.
you were enlightened?
i just thought you should know.
you want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
so what's my share of the dress?
about me? how sweet.
what i'm saying is, is that the king ain't gonna care. see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy, if you ask me i think he's jealous.
they're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker. why, in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
what?
you'll be sorry, beckett.
are you apprehensive?
hey! come out here!
i could take it or leave it.
oh yeah? how'd you find me?
what do you mean "got" to the dog?
i don't know, but i am.  she was there and then she was gone.  i felt it.
you.
wha-at? come on, there's another t.v. in the kitchen. you know you used to have a sense of humor.
michael doesn't understand. people who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. they keep it all in various accounts.
-- you saw this experiment?
please, have a seat.
of course.
high school... remember ? run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
sure it is. i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment.  but now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because i have to baby sit tonight.
morning.  did you sleep?
so bastaldi makes a deal with the feds to trade up for his brother?
what's that?
mommy, could edward take me to mrs. farren's house to give her her present?
i didn't say that.  i never said--
have you had any before?
they think i'll make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
where the hell are we going to go then, billy jack!?
"lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... do you think anyone's hurt?
i thought i made myself perfectly clear.  you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it.
operator...how much would the call be station-to-station?...thirty-five cents cheaper?...i'd still be short twenty cents ...just a second, operator...  colonel, shoot the lock off the coke machine.  there's bound to be enough change in there.
well. that was all took away, son, by the police. new regulation about compensation for the victim.
i'd take him to the doctor.
enjoying the tour so far?
now, listen! you never arrived here with this -- reprieve. get it?
fuck that, i mean, the heck with that.  i kicked their ass!  well, i tried.  there were two of them you know...
klingon bird of prey, sir! she's arming torpedoes...!
a heavy drinker?
i'm sorry.  i know i heard noises... the detective's wife...
she told us the story of freddy.  it's a town legend.  he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
no...
i think mary agnes could kill someone.
was the stone very smooth?  it was probably brought here from a sacred river.
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
hey, uh, mister? hey, okay if i grab a cue?
i mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
no wonder he let her go.
she does not!
hardly new news.
the recent past.
but what in the world can you do with a day off in st. sebastian?
of course.
jim, who do you think you're kidding?  a doctor's gotta look at that.  you can't sit up straight.
and what is ... this frozen moment?
i am, your eminence
that's boring!
what's that, dad?
preach! go down and get me some white tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
when's the last time you saw him?
5000 feet. speed two hundred.
yours not to reason why, miss teschmacher. relax! enjoy it!  just look at that smog!
i haven't danced with another man since mr. terwilliger passed.
i love writing. a-anne rice? i love anne rice.
make that sixty and i'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
and don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
if you think i am behind this, say it.
just be yourself.
where's the safe?
true?
oh, great.
he's very human.
can he save her?
what are you doing on the floor?  it's my fault. if i'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. here, let me help you back in.  i know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. there you go. comfy?
i know.  i'm ginger. miss april.
i don't like this, this...
i'm figurin' how i can say it so's you won't get mad.
i had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. in fact...you might say that mr. tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
magruder's conked out.  adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  he may come out of it and he may not.  as a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
what are you doing, boy?
oh, i told mister hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
i'll set john on you!
just move on. no one here killed him.
andy, it'll be fine!  it's what we're known for!  "maui?  "wowie!"
i have a friend you might like to meet.
that's his name... andy. our ticket out of here.
you're out of your mind, man.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
you owe me three-fifty.
title's the first thing's got to go. and the guy's name. i mean, even this writer's name, murray saffrin is better than "lovejoy".
you don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
more than eager.  he was out to make a point.
no, you look like a hooker.
it was like sex.  what else could it be like?
...can i come in?
that's because there's nothing to figure out. now will you please pay attention. i'm not through insulting your father.
so he can't write.  big deal. i mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
according to bembridge scholars, inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing the book of the living.
you probably.							 *
they're --  -- what?
really? for most people it's a rather pleasant experience. what exactly did you...
they feel cheated.
no, no. forgive me. i made a mistake. it was an inappropriate thing to ask.
no. the only thing to do is write general hammond.  but it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
how do we get to the vault door?
a child who can't die...
what is happening?
that's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  after the thirtieth. murray and mitch.  after the contest.
good night?
stop it.
no. i don't object.
hello?
i'm listening.
do you believe in them?
anna scott?
you'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. maybe some audio, too. to tie it all in to gary. how long would that take you?
i haven't really thought about it.
think about it...long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
what's that? what's it called?
we are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
i don't work for you, captain brynner.
...-ed.
over three-hundred.
jesus. listen, jill, tell you what. tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, i'll drive you down. i'll get off work or something.
you think he got my license plates?
no.
-- well, rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. he says that your deal memo has been signed by the arizona cardinals. four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  playing in the state where you grew up.
i'm hemorrhaging.
i'm here, ain't i?
okay.  i think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
no further questions.
--i'm not angry at you--
shut up.
i'll take them all.
you've no right to assault me in this fashion; i'll call for my footman. i'll have you removed --
you are contradicting yourself, donnie. if we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. the very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
hear you had a little trouble, quintero. defective fuse?  well, you're all in one piece. so what's the beef?
he works the boats as a "come-on" man. we ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
go to bed. you've got to be at work in the morning. there's nothing more we can do tonight.
that stupid hillbilly slut.
i know who you are! isn't it your picture in the newspapers? didn't i see you this morning on the video? are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
i hear you did time with old spook. yeah, he was a good egg. i used to run a lot of dope for him. fuckin' shame he got shivved.
well, kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but i think you'd have to say i killed old murdo. i think that's definitely the word.
what the hell.  the next year, tiebreaker for the division, in boston, yanks down two to nothing, bucky dent steps to the plate.
yeah.
shut them up!
sounds like my husband.  he never came back either.  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break.
good morning, citizen de beauharnais.
i'm not quitting!
welcome?
me either.
yeah, good, what else do you remember?
well, isn't it -- ?
actually, i don't know...
but wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
so you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, vincent.
i bet him he couldn't do it... i bet him a hundred dollars!
can you move at all?
how long was she in there?
hey, hey. happy birthday. why didn't you tell me?
ah yes, august gorman. have you looked for work this week, mr. gorman?
what is it you want?
the high lama arranges everything, mr. conway.
now... i wouldn't do something like that, johnny.  i like you.  i like you a lot.
needs salt.
think about that reward, johns.
you do it.
heather, i'm stuck here.  neither chuck or terry came in today.  i can't get away!
how long are they going to hold him?
nervous?
havanas.  you're not the smoker.  so who is?
wait...did you say off-season?
how many?
toto's my dog.
he's tough, your american friend.
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy.  when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren't sore at me anymore, godfather.
i hear you've been looking for me.
well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
jesus.
before you are.
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...
that depends.
you don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
i need you ...
enough of that!  name your terms.
are you the owner of this place?
everything okay?
i guess there's probably a story behind that.
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  no matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
i was going to stay with him, but he died thursday.
well... this.
and superstitious too. it's like witchcraft.
what?
what cards?
can't we do it on the phone?
cole, what the hell are you doing?
uhhh, va, uhh, vada.
is that what you think?
how old are you, son?
i'm gonna need more caps.
no.
this is about the "wanted!" posters, isn't it.
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  that's a direct quote
sorry friend, i had no choice. they arrived right before you did.
what's all the dreck?
hey, where you been?
i know —— i shouldn't have told you—
alright, beth, do that thing you did before.
i think you should then.  you should look in on sheila.
not me.  i was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
hardy, what are you doing --
how do you like them jokers? taking me for a pigeon.
personally?
then you gotta hide it somewhere. somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
tell that to the pigs. better yet tell that to malcolm.
i don't understand.
no, it is.  look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a space ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy!  you are his toy.
what was i supposed to do?  i told the truth.  why should the truth upset you?  it's not as if you're from a convent.
very realistic.
c-18.
no kidding.  he's a criminal.  i heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  he just got out of alcatraz...
taken.
according to my readings, our friend suffered the hom-dai, the worst of all ancient egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. in all of my research, i've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
kevin.  how's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
railroad tickets.
happened...yes happened right down there.
what?  what?  what, jim: i tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
it has a pas-sion, 'the con-ti nen-tal...'
hi ma.
she was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. where it says "no dumping."  her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   it's all different but it seems so -- the same. artificial and <u>posed</u>... something's wrong with it.
so you lied to her?
you, uh... i'm sorry, sir, but -
they could see that i meant it.
can't talk right now.
what do you mean?
may i see them, master hardenbrook?
very good, very good. now, when your visitor comes today i want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. i will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. if you have any trouble with any of the words, i'll help you. i'm sure you'll be just fine. if you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then i'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? i will say "may i introduce you to mr. carr gomm." and you will say...
okay. she's really pretty great, isn't she?
the greasy pole.
what?
he's recovering on the third floor.
he's your son.
what are you talking about?
so where the hell are you, healy?
i'm talking about your people, not you.
yeah let's hear about your day.
work!  don't say that word, man.
let's just walk, okay?
snow's to their advantage, kid. you can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. wise up.  take me to the yukon. i'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
damned clever if you ask me...
is she dying?
you don't seem to upset?
take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
b.o.c.a.
now don't get carried away-
is he not going?  i booked a flight.
where did the baby come from?
we could start a two-person stock company. if things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. we'll call this one "the great deception."[8]
hi ya doin' there, ike?
why should <u>you</u> care?
and that's how felicity came into the picture. during one of those two seconds.
but i have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. i plan on using them.
ahh!  ah!
you think i don't know what you're doing? you're so quiet all the time?  i know.
i was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
yeah?  according to this, he's in geneva from '76 to '79. well, i called geneva.  nobody there's even heard of the guy - - probably off in tibet with some kung fu master.
but if something should... god forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  it would look better in court.
i thought they'd be in coffins.
say something it's too quiet.
how are things goin' out there?
how old was she when this happened?
what vase?
what do you want ?
yes, the money is good.
what... bo-... what about the magazine?
i don't think you're being fair, sir. you assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
i don't drink.
and from my soul too. else beshrew them both.
defense against what?
tell me where you've been.  i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  my father was a jedi!  were you in many battles?
you want the red or the white?
a bad girl, miles. she might need to be spanked.
tomorrow? tomorrow... as quick as that?
i'm not just giving those tickets, baxter -- i want to swap them.
fine. i'll just wait here.
well, with a shark running loose around the place, i for one won't get aboard that raft! they'll have to catch it first. i want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
when are you going to be home?
no john, i can't. i can care for you, but i can't cure you.
i'm fine.
hiding? oh, no. hunting - i was in the interior - hunting fossils. this morning i looked up suddenly—
lloyd, it's us.
for christ's sake, they're kids.
have you no feelings, woman?
c'mon, don't be shy.  mmm, smells good.  this is ya love daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like marvin. say something, mookie.
tell me more about yourself.
do you have chromium tapes?  the others fog in high-
goals are important.
five years ... i still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, matty would still be alive.
parasolutrine?
one at a time!  clear the air!  louise?  talk to me.  what do we have?
loading a gun.
so they can have their hamburgers!
are you all right, dad?
at least i've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
there is always a way! but you are such a... a glotzkopp you cannot see! you'd rather go back to that city! to nothing! no woman! no children! no land!
you got the key?
visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  single action second, fasanella third.
you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. if i wasn't already the head of it, i'd want the same thing.
i'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello.
i got this little chick i'm tryin' to hit on.  she's about 20, 21... i take her to jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... i says, "hey, this is 1971, baby, i'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
sort of.  high spirit.  heh heh. listen, cookie, i've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  all i want is to get out.
knock it off!
that's good...
do you have my work number?
i'm just a hick who cuts lawns. but some of these look familiar.
did i miss anything?
michael!  this thing working?
only very rarely. you see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
tell me about yourself.  what you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.

they've been migrating north, kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
no. the other one. the one who disappeared up the block from christie. the one they made a beef on.
this unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with john?
thank you, won't you come in ?
wh... where are we?
cactus, i can't believe you just said all that...
what's plan c?
he gave me a look.
what's mine say?
two years ago? sorry.
do you know where they live?
we've been given a gift here, honey.  a real live little girl. she likes us a lot.  she needs us. maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  the house, antiques, your model.  look at us. we didn't have room for anyone.
yeah, maybe.
you know anything about the stations here?
he's got a gun, sir.
and the bulgarian?

no... not really... i mean, i think about it... but no, i don't really think about it.
just a favor for your old man.
where've you been? we've been trying to find you all morning.
somebody has to die.
i don't remember.  one day he was just here....
what are you gonna do? they're euro- trash.
is that what you think?  is that what you think i think?
me?  are you kiddin?  you're the one! you were a hero, man.  they gave you a pardon!  and whadda you do?  you come back and fuck with your teeth!  wow!
all this trouble for a horsey. i may not know art, but i know what i like.
what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.
we could live it up and --
yes.  yes, that's eminently fair of you.
what's that, sol?

jerk... what did you say?
i haven't been back for ten years. is your family still there?
stu? is that you? where did you <u>go</u>?
well, flea, i appreciate the respect you just showed me.  but i don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  it's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
and what did they say about me?
how old did you say you were?
me.  i am.
this is california. the richest, most populous state in america. and growing like a sonofagun.
i do not understand.
i thought i might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
i'm here with ed over at taxi. there's been some trouble with tony.
sounds great, swanney.
but what can we do? she don't know who's visiting her...
what are you doing here?
what is it?
i think she'll like this very much.
this thing's actually accurate. i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset...
in twenty-five minutes in the california ballroom.
don't worry, hon. young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
your a good guy chris you deserve a nice girl.

i need a shower.
you're lying!
jane, i'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
why not?
so who's going to do it?
is she gonna die?
teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. all for one and one for all -- know what i mean?

oh, come on - you can do better than that.
right, bridesmaid. now what have i left out? oh, yes, i know: the ring.
we came here to deliver some clean laundry.

there's talk of that.
from the looks of those boys, the ripper too.
i don't know. he was a lame, that's all.
much better, thank you, sir.
i don't buy that. there's a place for hatred.  did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her.  do you know what that feels like?
mom, you know that never works.
well, i know what my daddy's going to say.
where are you going?
how immediate is immediately?
so...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
i can't find him.
i'm kenny's aunt lisa.
you don't look like you.
promise?
let billie finish.
do you really think so?
whenever i get nervous i eat.
this fella nicoli's got a record in france, walter.  he's wanted for questioning in the murder of a french cop.
every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
i can't.
you know that song?
listen to this bullshit.  "this is our world now. the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. we exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. you wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. yes, i am a criminal. my crime is that of curiosity. i am a hacker and this is my manifesto." huh, right, manifesto? "you may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
look.  it's hobbes!  he's all right.
no, no, we just got her back together...
carryin' a gun.
it is not over.
now then, mrs. kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
no. i just wanted to see if you could light it that way. the guy at the newsstand can.
you'd like that?
no thanks, diz.
huh?
uh, yes!
josé doesn't like the deal in south florida...
so why do you want to be a taxi driver?

...should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
it's okay to use the phone.
well, home sweet home. i'll see you later.
how do i know?  but, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  i dunno.
so what i want to do is stop it here.  i'm going to make him an offer.  i want to do it myself.  i want it to come from me.
alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? not only that, you look thin and tired.
it isn't a broadcast studio. it's -- a surveillance post or something. that's why they have the dishes on top.
the guy is fucking insane.
dude, dogs hate me.  i don't know why. me and k-9's just don't get along.
i'm sorry. we don't.
she's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  i'm just helping her conceive, man!
uh-huh. i was worried about you.
dad, what the hell is going on?
what would you do...?
you might make a farmer yet.
i left it at work.
he came to see mr kinnear.
right's right, goddamnit! don't you care what's right?
oh, i would love to hear it.
lois, what are you doing?
no, wait, wait! wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! what is your name?
agent mackelway.
i'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
urrggghh...
daddy, where's my money?

you two faced bastard. i knew you were full of shit.
creasy.
and so you do! the only time you come out is to eat.
what'd you find out?
with who?
i know her uncle. friends of the family.
elaine, i haven't time to put this gently, so i'll be very direct. everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. mister striker is the only hope we've got.
you'll always be there.  in his mind.  the perfect creature he loved for all those y...
<u>you jerks</u>!  that is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  you think i want to die like that?  lydia.  moving is a family affair. so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs.
an' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to kansas an' cheyenne?
well, i didn't.
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods.  take leda for example, sleeping with jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... well, can you imagine leda announcing to her swan "you're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
well that's something.
margo in the cub room. i couldn't be more surprised if she'd said grant's tomb.
why? hell, not for any reason ...
"arkady"

five minutes to cloud boundary!
fuckin' asshole.
kubelik.
sybok.
now, dave old buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  what do you think of this husband of yours?  on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer.  but unfortunately, in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself -

i'm surprised you still are. should'a told me you had an a.i. running probes at you.
eleanor is memphis' "unicorn."

thank you for that scientific analysis, mister smith.
yeah, okay.
no, no. listen, i've been thinking --
well i interviewed damon once for the show. he was a real obnoxious fuck. any way, the second one, christine perkins, she had a part in stab 2, didn't she? she was playing cici.
and d) brooke is obviously hiding something.
son of a bitch!
i'm just a girl.
that voice --

god, it's so clean out here.
we're all on edge, smith. we're a long way out...
face it. with some guys you have to make the first move. a lot of guys are just... wussies.
have you been to  let's see -- santiago, chile?
have you tackled the great reorganization yet?
dad?
are they suffering?
you know you keep saying that.
speak up.
tell me about that job in alexandria, dave, the big motel you're building.
that's what i'm saying, will. you'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
you alright?
solis said to keep you clear of this.
you don't, you can't believe that ...
oui.

it's not you, johnny. your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. he's a veteran.
you are such a raving pussy sometimes.
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind.
to quarter-horses.
i heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at her majesty's pleasure."
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like i have any choice in barging in.

whatever happened to you?
why did you stop?
this is barry.
do you like talk like that?
wonderful -- if one could believe it.
- this is very disconerting..

why did he come out here? what's going on?
why?  you're a wudan fighter. training is everything.

you're telling me this maniac is a cop? what the hell am i supposed to do with that one?
thank you.
man, that is one george michael notch from being gay.
nothing, sir.
not in that repressed anger sort of way.
kittridge.
well, if i had to guess...  i'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  jack, do you know what i see here?
and gives it to you.
are you for real?
what happened to sam?
i trusted you.
it's too late. i've already ruined my life.
i don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not san quentin, it's just a nuthouse. most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
bob -- are you making friends with this man?
i'm sorry.
hello, mr. m.
i'll be in my quarters. execute course to the federation boundary.
what are we waiting for?
didn't i teach you to always arch your back?
you know i'm going to be twenty-five in june?
you don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. you go. don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. concentrate on the sound itself.
i go home and paint the kitchen.
he couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  peter, what time were you born?
hid by day--fought by night.  at sunset one day, your father and i, peering through field glasses, saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn.  it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the beast of yugoslavia.
ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
it's not magic! it's just a trick!
... why the mask?
that's good, but heather would never use the word "myriad."
the turkey in?
hello?
jail?
now that don't make much sense.
you ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser.
they asked who would be best suited for this and you--
write that down.
we will all be put in the clink.
this is un-fucking professional.
this car will take me to las vegas. i cannot go back.
your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
she's the sweetest person i've ever known. loves kids. works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. everybody loves her.
yes, michael.  harder--.  more...
i been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. an' i been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
go on. spill it.
yes, sir, but ... do you think gray'll go for it?
fan-fucking-tastic?
i thought i told you boys to go to bed!
what's this?
gentlemen, let me get to the point, i can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against general arnold.
she hates dem.
of him i think.
he's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
indeed... may i offer you gentlemen anything?
you all right?
and did everything -- ?
he did something with the ground.
brady!
you mean, josh's father had nothing to do with it?
it's kind of a sports bar
how did you she was a nazi?
i don't have a lot to say, michael.
why not?
he just let it explode.
seriously.
hello, hildy!
that was fun. i don't think california is bad at all. it's a drag coming home.
so, scott, why don't we start with you. why are you here?
then you got no excuse for living. what the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, beni? what's in it for you?
...figured i'd better leave before i used it on him. i don't know how you can stand him.
i do.
oh, thank g-d!  i'm not just super fat!
yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
...you're ed crane?
no, mom -- keep it on!
no, i didn't.
jeff!
be a mohican.
is that the man i knew, treasurer sanchez?
it's our pleasure.
i've got you, keitel blacksmith. if you go... i go too...
come on, mom. don't fall asleep...
what are you doing?
like a stroke?
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools, anyway? strap you down and pump the nature out of you? they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck. why, send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy. jesus h.m.s. christ! if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps. oogie boogie.
sent it where?
oh yeah, and then what?
i've got to talk to you...
no you didn't.  but he did change. just not enough.
if one of you can get that  -- i mean, i want the real superman. who is he? where's he from? what's his favorite ball team? what's up?
warscheinlich ist der murder.
hey, auggie, i've just been thinking. you wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? some summer help while vinnie's gone?
we'll find it.
how??
good.  i hate to worry.  i got ulcers.
i don't know.
i'm doing okay.
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions?
why, beckett?
i told you i was positive.  the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was.
i don’t know what you’re talking about!
you bitch!  you were in on it froom the start!
all right.  since you put it that way.
no reason to get nasty.  yeah, i've stayed in the organization.  but then again i never got the percentage you did.
why not? we should get some of that. just eat a big handful and see what happens.
set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
why? what's his problem?
hurling's a fast game, isn't it, fergus?
but i haven't . . .
sadist!  i can't believe i thought you could change--this is your idea of discipline?  you're a monster.  that kid is going to be traumatized for...
on the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
what time is it?
your scrunchie?
you don't have to do that.
look, i'm running out of time. i need your help.
he's only just dead.  what was i supposed to do with him?  i can't take him away anywhere.  and nobody wants to take him for me.  do you?
and then she said, 'since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
i want to die.
position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees...
this was his nightmare. the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. i knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. he had to. if he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in saughton.
okay everybody, listen up. i've got rachel corruthers and her sister in the truck, and i'm taking them outta town route 410. state police are on the way. got that?
give him the tape.  see?  it's fucking brilliant!  the tape for faith.  i know he'll go for it.  i can set it up.
you're so wonderful. the jewelry's not so bad, either.
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it.
well, i don't want to starve them too long.  they die.
uh... dudes?
i don't "rationalize" anything. i'm his lawyer -- he's my client. that's all.
according to the map, we're just about at school.
i'm not screwing around with you man...i hate the cold water.
roll him over!
then what have we been doing? i mean what was the point?
eh! love...what a mystery!  i understand you, toto...the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  eh, there's nothing to be done about it! the heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. and if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
do i take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
solved the whiteman case with this.
jeez, mary... i'm...
well, i go to a psychic and she's always telling me i'm psychic. she should know. do you believe in that stuff?
it's safe, try it, you'll see.
i think.. i...i realized...i love you.
i said she's been missing for-
so, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
is jenny gonna be okay?
mom -- is there something wrong with mr. carpenter?
brian.
hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  it's not a map, max. it's our balls. you know what i mean...  ...i gotta get laid man, i don't know 'bout you guys, but if i don't get it on soon, i'm... i'm not gonna make it.
i've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- i shouldn't have let somebody like willie go in there with me.
he's the only cat left that still grooves me.
fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
now, let's get down to particulars. how big is this thing? where is it to be? how many boys will it take care of? if they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? your bill has to have all that in it--
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
*you* find out, i can't.
i can't be dicking around here. that's all i'm saying. i don't carry crystals, i don't wanna come back in another life. i just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
all right, it's a matter of death.
ellie -- i'm getting married.  her name's laura.  she came up to owens valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
gary, how we doing, big stallion?
the action is in the front, not in the back. bring 'em up front.
i got delayed. i --
you would do that?
this is our oil from our estates?
an experiment? hey, i've seen you before.
does it bother you? what he said?
you look exactly the same.
i am so sorry!  forgive me, i --
you got a real good memory, star.
how's your business, jake?
well, he'd have to hurry.  my flight leaves at four o'clock.
that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen. why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?
no.  we go. 
well...flashlight?
i might break you, nice guy, but i'd make you my dog's bitch. you'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy t-bone hound.
thanks, sister. how are ya.
...free-lance. you know.
my daughter, barbara, died when she was six. that was long ago. you're only the woman who keeps care of me. i know you.
shit, skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
...you don't happen to remember the plan i outlined to you the day i set fire to your off -- uh, the day i was promoted?
that's all right.  well, we'll be going.
bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
grandma was still alive. chiro was still home going to school. now he's married and gone to florida. if you and johnny moved in, had a baby...
there.  and don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
all right. good luck with veronica. if you want, i can talk to her, you know, and explain...
uh-huh.
listen, angie, i wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. i introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. now, why did you do that?
what's that?
you're gonna kill him, ain't you?
yes.
you'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
did they argue the day before he died?
i don't know.  i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  i don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  i don't even know when it's going to happen.
you start closing again, you'll be on the board.
don't move, any of you. they've gone potty out there. the whole place is surging with girls.
you've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
how would i know? i once bet a horse. he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
i do it all the time!
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  he has educated feet.
pat does projects all over the world.
you done impressing yourself, ace?
that's great coming from you.
yeah.
what's wrong?
come on, ray, time to go!
like what?
right now?  never let another writer read your stuff.  he may steal it.
it's webber.  adam webber.
this is mr. hudgeons, wendell.
let me have those.
not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
congratulations on your apprehension of mr. freeze.  batman monopolized the evening news.
who is he, his name?
see? the princess is under there ...
don't.  i'm the one at risk here. if we're playing out what happened before, i won't survive.
what's the big deal? take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
i'll help you with the coffee.
well...all <u>right</u>!  we just roll on out of here!
i like to keep it professional, that's all.
your husband is ill, ma'am. he took sick. i brought him home.
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. i'm sorry you got hit by it.
i've got to get moving. terry will bust my chops if i'm late. see you in september, auggie.
that's swell!
i've got immunity now. what can you possibly offer me?
i don't want to "save" you. i just want to be with you. i love you. i love you!
that the old actress -- julia farren?
...i mean, does it have to be "goofy"? i was playing hamlet off-broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
yours... is... the superior...
yeah... do you mind if i sit?
to a girl. here.
when i came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. i told you to turn off the tv when you were through.  come to think of it, i also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
you will take them all, mr. jimmy?
before you start picking your nose, i know he put you up to it.
we have to find out what's happened to them. i think they're gone...
got it.
what's the other name?
how long was that?
catholicism is not on trial here. i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
holy shit.
i don't know. he was just so charming. all he did was talk about how i had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. things just got out of hand from there.  mom? are you there? mom?  mother!!!!
what do we do now?
nice *compliment*!
thank you.
lord, you're stubborn.
it's a difficult situation, and i want you to know i appreciate it. tonight's going to be real tough for me --
they let you out?
anouk isn't like a dog, really.  more like a small person.  so is there anyone here for me?  no one looks new.  who's that?
listen, you're very nice... b...
then put him with the feldmans. whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me.
now, dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. you always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
i never was no good with history.
cotton.
i's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
where?
oh, that has nothing to do with it.
what're you doing later?
mr. john mitchell, the head of creep, says it means nothing.  "...this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
...yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
affirmative.
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you? you know?
they're going to stop me talking to you.
do you remember me, mr. garrison?  i met you on carondolet street right after your election.  i congratulated you, remember?
are you ready now?
she's . . .
that j.d. kid is a little shit.
captain=8a
more?
daya deo dono dato.  dalutan!
i'm not dumping you, i'm suspending you.
be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
this is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
...i'd like knowing what he's listening to...
six months ago, a police lieutenant named charles fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
it wasn't a woman.
why you shaking me off?
but now we've lost access to craig.
yes, they are.
but what makes a thought start?
all right, father, i'll ask him!  if i risk my neck for you, will i get a chance to kill englishmen?
what are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
a can opener! a $39.95 can opener. i canceled payment... it was junk.  you ever bounce a check, lowell? you ever look at another woman's tits? you ever cheat a little on your taxes?  whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
that guy is in our cemetery.  oh, adam.
so the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
you don't like where i live?
ssh!
i've been calling for days!
well, yes.  yes, in fact.  a little on the outside, yes.  and there's been all this friction.
you're parents at that party?
i promise.  i won't.
i guess i'm startin' to feel a little better.
jade.
i want my fucking money --
not exactly modern.
great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
no ... thanks though... i'll take a cigarette if you have one.
mouth's clean, too.
she didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. that stuff was all gone through last night.  anything special you're looking for, inspector?
it's strange, being in love... it's the first time for me...
but you like him.
i love you so much.
she was sailing up north, right?
and jonas?
go.
they do.
it's great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
so how's that book of yours going, miles? i think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
get out.
you can go back to bed...or lois might let you go swimming.
he's right.
you bet.  paid for a check-up for the whole family.  and not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  they just took care of it.  just like that.  we never even saw a bill.
everyone - this is michael curry.
uh... bob. like to speak to you. take a minute.
the agents --
then he may be caught on a ledge! look again!
it's nonsense.
principal's office? yeah, i guess i can swing that.
i've got to stop him.
ed, i got the lugosi lookalikes outside.
a bit of one.
and not a word of them to father. he's agitated enough not hearing from victor.
ooh, wow, nice. personal trainer? very nice.
what's wrong with it?
floris, you're very nice, but i'm afraid i’m in love with somebody else.
i didn't know there would be a quiz, george.
or a cover up!  jesus, bill, don't you have enough proof of the fbi's complicity now?
why not?
i prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. see, so what are yuh telling me-
what?!!  since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
damn, i'm proud of you, boy.  i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber. the world would tremble.  now, time for some r and r.  you're invited to the royal victory party!
o, she's all right.
where am i?
you could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, meat.
why not? harry says that's the only way to do good.
well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. jesus christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
it's a matter of definition. faithful in spirit, yes.
sort of a trial balloon.
underwear?
well, are you going out again?
certainly not!
mother's going to help me with the invitations.
come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  you could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  let me buy you a drink.
it was you, galbraith!
much too young.
what's the matter?  upset that i rubbed off on her?
"home cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
misery's return?
well, thank god we are rid of her at last. and the best thing of all is that she's happy. the little nut is happy, she found mr. right in the nick of time!
hey, baby, that's good!  how'd we come out?
he's not with us, xander. he must be with you.
carl.
no!  i'm not going any further! it'll wreck my car.
i'm looking at you.
his girlfriend?
i have to go to new york tomorrow.
this is fuckin michael jordan, man! they should be screaming.
do you want me to stick around?
oh you've got to. he does such fun things with imagery. and i've been reading the fall --  -- the fall by ahlbair camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
there isn't anything you can do.
well, we don't exactly have a costa rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
mr. willis?
he sent me to find ya. he says he's got information.
that bitch from...
i can't take you to my place.
i seen her... i seen claudia too...
no.
what?  i may lose it again? but i haven't found it yet! i'm sorry. goodbye!  yes?
what the fuck is she doing?! she was supposed to be here three hours ago!
classic.  absolutely classic. profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
do you work in justice zinnowitz' office?
no. i don't need money anymore -- i see that now.
my flesh and blood!
well, let's see, we've got double a's --
that's not bad at all.
nice night.
a layman..., layman. interesting term. so many experts on government grants. and you say you're a 'layman?' but it was you who caught me, wasn't it, will? do you know how you did it'
time to quit.
but the jacket? i mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
then something woke you. what? did you dream...? what was it?
uhhh, gahdam stuff!
what're you lookin' at me for?  i'm not his next of kin.  anyway, i don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
i can read it to you.
me too.  for the most part.
hey, enough fun and games. we have work to do. come on junior. kastle heads for his car. junior gets up and follows. the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands.
i don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
excuse me?  could i say something?
exactly.  so... logically ...
so, mrs...
well, i think i've had enough.
don' need you okayin'.
now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  statue of liberty?  entertain some ladies? miss saigon tix?  seduce some women?  play nintendo?  bone some chicks?
son of a bitch!
i'd say you're moving.
nervous?
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
what about the other night. what about last night?  was that to get to know your character?
but what about your theory? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it.
going where?
no.  because the bus went off the road.  and crashed.
let's get out of here; it's too painful.  i hate it.  we went bowling last weekend.  next weekend we're going to the zoo. whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
yes...
haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
tis the truth.
it is i, arthur, son of uther pendragon, from the castle of camelot.  king of all britons, defeator of the saxons, sovereign of all england!
when do i get to lathrop wells?
the 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  can i tell you more?
not really.
i know what i did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much i want that gold.
you're cheating on george? jennifer, how could you?
who know?  we get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
i mean to come to my opera. you are the only colleague who did.
i'm, uh, going to bed.
we've met.
_we_ sure are.
and jewish men like to get it.
"routine," my ass!  ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
if you can say all you gotta say in a minute then i don't wanna hear it.
way i see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
a sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
no.
i pay my debts.
how is she?
calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
hold on --
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
i'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
yes.  before we hand in the next video - i put titles on it and my credit is going to read - directed by oleg razgul.
sort of shorthand.
i got lots of presents.
i'm what counts out here! not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' tv shows! and what the fuck are you doin' on tv anyhow?!
search me! when i come to i was running down thirty-fifth street.
the black beverly hills. i knew this lady from ladora heights once.  "hi, i'm from ladora heights, it's the black beverly hills."
now, wait a minute, chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for god's sake don't give up on yourself! you have to fight! you can't let those bastards keep you down! i don't want to hear any more from you about the 'room upstairs'. that's where i'm going soon.
maybe not even that, uther. i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. but it'll take another, a greater king...
... gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american. but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... kinney, what did you come up with?
[you want to talk, lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
where are they?
you're american.
what are you smiling about?  they'll be back.
it's a jungle out there.
drink up, it's party time.
thank you very much, deputy minister.
steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. the town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, dude.
how are you, kelly? would you like to take a break for a minute?
did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
what is it, alfredo? right now, of all times!
i couldn't say anything.  i just stood there, hating her.
mr. fink hasn't given a preference, mr.  lipnik.
"music for old people." what does that mean?
but what are you doing here?
it's not a good case.  it's a very good case.  a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
with repeated exposure to toxic levels -- god, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
michelle.
it's spectacular...
yo, you think we killed that guy?
and you wrote that...
did you pull me out?
you hear that, beavis! we're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
wbat're you talking about?
can i say something, here?
he's serious. vince is fuckin' serious!
'asian dawn movement?'
newt.  newt, wake up.
meet me at the other location.
how is our current financial status?
yeah, i stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  that's also on the display.
what kind of name is that?  to be named after a city?
have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, jake?
slip-stream.
i've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom.
are you staying with a friend, sir?
yeah.
we'll sleep here tonight. you'll come home with me. we'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
oh really?
she's probably smash you in the fucking face.
you know what the scottish call it?
think eddie had something to do with it?
you didn't give them a name.
rich bitches.  they're a plague. they've gotta be stopped.
i gotta go home.
don't give me that!  i was on the bridge.
after everything.
excuse me.
got a warrant?
explain what? how you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
philistine.
yes?
tight security.  no guns.  real plus.
what's that?
helena, i'm so sorry --
that your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
the landlady -- as far as i could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
i was upset.
i remember spring break of my senior year.  seems like a lifetime ago.
last time billy-boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  sad in a way. why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
he's turned into a completely normal person!
i need something tangible. to hook him. i told him i'd found the confidential file on the suspect zero theory.
you never were...
unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
well, yes -- usually -- i'd just changed to go home -- but i thought i'd just deal with this final call.
want one?
i just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. maybe i better go.
everything on this module is locked and sealed.  we've lost 'b', 'c', and 'e' wings, but 'e' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
hit a couple of jazz clubs.  fell back to her place.
oh, actually it was.  then why'd you call it off?
you know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and i can't put my finger on it.
i've seen guys like you go under before. guys that never had a worry. then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. the first thing that happens to a guy—
we need more bars!
of course. you, too. like everyone else in this goddamn country.
i know.
you think so?
write me a note and ain't she sweet. i need a hand and where'd she go.
lie down!
let's get back and call this in.
ain't it the truth. the two say nothing for a beat -
looks like tonight.
you're not listening. he isn't better. he gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
movie producer? yeah, why not.
well...
so what s on your mind kimosabe? why am i listening to you? got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
i've considered that.
polaris, where are you?  maybe i'm too far south.
do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
to tell you the truth, i'd just about given up waiting.
did you catch corbett?
may i speak, sir?
i think you're right. so come on, i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
yes, he has some hard bark on him.
-- may i? it's so --
not really. maybe if i just saw him on the street i'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... i don't know, unusual.
you're not crazy, by the way.
what do we do now, everett?
easy, kid, easy.  now, you hear that, ned? the kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
i don't know. i don't remember doing it.
it's not talking, it's mimicking.
oh no -- this is just getting worse. i am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
mr. boone.  you're not due to cut the lawn until wednesday.
m'sieu giron is downstairs.
why did you people come here?
but not now?
i'm not.
it doesn't matter to me.  what do you mean by that?
hey, just cancel that shit right now! you're hurt. you're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
really?  then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
is it?  william says now you have requested a british commission, why not colonial?  i'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! your dream come true, george, the only dream that really matters to you.
brad?
please don't ask me to go back again. i'm frightened! i'm very, very frightened.
how much?
let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
how often you go?
the university computer is down for maintenance, but i've been going through my own notes...
those things can be dangerous. staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  you can lose yourself. you should get out more.  how are you going to meet boys?
charlie, what do you think of richard norvik?
four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for team kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
there must have been somebody.
supposing she's an assassin?
i can't believe this!  <u>i</u> sleep in coffins!
that's great, thanks.
and when you finish?  what then?  this package, whatever it is, do you give it to the cia?  do you really think they deserve it?
it's true.
you sell it.
she said, "you know."  that i know.
ah, lieutenant doolittle? sir?
what's the line?
i'm sorry... i didn't know.
much better this morning, thank you.
we've decided, signor ferrari. for the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. thank you very much.
no, you would not, louis. danger hold you to me.
it isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he's got them to cancel the fair.
no.
listen to me, johnny. come in! you're out there all alone... we're getting close... real close... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
oh!
that's a lot of ground to cover.
go home!
do you want to make love? you're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. you're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. do you want to make love?
up yonder. see the lights?
i want all these passages sealed! another stupid idea of my father's! seal them all, every one!
mr. kazuzo sent me.
112 orchard way. [realizing, in a whisper] you're not coming back, are you?
vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. he works at the funeral home. and frank. you know frank likes you a lot. he says you make him feel calm.
kids? what about them?
what would you a done if he'd been released?
for starters. of course i had to kill the teddy bears, as well ...
how much?
they're acting very strange suddenly.
all right.
look, i know you're upset.  i'm really sorry, honey.  i raced home as quick--
i'm out.
so what are you going to do about her?
yeah. took me a year before i could bend my knee -- but i got over the girl in three weeks. she still lives in cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every christmas.
what about the killing and looting? that's just as crude, isn't it?
john, say hello to my wife...julia.
you know the fuck not.
i want to thank you.
you're still convinced there's a link to the department?
we have no radio.
why can't you be nice to me?
i found something in my sleep. the friar who married them will take up their destinies.
the significance of the moth is change. caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... billy wants to change, too, clarice. but there's the problem of his size, you see. even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
it seemed like a possibility. what about your intentions?  are they honorable?
what are <u>you</u> doing?!
knock-knock.
you really believe that?
i'm not hanged yet.
get'chu at that table up yonder.
are you chewing gum?
yes.
committee.
sorry, i'm way behind.
is that what you're worried about? looking bad at the pta?
so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, don't they?
oh, no i won't my dear - oh, no i won't my dear - i'll wash behind my ears, but no i won't my dear!
nope.  darrell.
you know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. at least swifty's did.
a what...?
oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, sir launcelot, from the court of camelot.  i have come to take you ...  away ... i'm terribly sorry ...
christ no!
hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
what, for example?
okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. voila!
you were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
why should i feel such pain?  should be the other way round... i could vex you... make you dance your life away...
what happened? what did he say? did you get the job?
you sure you heard what i said?
give me a name, any name, just so i got somethin' to call you.
must be painlees pole day in the shower tent.
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you?
then what?
but these, like, white supremacists trashed my office, last week.
no.
but why this pattern?
i'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
what's troubling ya, buddy?
our son just called me a bitch.
okay, you're in there and we're out here.  what do we do now?
frida. i was looking for you. you changing jobs?
oh it does???
i'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
nice try.  if we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  i can guarantee you, taransky, one way or another, miss simone and i are going to get acquainted.
standing right here in my office.
is this your homework, larry?
i think i should spend the night here.
what will you do?
i can't do that.  it's dangerous. what about my parents?  do you know where i can find them?
do you want a fruit plate?
i love it.  she's got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
don't gas me, fink. if you're opinion mattered, then i guess i'd resign and let you run the the studio. it doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum. so let's put a stop to that rumor right now.
i am truly sorry.
who are these guys?
you promised you'd meet projections, alan.  a dollar sixty per share you said.  so, i don't think this is so surprising a visit.
seems like a nice place.
what! who?
dr. frederick fronkonsteen.
he'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the sec. and a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. the least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! from one sucker!
do i make you nervous?
you're lying --
too easy. there's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. don't you think?
he could have died.
you'd think they could at least send a ship. bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this klingon flea trap...
where've you been?
what d'you mean, any happier?
big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
i knew he wouldn't come.
i so agree. how did you acquire a taste for it?
go ahead.
what're you so happy about? you're on trial for murder.
how about the record room for any incident reports? he might be a victim. we can get medical records. check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
well, no, i don't see any way.  and i know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
i do - we do - both of us, ben and i feel so much for chauncey...
alright.
there, that's nice. i have to have my pictures when i travel. and freddy of course.  isn't that right, sweetie.
he's a white male... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. and he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. not an apartment.
hey, what's the rush?  c'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
is it?
i don't remember saying yes.
then you come out here.
no it hain't, luke. you ain't alone. ever whar you go, i'm with you, and so's john.
look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  and i have to get home to my family.
there are things about love--
you like me now, jimmy?
i love you, old man.
you know her?
naw.
really.  you sleeping?
why not?
i don't want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
keeping of the souls. do they still burn their dead or something?
who else phoned?
i was being foolish?
well, all the same, i'm going to advise starfleet and get instructions.
i sure hope this isn't permanent.
oh come on, you've talked to her. she doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
i want to talk to you.
i wanted this to be a date.
how did you survive?
just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  no harm admitting i fell in love with the sound of you.
she has no idea who i am.
it's ok, booth, it's no big deal.
i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon, muswell hill.  watching doris day.
very hurtful.  your mother tell you to say that?
yes, well...  i know my brother.
not to me.  but you will let that cop go home with mr. kane, won't you?
uh-huh. you could’ve waited for me inside.
no, it's our problem, mark.  if i don't deal with this, they really might try to take jacob.  you said she committed suicide?
you want to see my friends?
sir!
hey gus--did you see the story idea i left on your desk?
you've had enough. why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
sure.
yeah? who is it?
i do.
yeah.
no--
right.
no, it can't be, because he's a comic.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
what did we learn in school today?
honestly, letty.
david, cut it out. mark davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
well, how much would you like?
leon, i would like to ask you something.
my loyalties... were in doubt.
clear?
you don't know? what time did your mother do this? when did she leave?
you're not going to fail me are you?
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
applejack drove.
electro-shock therapy, my friend. five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
it's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
well, my father left us when i was five-years old. he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew... let's get back to brown & williamson. if you decide to go on "60 minutes," i got to know everything about why you got fired.
she comes in the daytime.  she still with me, my denver.
what brought this on?
this is the apartment we have reserved for you, comrade yakushova. i hope you like it.
what he went through in <u>albania</u>...
...yeah...
follow me, please. the archbishop would like a word.
you hope what feels good?
the lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... i think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
hey... did we uhm, you know....
call me "sir," harold. first thing you learn in the army - an officer deserves your respect.
i'm sorry, i don't know what that was.
which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
he done a year in japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. four years he been in the field...
what happened?!
where have you been?
we used to take baths together.
i didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  jesus.  look at me. what do i have this afternoon?
take the hood off, fergus --
if you was to let that money serve the lord's purposes, he might feel kindly turned towards you.
you just came back home, daddy. i don't wanna leave right now -- i wanna stay home and be with you.
i was there in the dream.  he took her. it was awful.  it was awful...
what'd you do with the leads?  you want to go in there?  i tell him what i know, he's going to dig up something...you got an alibi last night?  you better have one. what did you do with the leads?  if you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
my name is eddie.
report!
thanks.
they'll soon be over.
roper.
but i thought, i don't know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
happy birthday.
do you remember me, i left my car, yesterday.
don't even.  you're not going to show me that tired map.
nels reporting in.  sit down where you are.  arms folded.
... do you think we should look for him?
remember the last guy she got involved with? what was his name?
dr. evil, do you really expect them to pay?
not exactly.
landon! join the expedition.
behold!
margo, this is too dangerous.  you always think you can solve everything.  this time you don't have enough information.  the animal might behave in unexpected ways.  leave her here with me.  don't put her in danger.
when did you get in?
i'm too old for this shit.
he's crazy. don't listen to him, wilkins.
no, i need my car --
he was slow.  very simple.  they won't all be that easy.
jesus, i don't know...
here ya are.  keep the change.
"thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
where the fuck were you, man? i was dying in there. we were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
you and i are the same, darien. we're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
the next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  his fingers... his fingers...
the key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? okay, mank, you're dying. what's the last image that comes to you? right now.
no!  i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
we declared war again?  are you scared?
so where does this lead ?
so? tell me: how come they call you "freb" anyways -- ?
so -- what do we do now?
then what would be enough?  if we were married?
hello, mitchell. having fun?
no, it's okay.  see, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... i'm not making sense, am i?
hey, baby, it's cool.  captain just reassigned me to the feds.
shit!
welcome back.
it's good to see you.
your shrink always gives you bad advice. he only hears what you choose to tell him. mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
i know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. terrible about her father, isn't it?
which also means when i speak, i'm speakin' for jimmy. so e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
in the same fashion as chess.
then why did you have anything to do with him?
you were lucky today, vice boy. captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, i'm watching you.
was dark... find a light...
he's probably very tired. you see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
it's one hell of a job.  what do you put on your passport?  profession -- mel gibson's bottom.
you're shitting me!
macy struthers -- god i must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
yes. one of my friends was there. i wonder if you ever clipped her.
don't worry, madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. she long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. the girl is permanently barren.
great.  fine.  listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  i'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
why?
he'll win.
what?
oh, very different.  but not entirely... i mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  but not everywhere.  and more roads.  and buildings.
no!  i have to get there.
could be hers.  types match.  could be a lot of other people's too...
so tell me, tell me, i'm peeing in my pants.
oh, betty --
rob.  top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80's and '90's.  subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
and this happened before you and i hooked up?
follow him!
come on, john. what happened?
it'll come back, daddy.
this bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
..or hard wired..
because you've exceeded your shelf life, case. word on the street is you're a dead man walking. nice time for an employment opportunity. travel to exotic locales.
we're driving out to the country tomorrow night. just the four of us. bill, margo, you and i...
i do know to a certainty. and you know what's going to happen now. you should admit your situation. there would be more dignity in it.
got you.
five.  no one knows you're his father.  i thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
everyone's saying he's . . . dead. but i know that isn't true. i feel it in my heart. i think he just needs help.
i don't think i want that.
want to come again and stay
died there?  how?
nice car.  yours?
lieutenant, you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
i wonder if you could help me.
okay.  how much ammo you reckon you'll need?
who cares. don't bother me.
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
yeah.
you got a dog?
top ten.
the next half of the game takes place in arcade's brain, the city of truth. it's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. screamer comes faster here.  on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  gotta time it right though.
living across the street from a grade school. jesus.
and what does that mean?
death! death! always so glum! what about life, ninotchka! do russians never think of life? of the moment in which we are living? the only moment we really have? don't take it all so seriously, ninotchka. nothing is worth it. please... relax... i beg you, sergeant... smile!
oh, will! i'm sorry.
the obituary column?
no percentage in that.
i meant sally.
ricky?  where...what...
he was afraid of being exposed.  that's why he did it.
i have to ask you some things... are you taking any prescription drugs?
so be it, to the death.
oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
or would you rather i changed the subject?
over the gold.
because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. i mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
it's what they do.  it's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  depraved children.
look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab dylan and come stay with me on base.
dinner's in the warmer.  tell your father i may be late.
what you mean, no?
somebody's taken it.  i can't find it!
i'm going first.  taking the fire. if we go out together we're all dead!
what was his voice like?
what's the capitol?
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
close enough to walk to!
holy shit, yes!
so?
thanks for teaching me an important lesson. what makes a family is love, not blood.
because of kennedy?  are the same people gonna kill us, daddy?
yeah - but that time we stole old lady haggerty's stomach off the coroner's physician. we proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
is that you. d?
which cabin is rennie in, mr. mcculloch?
he left us.  we were no longer of use. saavik where is  the reliant crew? dead?
mister d'amour?
where is stephanie?
then what are you hoping i'm gon- na do? dissuade, or persuade you?
honey, baby, i <u>can't</u>. i can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. believe it or not, i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
why did you?
klingons... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia!! they seem to be more than just images...
--there had to be a white house overseer--
tina was a wonderful woman.
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year.
just every once in a blue moon, you know.
oh, the coldstream guards.  don't you take your hat off in elevators?
and not larry bird?  who's your favorite movie star?
missed you, cousin.
you catching my drift?
hello?
what?
no -- just me.
why won't you come with me? what are you so scared of?
take it easy.  i only asked because maybe i could, you know, let you have a little something.
we buried them, then we went to track.  it was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  we went faster. we caught up to them at kentucky ford.
yes? what is it?
i beg to differ.  one is a command decision on your part.  the other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
nix, the law!
paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up...  got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight i'm a rich man.
will you excuse me?
noooo...
not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
no, i didn't think she was. let me get the picture here. let me guess. she was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
is it a charge, sir?
she's right. they'll string her up.
it's fuckin' real!  it's fuckin' real!
and how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
oh god. . .
you look so, so...
you got the warrant?
from?
don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
my name's frank.  and furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
not a psychiatrist! she needs a priest! she's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! jesus christ, won't somebody help her!
we went to code blue...
it was only a few times...
nobody knows. there've been a lot of theories, of course. but we'll never really know for sure.
it's true then?
nice? he's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
no.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
sorry you're gonna die -- cause i'm gonna make it.
forty-two was a lean year around here.  the war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall.  not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  at that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
you must think i'm an awful sap, major.  just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
no, not that.
then who is?  come on, nell.  deep down, if you really thought it wasn't jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  why wouldn't you be afraid?  really afraid.

i wish to discuss your brother.
don't you understand?!  that thing didn't want to become a dog...
hi. i, uh, think that's us.

they're not going to listen to me. you either. are you kidding?
he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?
to win?
second district ... explain better ...
captain marion, i understood you to be a patriot.
because sunlight will kill him. quickly now, give me the key.

yes...
need to lose myself awhile.
so mitchell had handled it. afterwards, brandon picked it up.  there's no indication you handled it.
i'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.

frankie, johnny wants to say goodnight.
time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
what's going on here?
has anyone seen greg?
mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. i've seen people like you before, baby. double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. but you don't make it work forever.
my imagination isn't that good.
there's nothing wrong with this place.
but if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
robert - - i wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.

i'll get right to the point, larry. i'm a puppet now...
he wants me to testify?  is that what he's asking me to do?
illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
joe could help him. if we can get in touch with joe, joe could get him to a doctor, joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
eddie -- it's art esparza!

man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  the anthropomorphic problem. good, norman.
walter--
the fax machines.
you've been here longer than you think.
hello there.
there, mr. webster.  all open and above-board and in due and legal form.
he's working round the clock. but the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
come on, live a little. i'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
ever since you've looked after steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with steve. the girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
good evening, ninotchka.
do you know what it is to be in a coma?  it fucks up everything -- including your memory! i can't even tell you why dobbs jumped me yesterday!

we're...not together.
bodega bay? where's that?

i shouldn't tease a hero.

zach, how old are you, son ?
you can't come back. that is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
come aboard.
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
the blintzes!  "try the blintzes..."
you know, sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home. i'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
no thanks, matt. i need my eight hours.
do not swear: although i joy in thee, i have no joy of this contract to-night: it is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; too like the lightning, which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens.' sweet, good night! this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. good night.
i thought it was you - how are you?
forget about me and mom -- are you going to marry him?
finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
what happened?
of course, he's concealed about me person.
...i heard different, thought that was...
oh.
it was on my dad's list of "things to do." but the house did him first.
then why do you still like her?
what's wrong?
...everyone has been very kind.
what's going on?  i'm going on my second job this month, and now i'm going on unemployment.
i declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, willa harper!
that must be raoul!  raoul!  look, d'artagnan's come to visit...! what's wrong?  you look awful!
like testicular cancer?
well i'm sorry. before...
guess who? it's your old friend, lex.
it's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
your shorts are looking especially gold today.
it's working.
did you go to college, mrs. crawford?
yes.
you mustn't let what he said bother you. it was only words.
you sick or what?  you forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
you're going to have a lot of work to do when i get back.
hello.
sweetheart...
continued
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
call them back.
take another look at these two.
is this him!?
you want me to pump?
that's possible. sir august was convinced he'd met me before. but i'd never met him. another odd thing. when it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
where are they?
a new <u>take</u> on the...  well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by monday morning.
that must have been when he got it.
i just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
what are you talking about. how do you know?  i need her!  i need her.  she needs me.  i've got to get to her.
tell me what to do.
yes ... it involves some old and forgotten papers.  things i signed as vice president.  i want the originals in my office and i don't want copies anywhere else.
yeah.  basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  you know?
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic.  turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  they figure we've finally gotten saddam off their backs.  they brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... i'm their new best buddy.  america number one, joe. but there's something the shi'ites can't figure out:  they can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow americans, left me out in the desert.  they can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost.  it's almost as if they were iraqi spies, or something.  and i've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the iraqis.  see how i mean?
you don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
ya caught me in a bad mood.
don't be afraid.  you can tell me.
dat's yo uncle ben.  that reminds me, i've seen a lot of troubles lately.
you murdered her!
so my associate mr. marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
that is correct.  i was engaged to render an opinion.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
no, really.
i don't remember.    i was drunk.
i ain't interested in your life story.
where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
it doesn't bother me.  i'm just not interested.
no officer is going to get these men to fight!  they had the life crushed out of them on long island. at the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect congress.
i don't know. look around man.
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
i know you. this shari is a passing fancy.
continue.
yes?

congratulations on your daring escape. you just missed me by a few seconds.  it's check, peter.

hey marv, he demanded confidentiality...
come on, donny, they were threatening castration!
please - i beg you, i beg you, i beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. just stop, please, and listen to me.  my wife is dying.
if you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. you should learn how to keep a secret.
casey's bouncin' at a bar up harvard. we should go there sometime.
paraffin came up positive. and bullet holes are usually a big clue.
tell him i'm coming!
where's richard and julia?

i wish i could say my interest in you was purely professional...
came to my senses.
stop talking.
stand up, john. let them see you.
oh? i thought you did so every day. so speak now. answer me!
you're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
every year.
you heard me! you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you! go away from here!
and you never heard of rock 'n roll?
the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  and if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
what were you doing?
she drives me nuts.  she's been ragging me all day.
...so you heard from keith? he still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
do men have sex with each other in that theater?
chicken salad.
you're part of my flock now, john. welcome.
please, bill. what happened, it's my fault, i know it.
bert, now listen to me. ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? bert, listen!  it's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
hey!  what did i say?
get her out of the seat, i need room to sit.  harry?
too aggressive?
hey, schulz! i got a deal for you. suppose you help us escape. we'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden. for the world championship! schulz, the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones!
be careful, dude.
i dunno.
no. we will find another way to locate the fortress.
jack crawford is helping your career, isn't he? apparently he likes you. and you like him, too.
good evening, ladies.  you must forgive me, my dearest wife, but i simply could not wait to see you.
i can't even imagine.
on august 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us?  she's giving me crap about being away from peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  what no one seems to realize is that peter isn't there!  he's not there!  and when he is, he isn't!  so, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, george.  i'll stop coming.  but it won't be because of peter.  it'll be because you asked me to stop.  say what you need to say, because i'm not leaving until i hear it.
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
mom?
how's that?
blow yourself, bigmouth.
noooo!!!
hey, isn't that tran vo?
oh, nothin'. i never let on to mama about dell bein' the one. i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? i didn't tell dell, neither. he was back home in chattanooga by then, anyhow, and i didn't see the point. somethin' terrible happened to him, though. six months ago.
when was he... created?
nothing ... it's nothing.  just ... i'm reminded of a song i learned as a child.  a song about pirates.
good point.
just one question.  please.
you know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, stanley....  i'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if i don't, i come home without the money....
isn't it wonderful?  bela lives!
if he could--
how'd the show go?

just wait there for me!
that's what i want ...
they will hold lyssa in the center of the vortex, the place of the beast, where its power is greatest. no man can match it there. lyssa must try to move toward us. for as we enter the vortex and move closer ...

yeah, i've got a girlfriend.
i can see him right now!
what's the point?
when you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
mitch likes it very much. he comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. he says san francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
caen?

it's reply paid.
you're not gonna come back, are you?

i hadn't noticed.  i've seen you around.  what's your name?

casper.
do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy?  please, clayton.  it will be better if i find the body alone.
this is jennifer and nick. they're dear friends of mine.
is that what you call it? "real"?
i know, son.  but you'll like it where we're going.  i'm getting a good job.  it's a pretty part of the country.
yeah i know.  patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  he doesn't want any attention.
please, mister president, i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  here is the only other camera i have left. 
but aren't you the grandson of the famous dr. victor frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?

it's got to be stopped!
the same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
flozen foleva not good.
that's for sure. at the airport - that's where it was. at the airport, there in one of those gift shops... anyway, you better take a break.
tell me.
no way, mayo. you don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? hey, man, i figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my f-14 and sell it to the cubans.
take your time... one day at a time, kid...
your completely missing the point.
do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
you think it's that good?
no-no-no...
...give me protection?
take a break veronica, sit down.
right.
you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.
how's everything, gus?
ac-system 'big-ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
well, why not?  i'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. i'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
it's false sentimentality.
i think we both know who did.  what's so urgent?
why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
when you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
well nothing audible to us.  maybe the lab can pick something up.
pretty.
god. isn't this great? working on the job. got a wheel man. got a safecracker. good friends with mr. henry.
the case is closed. harry. tapert's given us a full confession.  get your ass back to mew york.
you eat like a bird.
i'm sorry, d'amour...
what do you mean?
tell me.
nothing is real until it's perceived.
i'll wait here.
you're living on a sailboat?
he doesn't know you're up there!  just stay right where you are!  call the police!
then tell me what to do.
i accept. now get out.
you're crazy.
some nights. i have dreams. mostly dreams i don't want. i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
yeah, well anyway...i thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  i mean, i think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
you aren't taking me for granted, are you?
i can't make new memories. everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. by the time we finish this conversation i won't remember how it started, and the next time i see you i won't know that i've ever met you before.
well...i should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
jack...don’t even start...
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i don't give a shit. let's get this over with.
that is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
-- no -- marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
i'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
this is samir.  see if you can guess his specialty.
you! by christ, you -- i know you.  yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, i know you. you're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!

you sew very badly.
luke didn't smoke.
robert del rio?
whaddup.  money?
what'd i tell you?
is that it ?
yeah?
you think?
you did.
knights who say "ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  we seek the enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
i figure we'll get along just fine.
my parents are going to come home early tonight.
i really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
they have a right to be...  do you think they'll help us?
you're wasting your time.
i think you'd better go.
yeah, hello.
i'm a grisly sight, it's true; but i love you and that's why i'm here. you've got to know.
are we leaving mommy?
mom!
you sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, god in heaven, did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me? the greatest conductor on earth. i want him out the way. he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music. send him to stalingrad. isn't that what you did? you don't like criticism, do you, wilhelm?  you surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels?
but it's a delay!  how long? a day?  two days?!
so off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i didn't know it or something.  he got angrier and angrier and then:
he came in through the cupboard.
sir henry, mr brown is standing in the courtyard.  i have no wish to go riding.

my wife?
we coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.

what's that mean, no employment certificate?
wait there.
we're alone.
full power, sir.
i feel very emotional right now.  a bit out of control.

i told 'em not to touch the alarm. they touched it. i blew 'em full of holes. if they hadn't done what i told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
if you said yes i would have had a reason.  you should let me redress those bandages.  before you go.
someone worthy of respect, lad.  she be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
get off my property!
no questions.
only brother.
why?
i was napping on the couch.  there was a voice and a shot.  i woke up. ben was looking at me.
charlotte, who?
there's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
yeah!
i don't understand.
just like a ghost ship, huh?
they'll know whether he killed himself.
kennedy -- never.  he'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  but nixon doesn't know that, which is why i'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.

where?
i don't understand.
two cents worth of shoelaces?
watch the show, sid. his basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
delacroix, wake up, brother man. the reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and i mean nobody - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
...you know...
when can i squeeze one out?
positive saliva match.  the cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
our money situation is not good.
...and you're not lost now?
the fuck is wrong with you?
i think we can cut your visit short. leon is not here.
i don't have a pistol.

yes, he is. and someone else. vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.

you're it.
in about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  any questions?

does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?

i just got my license two weeks ago.
so, bill, if i understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?

you want to see...
what kind of mine?
that's a lollipop that, boy.  the kid is only great.
just a few questions?
welcome home eleanor.  welcome home?  i've never been here.  who did this?
if we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
i mean, kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  she'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
she's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
what do we do?
where do you go next?
well, everyone's desperate for a new falkland's angle.  purdy's come up with a real dog.  worker's rights in argentina.  so i've been running round getting people to do things.  but no one's keen.  workers rights.  when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  i said to purdy, "look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
what are you doing?!
where!
yes, that's true, but he refused to give the nazi salute. he kept his baton in his right hand. in hitler's presence. that was a brave act...
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.
of course, there's that to discuss. refill?

no, i can't. you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeat-it's lovebeat," by little tony defranco and the defranco family. i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade.
hey, jim, what's doing? uh-huh... uh- huh... jim, we've been over this. if you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. i don't like him either, but i'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. give my best to denise. bye.
i know, but that's enough.
thanks for the fresh air. that felt good.
that's right. you've captured me exactly. goodnight.
the board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.

the morning after pearl harbor, he drove down to st. louis to reenlist.  he was so damn excited. world war ii was going to be his second chance.  they told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
well, just get it off your chest, son.
i hear that! see, i knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but i wanted to try -- i thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. my son would grow up here. maybe have one or two more. i'd teach 'em what i could. they'd play with my brother's kids. all grow up together. and even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it?

thelma, i'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.

of course you do.  a tuxedo and tails.
what about easier to hit in an air raid?

dad, i'm hoping we can talk about some things while i'm here.
don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in california like we think?
i'd die for her.
yeah, deal. give me the two dollars.

i'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
feeling better?
and, if it's a threat.
all right! listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when i tell you this but - you shouldn't do this..there is no holy grail.
adamant?
yes, but will you honor it?
i just can't believe it. any of it!  look at this room!.. they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  computer?
why?  i don't know.
the carbon-units infection will now be removed from the creator's planet.
we're already past it, aren't we, kevin?
you stand someplace else, man. you stand someplace else. this is our corner. you don't fucking own it!
hey. do you have a cigarette?
looks like we hit pay-dirt. this place is crawling with them.  see the valets over there? they're vampires. so is the doorman.
you know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
very important, garland. i just thought you should know that. whatever happens.
it's the real thunderbolt, then.
i'm thirty.
who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
in the immortal words of derrick coleman, whooopdeedamndoo!!!
that was nancy, not me!
very cosmopolitan.
just a place, i suppose... who knows?
good morning.
nothin'. 
thirty thousand dollars reward.  in the whereabouts of il dottore fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
where's audrey?
do you love her?
things are really rotten at home. you wouldn't believe how rotten. janey's sick. she's unstable, i guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like i can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
let's go.
do you think i'm pretty?
yes?
that's not the point.
...you know.
don't give me your klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
i don't believe this is happening...
it's hard to explain.  something happened today.  it was like a dream.  and when i woke up i had all these new memories. good times.  times we never had before.
please, have a seat.
i read the hospital report on your client.
you got the admissions letter.
thank victoria for dinner.
nothing!  i didn't hurt him.  <u>he</u> bit <u>me</u>!  this is <u>my</u> blood!
it's all over between us, doug, i'm sorry, but that's the truth.  i've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  i'm sorry.  it isn't <u>you</u>, j...
not exactly.
jack!
the human cash register. got her hooks into the schuyler kid, eh?
don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out.
you know what i've been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it's about you.  sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
love ya.
<u>look</u> at him!  i think he's dying!
i did, honey, but that was last night... let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
i don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
you recognize her?
what have you been doing here!  <u>huh</u>! <u>i wanna know</u>!  <u>what have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
you look frightened. have i been saying something frightening?
i thought there might be somebody inside.
and if you think you can fuck me, don't. cause i'm fucking insulated fisher. protected. backed up on floppy. do you get me? i want my fucking money!
well, i wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. but i've only been there about four days. he got a little rough with arlene the other day.
not elizabeth the second, elizabeth the first.  did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh?
what was the use. he was right. there wasn't a thing in the world i could do about it.
continued
go away.
i don't know.
any group pictures in the annual?
ben, i'm a man of god.
uh, v.i.p. security arrangements generally take some time, senator.
that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.
you don't have to do it for a living.
oh really?  we're they `us'es' or `them's'?
blade. once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. he must be destroyed.
you think we're being set up?--christ, deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names.
so, what causes this?
workin'. pickin' peaches. but i seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so i come out to see what's goin' on. what's it all about?
wussup?
we're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. could be a big help in unsolved cases. most of them have been happy to talk to us. they have a compulsion to boast, these people... do you spook easily, starling?
...if i wasn't such a fucking coward.  it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
well, first off, if you were glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
is he awake?
aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can mona lisa?
hello, mr. balboa -- i'm miles jergens -- please, have a seat.
go on, kill me too.  just as you killed my wife.
tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
easy, animal! easy!
almost got me in billings. i saw you there, shooting at me.
i'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
juno? what's going on?
dad --
... i don't think he understands...
does phil know how you guys feel?
you're such a doll. i hate money, don't you? god, it's been fun.
what else did he tell you...
can't tell.  pretty tall.  he's real scrunched up in that thing.
mr. chekov, i've lost the bird of prey. she must have cloaked.
boat five -- wickwire, cozad, vinyl, intagliata, ayers, and wise. lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer.  follow his orders to your death.
all right, say you're right, say you don't get yourself killed. there's something else.  it's too late for virge, he already rolled his bone.  but it's not too late for you, morg.
i leave tomorrow.
yeah, and gradually you get old and die. you know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
they're stragglin'.
i was in luh-love with her.
that's an insult, i got a vow of poverty.
i got them to remove the reflection.  the mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
you'd have to die first.  aqui.
yes.  that's my case.  now it's yours. all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. decapitated.  brains extracted.  limbs torn to shreds.  it looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
you got the extender?
i'll think you'll find everything in working order. molly's just having a little fun.
what happened, darling.  we were so worried.  i was going to take a sleeping pill, but i wouldn't till i knew you were home.
and why would she do that?
either one.
nope.
if i thought i could get away with it -
here's the plan.  you gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for mr. william jones.
how the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
what is this, david?
winded, old timer?
you've never been sick?
i hope we will, too.
we talked. he wanted to get a bite -- after. i said no.
i made a great reporter out of you, hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. you need me and i need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
i'm getting clear of this. if you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. gordo?
don't be an ass, auggie. he's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
mr. swayzak! how ya doin'?
this way ...
maybe i'm just fucking curious.
all right, why?
sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at herald square. look, i make this trip all the time.
five hours.  we both just know.  do you think i deserve to wear white?
no, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. but they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb mexicans living by a dam. now beat it, gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
and if it's unsuccessful?
what happened?--was meurice there?
which means --
no.
there could be problems with something like that mister wallace. what if...?
was his wife ever a suspect?
i can't help you if you don't help yourself.  it's really up to you. brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
he only had a hundred an' thirty. -- i think he's good for the rest next week, mr. gazzo.
what are they gonna do to us?
can you tell me what happened?
or perhaps into a new one.  but here's to your god and the courage of our legions...
you mean that...  i-i-i-i flew three thousand miles to see you.
i wouldn't take that too seriously.
then what do they have?
you want me to fuck you? is that it? okay, come here. take your clothes off. get into bed.
you know, i don't know this town any more. all this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  where have the years gone, daddy? where is the little town i knew as a boy?
uh-huh.
that’s my car!  you stole my car!
hold this. 
now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. get a firm grip, ma!
jerry! blackie! queenie! let's have it quiet, fellows!
and in fact he met privately with the president, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
aren't these lovebirds?
you're going home.  i'm sending a radio call for the boats.  we'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
shut up, kevin.
okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?
poison?  i'm surprised at you.  you lack vision, mr. o'brien.
alright, we're gonna carry you...
the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
that's cute, kathryn.  real cute.
we've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. along with all his research. uh, we received a cable from his colleague, doctor schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  i want you to pick up the trail where he left off. find the man and you will find the grail.
it's alright.
i think it's absolutely charming.
a what?
man, this here newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
sir, i wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
but you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  you're very responsible with ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
i'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
don' be facety, woman.
i mean, that's what it's like.
maestro.
you mean to tell me we're dead!
thank you.  aren't you a sweetheart?
of course i don't want you to bring it up to him... but if it comes up...
hold me. i'm falling!
that's where you live.
i don't like animals.  never have. dog bit me when i was little.  after that i gave up on pets.  animals are irrational.  give me a psychotic killer any day.  if there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  my first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  it was late august.  over ninety.  the polar bear was inside his cave.  kids didn't know he was in there.  all they saw was the pool. they got to swimming and splashing. the noise woke up the bear.  by the time i arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. i can still hear the mother screaming --
where in mexico would you like--
let me try this, goddamnit! she's been doing it all week, she can do it now!
he's inherited a fortune.
why don't you leave this town - go home?
---and a snake-eye glare, arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had.
quittin' time, gus. comin'?
and... uh-
which one?
death.
nice work.
this is horseshit.
i'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
glass, what is it?
wait!  wait!  there's something i forgot to tell you.
what's wrong?
if my universe had a hub...
do you feel alone right now?
where've you been?
tool? tool for what? we've been going together almost two years!
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea. very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
well, of course not.  my goodness, what a fuss you're making.  well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
it's the latest thing, mrs. peel.
i was trying to pay you a compliment, i was guising it as science 'cause i know you're comfortable in that arena. science.
so, what brings you out here?  pleasure cruise?
where'd they go?
my father said i should've gotten a lawyer --!
okay. why this denny's?
what monster?
your friend's all business.
there. oh, i like the feel of soil, don't you? and the smell. it's the earth. "the earth is my body. my head is in the stars."  who said that?
we'll get through this, i promise. i'll make it up to you --
maybe that's the problem.  i want... a family, ellie.  i want kids.  a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid.  a real life.  maybe that makes me a sellout but i don't care anymore. it's what i want.
it's true.
if i'm sleeping with him, and i haven't said i am, then so what?
is that the way it was with you?
"love your enemies"...
no... i'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them alright?
club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
a chinese man discovered electricity.
he offered you money?
what about mitch? didn't he have anything to say about this?
come here.
pearl! you ain't --
what's wrong, norman?
that is the truth!
are you asking me if i’m gay for pay?
hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
phil, he's not looking inside.  he's just striking out at the world.
ed, come on. what's that gonna do? you're gonna bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it's called "get your shit together before it's too late."
let up on the brake!
josie, i think we should go public.
yes.  except when you creep around in your mother's --
why? why would she?
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes!
now that you mention it...
did you straighten her out?
cole, listen to me... i've got to tell you...
i'm leaving! i...am...leaving!
are you kidding, they love me.  i'm a star, lee.  a god to these people!
he says their medicine is that much more advanced.  he was very nice about it. but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
you know the story, gale. man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. want the exclusive?
mr. scott, how soon can we get underway?
if i can survive rush hour, i figure i can handle grizzlies...
this is just an informal discussion.
my name is li mu bai.  the green destiny is mine.  jade fox can't be your master.  where did you learn that "xuan piu" move?
well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. which i am, and you want to be. know what i mean?
well, what do you think?
you must be going somewhere.
why are you doing this to me, jack?
...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think i'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
no, i mean ricky. he's not interested in any of this stuff.
this isn't happening...
we need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  hi.
it's okay, eugene.
even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! it's 1992, rowan!
very.
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day. my niece, she's cured up, and i got you to thank.
he's climbing the rope. and he's gaining on us.
what if he's busy tonight?
i know.
your earrings?
track their weapons fire.
i own the property, my mother owns the property, i put her into it. i'm going to show you on the plats. you look when you get home a-3 through a-14 and 26 through 30. you take your time and if you still feel.
...what?
let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
we've driven a long way. where is this place?
did you get married real young?
well -- maybe. let's see what happens here.
mr. gower, do you want something . . . anything?
maybe i can change him.
ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
what exactly is it supposed to do?
my daddy lets me sit on his lap.
please don't. don't, rick. i can understand how you feel.
you haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  we're stopping.  we've stopped.
damned hunters.  it was a trap, and you were the bait!
why?
correct!  good night.
are we on schedule? the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
you want... a free one.
you coming to south america?
we're able to surprise each other.
yes - i'm sorry ellen...
... he lied to us.  he left us down here.
then i put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. he gets his jollies off.
george sanders?
come dance.
many times.
that isn't true, is it?
cocky little bastard. i hope he was a baddy.
it's all right, jabez. we'll find something to pay stevens.
you are, and it's behind you.
he's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
what do you want with my baby?
my people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. in fact, it's our prime directive.
you wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
abc...?
what're you talkin' about? that's your son in there.
couple?  no, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
they're a bit too real for my taste. will you excuse me for a moment?
what are you drinking?
good morning.
soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
make a hole, billy-boy.
i'll get the book.
jake, you need to rest.
i called your god-damned office! i want you to kill him, harry. you'll do that for me, won't you? i loved him, i loved him... that bastard.
this is my house.
'cause you like their second one, you said, pop, girls. etc.  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover.  you didn't see the cover though.
i don't look my age, joe.
oh, i didn't know that.
you have to be a hero. all americans think they are cowboys.
-- nicola!  how was your massage?
no -- letters to two-eighty.
town records are coming up now.
ah, edna, come in. join the tea set.
dr. maxwell is right, mother.
then, i'll sail alone.
did you read today's paper?
are you coming to my party?
oh.  well.  good.
what is it?
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
you really love flashing that thing, don't you?
valentine...
what happens then?
so... pretty nice house you've got here.
but how can i win? adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
...i'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. did you enjoy your mother's visit?
i got an overcoat on.
this is its current position.
i can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me jack.
he taken the lord's name in vain and he trampled on his holy book!
not me.  i'm not special.  i'm not exceptional.  this is, though.  what i'm doing.
no.
why do you want to speak to him?
hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, baxter?
stop it. this is just sad.
rollo, you know me. once a gp, always a gp.
a toast to whatever he just said.
of course.  he's a "de-gene-erate".  he works at gattaca.  why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
kiss my ass.
you will.  look, nuke--these big league hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  that's the secret.  you gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
it's not your province to ask.
kit give me nothin'.
are you tired of it?
where could you take them?
nah...  with you, i mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
i know.
lucy and i kept talking, and i didn't realize how late it had gotten.
... you know, and i know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there...
hey now, what is this?
very futuristic.  yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
mine, mine.
you said you were leaving town.
good morning, gentlemen.  i'm mr. daniels, the manager.  i believe i've spoken to one of you on the phone.
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by rose's wishes, although i am sure they are identical. let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
i was wondering.
so, then, you're, like, available?
what?
he's trying to sink us!
nick's going?
pike and i got separated --
no, sir. this is my own idea.
i gotta go.
we'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
you said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
back at the door -- i asked you to back away.
i'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
inspector.
thank ...you.
don't you think he's using you?
who is he, joe?  i've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
i heard he was the best.
i say, to most people it's a washout.
i was born just two blocks from this studio.  right on lemon grove avenue.  father was head elec- trician here till he died.  mother still works in wardrobe.
i float.  you sink.  end of story.
i must be destroyed.
only three shocks. a chimp takes fifteen. this is going to be tres simple, no, gabrielle?
twelve hundred years ago.
that's not the question. it's over.  do you think that it's my fault? if i'd... if i'd... i never should have taken it. there was no way that i was going to win.
no, before my time.
i'm giving him his ring back.
the 2-3.  homicide.
i want my kid out of protective custody. now.  no fucking around.  my wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  i sign when they call me safe and sound.
give us your money man.
oh, here you are, jabez. lan's, i was worried about you.... hail in august! the crops will be ruined!
i was worried about you.
wait, eve, please!  wait.
right.  that gives us...
right. now i remember.
the rain is letting up.
do you miss it?
know what else is in here?
i just wish you could have heard her.
i was in hell. i've been there. it's horrible. i don't want to die, louis.
i need to tell you something.  i didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. that you haven't lived and loved enough. i didn't understand.  forgive me.
besides, i don't even know if i want to write anymore.
what did he say?
well, then, doctor macfarlane -- although i've known a time, toddy, when you liked the name.  aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  but come toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
a lot?
i'm gonna nail it.
you've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
it might have been her mother.
i...
joe.
what's that?
i'm not. believe me. <u>i'm</u> scum.
okay.
you wanna get caught spying on albert?
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
we went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  but you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
i guess i never told you i'm afraid of heights.
a yawp?
no, i'm concerned with everything.
why?
after all, mr. roundy, we're paying six percent. six percent. fha's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
105-353.
no, don't let her!  i'll... how about peg? robbie?
what did you say?
mr disraeli.  ma'am.
not here.
how you figure?
i almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  tell me, tell me, radio raheem, to turn my music down. didn't even say please.  who the fuck he think he is?  don corleone and shit.
"but you won't..."
let's roll.  we got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to doucet. 0800 this morning.
let me go!
jesus!  can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
jesus god...
could you have your partner wait for us outside?
no.
earth ii.
it wasn't hard.
what -- what are you doing?
1961?  '62?  mary clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  it's the last secular music we recall.
what do you want me to do?
shelly's sick...i have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
don't hurt me!  don't hurt me!
why pick on him ?
relax.  j. edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
bet you're pretty handy around the house... can you cook?
how the hell did you do that?
i've run on. forgive me. we're here to talk about you.
how long have you been up?
what is it, gilbert? tell mother! what did he say?
hey, pony.
i mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
did you hear that mr. de santis? everyone's really crazy about dead cat.
okay.  where to begin?  with your constant absenteeism?  with your unpresentable appearance?  you're up for review...
i hope i'm not being too forward.
we sought only your infinite wisdom.
have you done something to your hair?
hello? yeah, baxter. what's up?
ayuh...how is your cat, louis?
sixty...  oh.
i don't know.
miss ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? she's comin' down from portland.
so you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
bela, are you ready?
yah, ya know it's the radisson, so it's pretty good.
it means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
that's him.  he's a lot prettier in person though.
this certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  how could you have left such a beautiful place, bobby?
you are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
that's ridiculous.
he wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. he thinks i'm mad because i laughed at him.  he's indian, he wears a turban.
it's stupid, of course.
they should just be looking harder.
oh, umm, yes, this is dwight campbell.
i must talk to my brothers!
yes, sir. i suppose you might call it that, sir.
i've never seen a dead body before.
i killed too many barbarians.
hey, barry.
stop. everyone is looking.
well, what it was... i, i don't want to admit it, but, you know, i was jealous of pony.
why are we leaving?
how?
after three years she remembers what the guy drove?
were you recently in the bathroom?
well, why should i put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
fuck, no! why would i care about something as dumb as that?
"raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, hoover blackballed their memory. look at ness.
no.
earth... but when?... spock?
don't turn us out, abbe.
so what are you gonna do tonight, marty?
yes, you do...  anyway, tonight was a good start.
you'll have to excuse me. i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes.
what time is it?
it's still my money. if you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
i'll buy ya the best dinner in san francisco...how'd that be? then we'll go dancin', okay?
you're not english.
yes, i do.
and who is she?
so, human... you've met your better self!
and the light goes out...
i was trying to be smooth.  but at twelve-fifteen i was gonna come over there and talk to you.
scooby, don't! be careful!
that's right.
it's-
it was bo, sir te's man.  i hear he followed the thief to the yus'.
the last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
what kind of words?
what's up with you? bladder infection?
hey, i was just trying to ...
what?! that is not allowed. my god, you are supposed to be one of us. you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself!
what about him?
did she have a weapon in her hand?
wanted to say goodbye to him...
like a home, for one thing.
yah.
sergeant, i'm a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
what's his name?
honza says they'll print an open letter to president havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
it's sarah.
uh, no.
stupid.
yes!
that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie, illinois.
hey, great they're back.
get him the hell over to amity point, the old lighthouse.  right now.
<i>you drove lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the dmv. why?</i>
i was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
oh, buddy, that's so romantic.
morpheus...
fine. i'll put it on my room. okay?
split it?
maybe that's why you can't catch him.  i <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
that sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on easter day.
i...i don't know what i did...
when would agnes have conceived the child?
is there an antidote?
oh, god.
after dinner, if hanna isn't back? can we try a few more sketches?
personally, i think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. dickson's all right.
now hurry, hurry.  i will watch!  your desires may be my pleasure also...our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  you must...hurry now.
are you expected?
i can't hear this now --
is there another way?
i am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  will you look after tim, lex?
get your hands off of her.
that's it.  just do it, all right?
look at you!
this is it? i can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
i want to be a teacher.
did you love it?
adrian -- you?  you killed blake, and --
mummy and i, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  then a couple of years after daddy died, and not long after i left oxford, she started seeing various men and i was furious.  i really was upset. i stopped going home.  i never phoned.  i went round telling everyone how awful her books were. and she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  then i got a job i was interested in, and i started to see lots of men, and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand.  so i wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry i was, and how i was worried that we were drifting apart.  and do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
we have clearance, clarence.
sure.
hello, officer.  is there a problem?
yeah.
so you're just going to give up and go home?
they let you out?
first offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  the piggy bank.
was a member of...?  speak up?
that's the guy.
yep.  tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
who's phone?
did your voice tell you to jump?
how soon --
i think you're jealous that i'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
mommy i'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i'll pop but... but if i stay little it won't happen.
you know alfred.  he'd never say anything.  but i can tell.  until you came along, alfred was the only family i ever had.  without him, i don't know how i would have survived.  he saved my life, dick.  and i've never told him.
i’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
shut up! shut the fuck up!
i uh... i had lunch in town today. happened to cross paths with "that redfield woman." i apologize. i thought you were half-joking about that.
what was that?
...comes up that road.
hey.  this is my business.  do i tell you your business.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  but...do you see?
well you're not reading it right!
there's seven ashtrays in this room, duffy.
dave...
that's mighty brave of you, reverend.
where?
this isn't random or light. someone made amistake...!
no, i'm not.  maybe you know him. glenn michaels?
mr. fairlane, i'm very rich.  the kind of rich that warps minds. nothing offends me.  when i was eleven, i walked in on my father and the shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. does that excite you?
this looks pretty good on me.
so what's going on?
oh, paul--
no!
you mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
the country boy's about due.
wow.  that's more than a dress. that's an audrey hepburn movie.
... i don't get it done often.
yes. i do.
they are dead.  in either case --
hey.
got any more, ma?
pike never confessed.
how did you meet him?
no.  no way.  i wouldn't even know where to begin!  those thoughts about my cousin elena -- they were just thoughts. i would never --
you better be keeping your mind on business. it's not just me you got to worry about. i've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
no. don't worry, i'm a cop. everything'll be okay. is he still breathing?
does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the soviets?
christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. showing me the ropes. and that's something, considering how long it took him to get over i'm not armenian. so i'm thinking about it. but i don't know, might get a little incestuous. but mike does pretty well. a lot of high-end commercial stuff.
just say what you have to say, woman. what other people think shouldn't matter to you.
how do they know that, you told them?
off the scale.
before we go through with this, i just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
no, that's not what i'm saying. i'm saying i don't need a limousine to know who i am, alright?
if you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what i'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
hi.  i closed a sale today, without len.  that's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
dr. sutphin said no sweets for you.
wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
mom, michael won't talk to me.
then who did?!
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace.
it's not your given name, right?
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata, all by himself.  he was afraid of catching cold.
i can't tell you.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
make a blind here?  wait for the buck to return?
you've been in this house for a while?
diane, i've loved you ever since i first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
here's to. an interesting experience.
what are you doing?
he's screaming his opinions in my ear.
what a shame!
will he yield for a question?
shall we go?
now, aim --
no!
know what?
you're talking about the woman i love.
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. i wasn't lucky.
it's about the director.
you don't look thirty-five.
richardson won't do that.  he'll resign.
you had to be a right-hander.
wait a minute. the man was fired for incompetence, not because he has aids. you didn't know he was sick, did you, bob?
uh, yes i, like, do... it's simple. you make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. you press the cd's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
ray's with the f.b.i. task force, working on the prison break.
by the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
would that be a problem?
hey, you could call me "bernie," forget the "mister laplante" stuff.  you are naive.
hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
thanks.
might i ask why?
how?
how are we doing?
come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
i'm sorry about the other day. i don't know what's wrong with me... i really do want to move in with you.
i don't hate you.  i need your help.
iíve taken the liberty and had inspector thompsonís office searched, as i believe you instructed.  all clear now, sir.  they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... poor man.
you did this for me?
what is that, mahogany? what happens if you crack the neck?
now, try a running guy.
i did what you told me to.
this is all a mistake. jack, please take that mask off.
she wants it to come.
i need to rent a cabin.
eh, ringo, do you know what happened to me?
doing what?
what? what do you mean?
when he first came in to the sleep lab?
gerron.
stretch it out.
what's that?
i was being polite.
hey, rene.
parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. it's the twentieth century.
he's right. you'd feel much better about it.
gasparilla?
not that it matters.  this is the morgue?
goin' where?
you got it.
i was told you were in a fight.
sit down here.
eh.
happy anniversary, mrs. gooding.
... luke, you must not go.
he won't.
your man is the drummer, peter criss, right?
really?
burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
is she all right?
i think he means the kennedy assassination.
we'll send for the police!
we're here to say, your government was right.
grow up. you don't kill people like me. people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why? because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...
what about the others?
oh, god, dj, what do i... how do i...
started what?
just one. the back up.
everybody knows freddie miles.
yeah. i guess we did.
this saturday.  quintana and--
jerry's on vacation 'till monday. i can give him the message when he gets back. that was patrick and the last name--
that's when it happened?
you're there in thirty minutes or i find you, jerry, and i shoot you, and i shoot your fucking wife, and i shoot all your little fucking children, and i shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. got it?
not exactly a big ocean country.
what can i get for you tonight.
okay, here's what i want.  i know about this stuff.  a five-star hotel.  with room service.
you're out of your mind.
the great bill parrish at a loss for words?  the man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
isn't that your number?
catherine tramell.
have no fear.  it will come out well for me.
i don't think miss daniels is going to sue anybody.
how charming.  but why did he not come himself?
what's she doing here?
will you give mom a break?
why you talking to me?
some folks take that natural stuff too far.
tony? this is keith fisher. you're doing my wedding and i'm calling about the chair situation. yeah, i'll hold.
the lamplight.  that's all.
you mustn't see her, my lord.  we know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from lorraine.
what...is...it?
why?
well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  i'm not worried.  you shouldn't be worried.
let me ask you this: when you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
source?  what about derek?
i'm sure i wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
i love you too honey.
er ... but i would've found out anyway.
good evening, miss.
yes, stop!  i wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  what's wrong?
did you hear that?
you said you could keep up with her! 'no problem, nick-san.'
four
don't even think about it. rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending princeton this fall. she's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
that is correct, comrade skrapinov. we have ascertained that gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the american government.
decorated?
what is it?
then what is it?
mister mcmurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. however, the cardinal rule, and i must emphasize this: everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
you shouldn't smoke.
son of a bitch!
i'm going to put on an officer named will maddox.  you talk to him for a while.
i'm not sure you answered my question.
mrs. williams? thanks for the cake.
all the professionals keep them in the trunk.
rod... i have to get back to my job.
who the hell made up that law?!
excuse me, charles. with all due respect... this is... preposterous! it doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. pardon the lack of humility, but i've had the distinct impression i was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. and i feel that wasn't just my imagination. and i also think i deserve to know what's really going on here, charles.
that doesn't bother me.
that's me. 
well tell 'em, honey.
you were right. he found me.
i didn't think so. so, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
you buy this "blurry" business?
asbestos lining.
i like that one.
wife around?
i told you the questions might get a little personal --
i think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
i'm looking for moses seradungu's room.
oh, no you don't!
are you playing a trick on me?
you went through edmunds' things?
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
where is inner space?
your shot.
hey caitlin...  break his heart again this time, and i'll kill you. nothing personal.
you're a... you're sick.
we may have a chance.
couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
so he was indicted?
good morning, fraulein schlumberg.
maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
man eater!!!
i know tom grunemann.
what are you going to do?
so, where are you from?
come on, you guys.
and i am m'sieu laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
you're not driving jess no more. two strikes, bobby, and this last one was big. the bachelor's father goes to my schul.
would you like to sit on my lap?
and that's the best part.  "teacher-student relations: how close is too close?" we're gonna blow the lid off it!
sure i can't twist your arm?
and what's the mysterious code word?
hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
kurt doesn't look too good.
do you want to get some coffee?
really? do you want them to overrun all new york colony?
oh! in that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. trying to blackjack --
what if i reached a point where you didn't think i was crazy anymore?  if i was normal.
that's not the reason i'm here.  i swear it.
when all this is over and we're not working for maxie, i'd love to run into you on the street.  why aren't you coming?
oh, you assume, do ya? what do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
we didn't tell her anything yet. we thought that we'd leave it to you. we thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. do you want tommy and me to stay here with you?
if you must know, yes. i don't know what to do. i can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, i'm completely infatuated with her.  she made me laugh.
oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
most dangerous thing in the world: a regular joe, in over his head.  you trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
let us settle this tomorrow.
you gotta give tee one thing. he's good with the ladies.
harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. this bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
picked them up from the printers yesterday
who will?
enrique! quienes son estos? how could you bring them here?
elsa! elsa, don't move!
what's with the cameras?
i don't know.
i accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *i'll* tell you why we were in tht room. because mr. taylor, a respected citizen of our state, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
are you and hannah seeing each other, james?
jimmy!  that's why the court exists.  the court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  but to give them a chance at justice.
status?
yes.
he'll never make it!  they're gonna get him!
elvis i like, too.
those cowboys're tellin' everybody in town they're gonna clean you out.  they're down in that lot right now behind the ok corral.
he's a great poet.
we gotta whole pot inna kitchen. we give you a plate-a your own.
i see. i'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
yeah, bullshit.  watch us.
i hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
i don't know any rwandans.
he's your cousin?
i think it's safe to get out now.
nine years?
uh-huh.
i know what it sounds like.
oh, the whole family loved him. of course, they loved the last guy i went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
if you so much as breathe heavy on them, i'm out on strike.
did bobby give you that or is there someone new?
all this time... i was a lost secret.  but you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  you were the man in the iron mask.
feed the dogs.
another unknown. not on the charts. a red dwarf.
i see...
i apologize for that scene with my husband.  you must have overheard.
come on.
oh...
yes.
no one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
does that worry you?
yeah, it's a simple piece. if they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
i can handle it.
we're leaving, don't try and stop us.
you never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics? he's just a boyfriend, dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio, i'm about to become single again.  and yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which i'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. you ask me who i choose, i choose you.
i bet.  going into people's homes.
i'm sorry to be upsetting you, david, but i had to come.
don't know--just that she was afraid--
mulvaney...
oh, not at all, i let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
shoot it.
andy!
if all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
i know who he is.
oh. i thought you wanted me to stick around.
okeh, i was wrong. but you can't expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. you've been sorta close mouthed about him.
did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?
-- how we doing?
ready?
so tell me, how's it going?
<u>now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
that's curious.  i was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
we're running out of time, sir.
the way you drove that car, i figured you for the streets.
for pete's sake, calvin!  we've got guests!
yeah. you. every time i see you. no more errol flynn, okay? your back won't take it. you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
you're not helping.
who was that on the phone?
i suppose you feel better now, sir.
hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
how would you like to go tonight?
try me.
did you know the contractor?
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick.
who is she?
captain, i implore you. the men are frightened and angry. they want your assurance.
better?
frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
sounds good to me.
no...what?
can i finish? hello? can i finish? ...the united states has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? cops? and car crashes caught on tape? we can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
exception!
morning.
you need to call your dad.
i got no music!
oh yeah? we're just over in buellton. windmill inn.
because he's forced out at third! it's a force!
we will. there's something i've got to find out.
continued
but it's so sad. so terribly sad. i'm not used to it, i'm not ready for it... you know... i have never been so upset in my life. sandro, why don't you help me?
<u>i</u> dunno.... ambassador to <u>togo</u>, somethin', <u>i</u> dunno... he...
well. this is... surprising. does walter...?
is there anything wrong?
you're late.
now let's keep going here.
it's not.
i'd rather sing than do anything!
forty-eight hours, old man.  but if you cross me, i won't feel any guilt about what i do to you.
there goes mother.
nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  go after the people that knew kane well.  that manager of his - the little guy, bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  i don't mean go through the city directory, of course -
leave me alone, jude.
fighting’s a part of it, annie.  you know that, right?
you forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
do you like talk like that?
there's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, frank.
i'm curious.
so what's the problem?
so did this one. wambli is a rare and sacred creature. when someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. we share everything. a lot of power in the eagle feathers. but you think that's bullshit too, don't --
not at all.  they could be carried.
alice? the others show up?
with a jacked-up attitude.
bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. found him in an old boiler room, just like before. saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
are you ready for me?
what is the truth?
we worked together on the inside. you were on my programming team --
that's a reasonable assumption.
what are you afraid will happen?
yeah, my poor baby. it's his daddy's fault. i mean earl was a good man... i mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
i should have told him.
six twenty-seven in the morning... but the money?
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
mrs. lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
masseria's been after me too.
way to go, alfie!  how many people did you break that thing in front of.   good help's hard to find.
juliet!
no...no, no.
what happened? that needle sank like a rock.
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power?
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
why?
who's everyone?
why is junior's watch in that coffin? something stinks around here.
are you outside? a beat and then caravaggio shuffles in.  like an old boxer.
the way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
good. we'll make it oral for now. meet me at rockefeller center at six tonight.
got to see pop, uncle billy.
you must come in first place to move on !
they look nice.
i'm not real big on collecting banged up ferraris at airports.
i don't know what to tell you, skip.
yes.
need any help with those bags, ma'am?
i'm wally brown. your aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
good.  now there is a window.  open it.
in every exhibition room.  the museum's divided into five cells. the reception and exhibit are in cell five.  we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
myra followed you, huh?
nope.
a nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
i'm real excited about working for you mr. matthews...
what do you mean?
what were you talking about?
just a little.  who knows what we're going to find in there.  it could be a huge excavation.  a little friendly pr never hurt.
thank you, sir.  if they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
not another bill?
he's giving them a run for their money.  says here they've got two hueys from danang.  i didn't know those dinks had hueys.
what is that thing? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk!?.'
oh!!
oh, i don't know. i think so. i'll go look.
veronica! j.d. told me you committed suicide last night!
maybe what --
yes.
something wrong with that?
five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
at least you handle the boat all right. stop. here... cut the engine.
roma.
i can't say i blame them. we're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
right, twelve years.  couple times a month.
really.
tell him you want to see him?
i know honey. just remember what i said, we'll bide our time. you just steer clear of him as much as you can. doyle's had a real hard life. it's just about run him crazy i think.
yeah? nicky, i want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
well, how come i laid nine?
yeah.
takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... for a while anyway.
napoleon was born at ajaccio in corsica on august 15th, 1769.  he had not been a healthy baby and his mother, letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  in middle age, he would write about her from st. helena.
all summer?
so you were happy here. warm and cozy and in no hurry...  soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  find me some glass.
i lost him.
every day.  she makes the bed.
why not?
is this some sort of zen thing?
an ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  i'll tell you what happened to my arm.  i'll tell you what happened.  twelve years ago, god looked down on me and said, "cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. first of all, i'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then i'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then i'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. but you, cyrus, i'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. and just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, i'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. if i wanted to, i could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but i'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. every time you look at your hook, i want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. let that be a lesson to you, cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
oww!  why'd you do that?
what did you expect? frankie still has a good string, three girls. figure three hundred a week from each.
you tell me.
you have your passport?
me? why would he be interested in me?
yeah!
i thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
i don't know.
never mind...your pa know you're out here?
<u>oh</u>...  no, no, i'm not angry i'm not, i'm just thrown, i'm...  i actually have an early lunch, so...
oh, buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! they're gonna cut my stummick all open, i'll die!
he might tell me about julia.  the part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  who wants to be redeemed.
he's seat of the pants... completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. all over the sky. but i don't know, skip, he's really got something.
i only get one today? gee, how exciting.
she works for tips!
we could have been killed!  but you saved me!  thank you, mary clarence!
hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
i'm sorry. i had to work late last night. slept at the club.
i know why you're so secretive. why you won't let anybody near you.  i know what he did to you.
you should practice lying more often. you're awful at it.  where to?
affirmative, admiral.
what are you doing in new york...?
immediate roll.  acquire subject at k street and key bridge.					* vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  you have six minutes.
what would you do?
laurie --
yes, he knew.  just..
- so i watched europe. once you showed up in england..it was easy.
meda.  meda.
what's so funny about that?
i'm somewhat less so. we seem to have a bit of a problem...
you're a man of science; i'm a man of god. charenton stands to profit from us both, i'm certain.
what is it?
of course! you want out?
will you do me a favor? stop talking about the good old days.
if you really want to do this... plan it out.  rest up.  train for it.  build up your body.  plan every stop along the way.  how much money?  time?  really do it properly.  this is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
that was a cheap shot!
i need to know what you know. i am no longer a child.
no ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
you get life for kidnapping.
it's safe.
yeah, it's just a coincidence.
get out of here, ray --
quite a collection.
he's got one!
full name.
i wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
jack.  did you compose that yourself?
no. but i don't think that matters.
how much you gonna take?
you feel nothing?
hey, mister.
i just wanted to be sure you were o.k.
do you, mr. leland?
we don't need an act two.
anybody ever call you "red"?
hey, you were never going to give me the money.
there is no escape.  you must join me or die.  don't make me destroy you here ... the emperor is strong with the force.  but if you join me, together we could overthrow him.  do not resist. it is our destiny!
...i guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
if you ask me... i'll say, "yes."
like a hand?
who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
these laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
no spare.
you harlin?
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters, ray. i don't know about uranium, i don't know about red dog table -- all i know is we did our job. it's over.
you think my sister is there?
only to see.
yeah.
and where do you lead, boy?
ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
ah. fine.  it's good.  it's great.
...now, let me get this straight. two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
oh, shit! i hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. if so, i apolog
maybe it isn't going to sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
mary clarence!  you're so... different from the other sisters.  sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
wow...you clean up nice.
ah yes, a music lover.
i don't know!
because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
you're more than that, luther.  they were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  they want you back in.
there, master fettes.  sooner than we had expected.  a stoke of luck one might say.
i baked you my oatmeal cookies.
it's all right -- you're my guest.
and this so-called . . . nuclear man. . . of yours can defeat superman?
insurance!
up north.
what???
another kind of game?
this is so unfair.
there was a result to what you did. it wasn't just another expedition.  it did this.  if the british hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died.
don't test me, i'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
what about your knocking off for lunch?
have they done blood tests on him?
okay, christy -- strip.
can i help you, sir?
uh... i think there's some root beer...
my firm'll represent you. free of charge.
here they come.
to buy lingerie.
stop the car!  now!!
he can tell you're an animal nut. you are, aren't ya?
scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. if there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
listen, asshole...
--it was fine the way it was--
how can you? i mean they're people.
no, i didn't.  i said, "will it change my life," alvy.
oh, of course!!  there's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: the secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
we gotta be inconspicuous.  do you know what that means?
yeah?
what's tomorrow?
very official.  259-7881, if i recall.
hi, peggy. god, that walter getz	can still dance.
that's a shame. i'll send the key right down. and about your promotion --  -- i'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr. sheldrake, in personnel. i wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
you know what my goal is? before i die i want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
it was easy money. i did it in the can.  shit! i learned the junk business in the can, paulie.
... and when i realized our area's just as bad as hinkley, i thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  so i went and asked.
excuse me?
you're right sure you want to <u>jump</u> 'em, ethan?
yah. but it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. i give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
no, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. i took care of it, dennis.
you're so good to me. truly. thank you.
harp, let me tell you something.  i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?
and the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... i can't <u>stand</u> that shit. now i'm being totally honest with you.
oh.
those flowers are too high. won't be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
mr. mulder.
this outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
you alright?  y'okay?
you do that?
do you know hans hinkel?
johnny, the doctors explained --
i need your help, master.  i'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  he's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
no you won't.
why are you working today?
that'd be nice.
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked, really hooked. but you let him off.
hey —— i'm over here.
hear you roar ...
vincent <u>farrell</u>, assistant u.s. attorney.  a passenger in this taxicab, and i'm reporting you to the dmv...
no no, the wealth was all mother's.
alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. take notes if you want to.
we are so fucked.
oh, westley, will you ever forgive me?
it saw us!
it's y. o. h.
it's better than springtime.
what kind of person is that?
you don't know how pleased he'll be.
i think i've really fucked up.  i think i've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  why didn't we just go straight to the police.
what you say your name was?
well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. all walks of life: george best, for example, had it and lost it, or david bowie, or lou reed -
it's okay.
reverse-darwinism. survival of the most idiotic.
what are you saying?  i'm standing here as real as you.
what are you talking about? what kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
no, sorry.
actually, it's been about three hours. you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
i think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
what do you mean?
you sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
no, ben.
i'm a cybernetic organism.  living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
ta da! pantyhose! the death of the garter belt! of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. what do you think?
come on, will...
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
i'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
it isn't.  i've just seen the early edition.
i'm sorry. i can't do it.
-- well it was very hot so i'd left the door open and the water was running so i didn't hear him come down the stairs...
i wanted to give it to you first.
okay.  you want a story?  here's a story.  stifler finds this beer, right?  and...
excuse me miss?
they're all gone--or dead.
i'll take you over, and i'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then i'll cut out. because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and i'll pay you five bucks.
just like i did the hat. have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
why didn't i listen to my mother ...why'd i have to go looking for trouble? any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
wait a minute.  this is the woman i love.  what's going on? who was loaded?
don't defend that horse's ass to me.
we were thinking of putting in a pool.
no. he wants him back. he'll be by tomorrow.
"with a hack-hack here --"
here's hubley.  left quarantine on november thirtieth, relocated first to riverside, then moved to los angeles early in february the following year.  field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
yeah, we’re trying to send a message to hollywood. i’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. it’s just not reality. in the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  you can't even tell me what it is! i ask you for options you give me bullshit. give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
well, a gal a day is enough for me. i couldn't handle any more.
that's not a helpful answer.
i'm not out of shape!
no, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
i can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
in the middle of it, she calls me brad.
i hope she's all right.  how much more do i have to do of this?
franz, trust me.  i promise i won't let you down.
you've made your point.
joel, come here. please.
very good indeed.
and if i get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
they look nice.
i'm saying no--and thank you.
who?
don't please... i'll do what you desire...
jesus christ.  can you kill it?
don't you find that restful?... why didn't you come last night?
to your health, frank.
didn't kill anything, did i?
he knows it well.
i say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
he thought she was great, mr. thompson. he really believed that.  he put all his ambition on that girl.  after she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  oh, i don't blame susie -
everyone... please give domino her space. step back, please!
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
it's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
and a level five shithole is better than a level six. your logic's inescapable.
i shouldn't be at all surprised.
they don't even realize they should be frightened.
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death?
there are no more rooms.
the page's missing. then their sos was real.
yes... it's called an echo.  the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs.
mom, have you seen woody?
if we surrender, and i return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
and the third one?
they're doing more than slapping.
mrs. foster -- send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that --
you don't seem very sure.
you read eddie's chase manhattan bombing summation in the leftist law anthology?
no.
no.  havana, louisiana.  don't we have a meet?
you want me to go in there?
hurry!
the sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  now listen to me:  it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  if it doesn't, then it's no good.  i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
now, where we goin', convict?
well, hello there...chocolate,
he shoots dope too.
objection! these remarks are profane and irrelevant.
i'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
throw that torch away, young man. give yourself up. you're under arrest.
don't you work with ian?
sure.  set me up and then don't tell me.
jesus, it's dark in here.
can you stand something to eat?
now don't start talking against the union again.
how serious?
you know who this is?
let's popeye around the chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
...why do you think?
hippy, you pussy.
alan?  where are we going?  you see something?
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
hello.
oh my god! you're at southglen south? they have a killer baseball team.
i wanna see jamie lee's breasts. when do we see jamie lee's breasts?
fun -- look at that guy...
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... it's soo good to see you. how long are you here for?
why?
i don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
i’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. if you can’t, don’t worry about it. i’ll call in about an hour anyway. sorry but i’m in a hurry. 
funny.  can i phone london?
you're welcome.  did you know him?
there's somethin' wrong about it, mother.
oh. sorry.
this'll pass.  everybody thinks like this now and then.  come to bed.
no. perhaps i work too much.
flip.
besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there?
to bring your sister those birds. you said it was her birthday. besides, i was coming up anyway.
sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, i ain't got it. i chased enough girls in my life. i went to enough dances. i got hurt enough. i don't wanna get hurt no more. i just called a girl just now, and i got a real brush-off, boy. i figured i was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. some stupid woman who i didn't even wanna call up. she gave me the brush. i don't wanna go to the stardust ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like i was a bug. i got feelings, you know. i had enough pain. no, thank you.
when did this happen, honey?
...wanna savor this.
we finally graduated, big dude guy!
south dakota - but on the top.
i'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
ok.
twenty bucks?
torture cage.  can't stand... can't sit... for days.  sometimes weeks.
good afternoon, mr. campbell.
so eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
the vintage look is over, kat. haven't you been reading your sassy?
six month stint on datus.
you're not dangerous!  you're crazy!  i ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
is this what you wanted?
say, baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
so, it is true, dr. jones? you found nurhachi?
i can't tell.
i'll go. i'll bring jake out here.
fiction or non-fiction?
uh, look, diz...
i was hopin' you'd be there.  maroon's called here about four times.  he says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  he says he can help you.
you're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
he has proposed to me twice.
did i know you at princeton, tom? i didn't, did i?
is it nice?
'you duff anderson?
seat 74.
two.  sherry?... nice joint. you look very pretty.
let me get on your shoulders.
what do we got?
you mean that old woman i saw sittin' in the window wasn't norman bates' mother?
you're looking at him.  we provide the plane, transportation cost, u.s. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  you provide the pick up point in south america, and are responsible for payment.  you assume all the bust risks.  we take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. this is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  if not, we can forget we had this conversation.
see you tomorrow, miss boatwright.
why are you trying to kill us?
there you are, both of you. max, karen has decided it's time to go.
put it down or i'll shoot.
you're a shrink, doc. aren't i supposed to be able to tell you everything?
i mean, i've done what i came to do.  it shouldn't hurt this much. but it will pass...
you know, you could work in a wine store.
i didn't teach you that.
who told you that?
ghosts killed your father?
we never met in court or anyplace else.
having a good time, vivian?
can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
some areas have power - they're on line to san onofre.
why would the kid shoot at us?
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
what?
she is horrible.
let's go.
this is all the same creature.  we're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
a secret army.  the army of the twelve monkeys.  i've told you about them. they spread the virus.  that's why we have to get to philadelphia.  i have to find them -- it's my assignment.
mommy, i'm scared.
you're sort of a rude person.
listen, americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  you take a little and then come back.
scott my boy, come here. how was your day?
.....me neither.
i can't control mine- i'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
i told you.  i don't like to talk about that.
your face ... are you hurt?
i am not threatening you.
i won't let 'em.
forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
yes--
i've heard the name.
no.  i said that.
what the hell do you want?... hey, sue ann, what's up?
well, here we are.
is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
i’m really sorry you were not called...
i may have said some- thing. i don't recall.
blasé and epicene.
let's see...do you know her cup size?
oh, that's nice.
well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
kill me.
do you know the kentucky friend mouse story?"
a surgeon might...
you shouldn't have had any doubts.
it's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank. but he's got a problem. he's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
harry -- i'm blind!
i'm in the picture on wendy's wall. niagara falls. family trip. little wendy foreground. me background. what are the odds on that one?
no, i'm not. why do you think she does all this? it's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. when you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. to tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... but you had something you wanted to ask me?
-- and what did dr. paley do after you stopped seeing him?
are you okay?
just goes to show you. twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
how about lankaster merrin.
except for prom.
he's giving them up?
who'd you ever do a favor for? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
will...i...
but the dance is in the gymnasium.
what?
i don't know, i just thought.
he'll play with his rifle, i expect. that will cheer him up.
the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested, mccord -- james mccord -- he headed up security for the committee to re-elect.  he turns out to be ex-cia.
mmmmm, this is tasty.
'really a lot appreciate it...'
you have no conception of this, do you?
what do you mean "why"?
yeah, yeah. i'm on it.
from the magazine?
victor. he was trying to be gracious.
so, it was your first time.
no.  i don't.
you can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
paul sheldon? you mean paul sheldon the writer?
what are you talking about?
hiya jake. that was some dance.
he flies as well, then . . .
jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
oh come on.
i'm sorry, i just hallucinated.
look. you want to talk about this?
sure does. but i'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
you went there? i've wanted to go there, but i thought it was off limits.
hi.
say what you want and you'll see --
are you a good lawyer?
no.  and he ain't been eating so good, either. he's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
you lame taylor?
... and that i needed his help.  it wasn't so bad really.  i sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  i took care of him.  i made him happy.
where he can't get it?
well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
the cubicle across from you is empty.
how about mrs. ackerman? we both hate her!  should she be the next victim?
daddy, i want to discuss the prom with you. it's tomorrow night --
it's supposed to be even hotter today.
hi!  macy struthers -- co-host on the f. f. show.
is that snoopy?  in the purple doo rag?
she said, your name was alvy singer.
what are you doing?
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top.
i'm sorry, frank, but i don't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
i don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
because i don't want one.
the world is fantastic. it's the ultimate absurd circus. i am shot from a cannon into the energy.
i have to go back to birmingham.
"a faithful heart makes wishes come true."
what's happened...
right. something black though.
'fraid so.
if i fail, you fail.
go home, adam.  go to your hotel.
i beg your indulgence, ambassador, but it is.
i kissed shirley felder on the teeth.
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
yessir?
another little problem.
i would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
you see, major, you have nothing to worry about rick.
man i'm starving too, i think i'll go for the surf and turf.
help someone!
you got your stuff?
he'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
the broad has disappeared...
my husband...
i'd like to do your hair sometime.
and we didn't come down here to audition.  business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> nicholas calls.
please, uncle al.
she okay?
i'm glad you and the general didn't have to leave us. we would feel quite deserted..
we have just folded space from ix...
they were wearing masks.
get out! get out of the car!  get out of the fuckin' car!
man against nature, right travers.
exactly.  it's the key.
what is this, a joke, right?  some kind of elaborate practical joke? at my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the class president's hotel room and --
we object, your honor. it would unfairly influence the jury.
don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
ok.
i'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
no... that wasn't right. i want you to be my wife.
tone down our headlines? lacy, that's all the common man reads!
you crazy? with all those people around?
tore up from the floor up?
actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  there's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
i'm so glad you're alive.
don't you gamble?
nope.
how?
i didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
<u>there never was a jason bourne</u>.  you have to come with me.  it's the only way.  we can give it back to you...
i said... stop!
oui. nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
hello.
but dr. evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. a few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
it may make very fine poetry, mr. hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
no.
now nick, what's that got to do with it?
goodnight john. sleep well.
... yes, i follow your thinking on that.
ernie's?
the food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, cole?  to that "dying" world'
i'm not sure yet. ask me again later.
let's go.  we're takin' her home!  move it!  get the cars!
you just shoot at something?
sweeney.
well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
oh. is that how you met him?
i wouldn't let you. good luck with depinto.
why?
what's your plan, mack?
three more, i figure.
she's such a great photographer.
he supports me.
just this morning. animal hairs were found all over the victims.
i'm tired of playing overseas.  thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
will you wait for me?
oh no. you had to marry him because you got pregnant?
it's not like we're too busy.
good answer.  same goes double for me.
say, this is snugsville.
i think it's time we got some professional help.
take your shot, kid -- you got money for trainin' expenses?
no.
did miss lawson and mr. marsh ever argue?
daniel give me that beanshooter!
we've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  we need to abort.
they may be looking for us, james.  use this.  you can fix it in the men's room.
finally, some common sense...
time for lunch.
if you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
i'm afraid i am.
hi, ace.
do you like kids?
oh, come on, now. this is serious. you're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
good of you to stop by.
no, i'm sorry, but no. we'll savage what we can from the plane. then we head for the coast. there may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
and this makes you "sad"?
hell, what am i holding back for? why don't you just give me everything you got here?
relax, okay? you don't have to do anything. just go in there and pretend. it won't kill you to do a little favor like that. besides, you might even learn something.
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma!
.... i hate to ask, but... did you ever think you'd miss communism?
i made a mistake.
this is chaz speaking.  sorry, but we are not home.  our present location seems to be only halfway to irth. remain at your posts and stand by. that is all.
big day. two jaws to rebuild.
the good outwitting the bad.  it's like birdson had a split personality.
... but it is a good question, and i suppose i'll always wonder about the answer:  why would they send me back without proof?
looking for someone?
if that was the r, i'd love to see the x.
you calling phil and randy?
i couldn't face her if i had slept with somebody else.
who are you?
hi, gale, any leads?
feels good.
i'm glad you're around to say it.
yes. that is surprising.
uh... sure... come in.
do you expect me to believe you?
thirty-two and change.
what's his problem?
-- objection, your honor! this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
whoa. some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. i'm a brewski man myself.
we can digest our-
hi.
what's this all about?
the other one?
what do you know about them?
with... with annie, of course.
...yes...
don't go out there!  stop him!
why do you ask so many questions? what difference does it make how carlos and i feel? feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
no, american is a blessed title directly sent from god's soul to your mind. we shall never change that! i mean the name of the publisher. charles foster craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry i need. i was thinking about "kane" -- you like that?
hittites,  the mesopotamians and the sumerians.  "zuul was the minion of gozer."
would you shut the fuck up! i know what you ordered, i was there!
mr. san pedro sula's authorized to carry a .45.
i'm done.
you claiming it was all a misunderstanding, ken?
and oswald?
well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, i've sworn off playing poker.
mom!!!
twenty-six, twenty-seven.  so far so good.
is it this aisle or the next one over?
yeah.
isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
i have. or there would be twice as many.
do you know what he's talking about?
what's that?  present from faith?
it does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, mr. bernstein?
all right!  all right! ... no more, please.  we will find you a shrubbery ...
what can i do?
break left! break left!   chaff! flares!
i'm not.  you're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
do you know what year it is?
you know the answer to that.
chum?
..."how now, cried arthur. 'then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'that is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
that wraps it up -- tex has the money. go back to bed -- i'll let you know when i've found him.
i know. i just do.
excuse me...
want to know something?  i don't quite know.  i hadn't planned this.
he's dead.
you tricked me.
you do?
amanda, i told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. you never listen.
you mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe?
don't say that.
-- it was "la belle aurore."
merle... hey, merle, listen...  why?
then you know how bravely your son met his death.
...nah, that ain't right... i'm thinkin' of...
proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
on his heels!  gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  elizabeth, are you --
um ... you gotta turn off main street.
i just... ann is very...
wow.  you two really have something going, don't you?
they didn't find the shotguns. they planted them.
i think of it as an agreement. a word your father liked to use.
be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. but the bed's good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  in fact, i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
good. i want to talk to you.
is she looking at me, baby?
which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now. that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
if you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, i'll kill you, dyle -- here and now. okay?
how can i ever thank you enough?
laz, i know about that girl.  good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  oh, laz. she's had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
i resent god's monopoly.
elroy.
still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
looks like you did more than jackoff while i was gone.
last friday. she left work, and home... i was in tucson over the weekend... i haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
she's in the bathroom...she's still working.
i think you mean that.
cindy, let me...
you're not going to trial?
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. for now, that's all you need to know.
we've got to put that, into the inaugural.  "i have here, a ribbon.  you haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  for it is the proud possession of a few, a very few men and women... it is the ribbon of the albanian campaign...."
i don't know if that's going to happen.
well...i used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  lately i'm not so sure.
a lot of people like our singing.
i've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you, jeremiah. i've just always been too scared to show it.
i was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
i want to stay.
so, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
you win some, you loose some.
... my suitcase.
who invited you?
leo, you were in there, you saw what i did.  you think they're gonna let me write pictures?  hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
how you doing?
they're gone.
the deal's too good, frankie
i put him to work.
so i got it wrong, then.
can't it go to any office?
i'm afraid lhe's not a doctor.
but what?
course it's a good idea.
this is cute.
do you follow her every day?
so go take your job on wall street.
you got plenty of money?
wait. let me get this out.  i like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. i read passionately, and i like to discuss things. i'm basically conservative, but flexible. i've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
you don't seem all that proud.
then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  i've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  i'm going to bring that boy back.
...not at all...
and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
no ma'am. i have been asleep all my life up to this moment. marylin, will you marry me?
you called the police?
hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what i need is not the...what do you need...?
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes, my darling - what if...
he's good. he's fine.
me?
there.
barney, who is this bimbo? he a regular customer?
me?  no.  well, in the accident i was injured, but...
then what are you doing here in bodega bay?
what?  what is it?
what for?
i had my kid brother, dominick, run it for me.
just say the word, sir, and i'll do anything.
are you going to let erik wake the gods?
some, thanks.  enough to move on, for now.
mm.?
at the moment?  carl smith.
keep painting.  promise me.
and then -- to prove your truly mine -- i'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
catch me at the vancouver royal if it's important.
where are we?
yeah?
tell him i took the day off 'cause i wasn't feeling so hot.
oh please annette. you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. well here it is. right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. i'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. if we were, i'd propose, but that's not going to happen. so i guess we're just fucked. i'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. and that makes you a hypocrite.
what are you looking for?
are you going to take me to see mom?
what's that you're wearing?
like...?
like gang-busters. now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
i know, dear.  i understand. but try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  and especially today — let's forget about it. we want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
nobody's going to hang.  we're all gonna walk away with a little something.  i ain't a greedy man. and, hell, you did all the work. one-hundred-thousand dollars.  split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  give or take.
it's just not working out, but i'm getting my own place in the city... and i've got it all planned out. it's something i've wanted to do for a long time...
we'll come in low out of the rising sun -- we'll put on the music about a mile out.
no, more commercial stuff.
bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. ok?
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i don't know. maybe it'd clear things up in my head. i'll tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
right.
what?!
good luck.
anything?
we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.
maybe i'll go ridin.
i've lost interest.
what'd i tell you?
leave me alone!
uh, huh.
look at that:
what's taking you so long about it?
hello?
i'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
we're fine!  how are you?
oh no... no you don't.
i didn't mean to bite him. he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and i bit him accidental.
you straight?
carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. they finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. only charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. he beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. it's taken gideon, tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
didn't think you would.  i'm going to go make the coffin.
my daughter.
what the hell happened?
he's not paying you one cent!
yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  this one took some work.
you too, sir.
where's ganz?
i told him to leave me alone.
alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  what do you want to do?
the chinese have a proverb: "that which appears too good to be true, usually is." there's gotta be a catch.
madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "i am delighted to have you here"? i have not reached that stage of civilization.
i feel like we're making real progress here.
all right, i'll do it.
get your things together, you have to leave!
aren't you going to take the pills?  they'll knock that headache out.
yes?
i beg your pardon?
what are you doing here?
all i know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. but when they fired you... you were so devastated, andy... i don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. fight for your rights.
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
sheerotards. catchy name, isn't it? like leotards.
kevin?  do you not love me?
like what?
sorry. i -- i don't make the rules.
what is this?  'twenty questions'?
and now you have everything.
yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
how come?
...this is a toast!  this is a toast.
because i'm tired of not understanding things.  cops, mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out i really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
shooting at maybe eight feet. i can't use any lights.
ni-notchka.
they weren't related. the guy used a 38. no pennies. totally amateur.
course not.  i no flum here.  i come flum cathay.
thought you bought the farm down there, x. glad as hell to see you.
he says okay, it's all right catherine comes here.
maybe i wasn't there when you called.
what does this have to do with my testimony?
of course, you don't.  i'm glad you came. my callers are all professional. clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. second-raters, the lot.
which they do.  and we're standing there. all the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an espn crew.  so i turn to her and sort of grandly say, "well, this is me, klutz, asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me." and i took out the ring, and i don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  we're getting married in february.
i just came from a meeting... i can't talk about it now, baby. but in a few days -- see i'm disgusted with my life.
'joe...'
this is a travesty! captain rhodes is...
i am?
my apologies, miss.  as you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
silliest thing i ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
what!?
get out.
good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
i can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
where's the money?
well, i don't know... call it a fringe benefit.
and you think we got a chance to find her?
all right!  tell us about the truck!
your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. if they're black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. been that way since before you were born.
courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." you'll love it. and then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. i think that'll follow nicely.
i got your goddamn money, you little punk. now where's my daughter?
could it be the crew? if they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
what are you doing?
you've done it again and i am responsible. how can you forget yourselves this way? you were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
but maybe with a good start i can hit those hand-holds.
-- burn them.
something happens to my confidence.
ahm.  that thing i was doing tonight -- i'm not doing it any more.  i told them i had to spend the evening with britain's premier equestrian journalist.
why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
aren't you?
oh, no..i have to get home...
is this what you killed them with?
it's a bloody funny thing. you know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  it's a bloody funny thing.
i was born jaundiced. once i sat on a toilet seat at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. and i've learned to live with this chicken bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so i knew dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  dad, i don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. it can only mean one thing.  cancer.  i'm dying.
seems like i do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. and everything is everything.
we're all set,  sir.
i told you to go on in.
what are you doing here?
what is it?
what's with her costume?
romeo and ethel the pirate's daughter…almost finished?
what was this desperate urge to see me?
lieutenant anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
if it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
where is it?  he. the boy you said my brother bought! where is he?
it's our anniversary, panes.
and you ...?
herbert.
i'm getting her out of there!
looks good. how much did it cost?
i'm an old friend of the mayor's.  i just want to say hello to him.
good morning, mr. treves. it'll be his bath-time soon. has he eaten?
you got clicks, anything?
call me irish, but i don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
i have personally vouched for you in this matter, captain.
i can't sleep.
doctor. ear, nose and throat man,.
right now?
very nice to meet you.
let's forget it--can't you see i kind of like you, too ... and i don't want to get involved.
that's what you said in turley. you remember how that ended.
that's right. i don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in london.
not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
where's who?
excuse me for a minute. be right back.
i have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
yeah.  he closed a deal.
i could let them go for ten.
uh-huh
is anything wrong? are you ill?
where did you get that sweater?
my mother is dying. when she is dead, i'll come back and we'll be married.
no.
now who's the dreamer, superman? even you can't fly that fast!
unbelievable, huh?
you see what i mean? if laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in casablanca bring on? i advise that this place be shut up at once.
yes, sir.
she's not tied up!
hey!
six kilometers.  four miles.
how did i do this?! maybe you didn't notice but i'm in jail!
you don't.
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, i've never told anyone except my king... charles the seventh... the one and only king of france.
i know.  it sucks.
where have you been?
wait...and with talks at the united nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on mps of all parties in westminster.  speaking on the jimmy young show earlier today, mrs thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  what is it?
no, sir!
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
james will be there . . . and mario! only they'll be saints.
hi, brad.
you catch anything he was saying?
sweetie, have you ever heard of walt whitman?
where were you mom?  did you meet a guy?
you don't understand!  the octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
it's a long detour to dead lake. what would we find?
daddy!  where have you been?
no.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  i'm gonna go now.
no water -- what a place!
wild ride, huh?
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
please excuse this interruption.
i don't understand.
you're making a mistake, mr. deeds.
the power of this place is old and always restless. sometimes the dead do more than speak. remember, doc.
but that's what happened before.
i was born in a city housing project in the bronx ok? it's not in the cards that i die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
i was born in the transkei, on the wild coast.
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left radcliffe!
you thought i was mom?
why tell me this?
might make kind of a social issue, not having any other negro officer.
that's right...
a lowly player.
of course not.  only by a director of the firm.  who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
what about you?
no, i'm not it.
meet sylvia. and elloise and sam. and ed. and doreen.
sam! do me a speech, do me a line.
marty, you haven't changed a bit!
my place faces a truck street. i've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
i got it!  everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
with fast food farley at the helm it'll be tv dinners from now on.
the mcp blasted it... there are very few domains left with any power at all.
john believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like i have and that view seems a little soporific. and not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
i think we'd better discuss this in my office, mr. mitchell.
tell me a joke funny man. hee hee.
i love you, too.
it's already started.
extraordinary!
you kill me, you really do.  the first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
come with me to california.
up here, boss.
that's my hard luck--i'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
for all those vacation days you got coming.
i saw him on t.v.  some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue.
when i buy my zoo, i'm leaving them things the hell out!
i know.  this is a dream, sarah.
all i'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  money!
supposing we could get out of this room?  is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
wait!  wait!
insane ... ?
hi!
....i dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
yeah.  so sue me.
just before we caught jimmy... i had a dream that i was being chased. and i was running with other people. old- fashion indian people. i got shot in the back. like leo.
will you excuse...
it's a long story.
the cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
she'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound christmas fruitcake. she's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
get to sleep indy -- i stay up and keep eye on things...
no. precisely. we begin by coveting what we see every day. don't you feel eyes moving over your body, clarice? i hardly see how you couldn't. and don't your eyes move over the things you want?
isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
can i have a word with you?
nothin. quit lookin' at me like that!
who?
why do you say that?
you saved my life.  you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
miss bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or i'll have you and patchett in shit up to your ears.
thank you.
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
donna was a girl i knew in florida.
mom, tell him i'm not going.  you already promised me!
what did you say?
i never was.
i mean it, give it your best shot, cause i'm tired of you holding that over my head.
that we should crunch our hands with this stone. that way we'd never forget what happened today.
how's the ipo?
is mom okay?
which one was wearing the strange clothes?
she's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
is that all?
...huh?
way to go, dude.  if you will it, it is no dream.
your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
you got that right.  and we ain't brothers.  maybe we should just end this right here.
murder.  beautiful.
all the more reason to go to africa.
so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
i mean let's face it, mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- i'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
you bet your boots, leo.  it's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise. upward and onward.  say, you'll join me.  nothing can stop us.
i think you'd better sit down.
i'm gonna miss you.
any other i.d.s come up?
then we have to find a safe port around here.  got any ideas?
i was just saying, i'm going to cable downing street, see if i can't stir up a few shillings - katharine's mother and the pm's wife are best -
you're joking.
why don't you answer?
there was this kid there saying, "go in there and save my father, mister." and i'm thinking about my boy joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. it was like i was supposed to save myself.
who cares? chicks are for fags.
this is incredible -
yeah.
you own a hotel, sir?
i reckon not.
no. why?
you know what would be great?
yeah, i dig him.
how much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
will he show mercy to my country? will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
you owe my mother.
i don't think she's real big on hate.
shall i be forced to feed you, mr. kessler?
that's the way i look at it. a choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. but i ain't no madman either. what the fuck was joe thinkin'? you can't work with a guy like that. that motherfucker's unstable. what do you think? do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
wait.
where is it?
what. you're what? you're with this creep now.
the medical bill are 61 thousand now. i've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
aye.
this must have been in the family a long time.
i ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because i'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
did you see that?
you people got a lotta nerve.
it's a tachyon chamber.  it generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  there are other worlds, daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
perfect example.
let's get outta here.  you want to?
i think this is the first time you have been to my little place. your face is new to me. now, what shall it be?
that's a terrible idea-
fuck you.
good samba dancing...?
my fault? ... oh, jabez -- all i want is to be proud of him. he can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
and that hard-on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
are you klingman?
sorry.  i don't know anything about it.
oh, you're the great joe's attorney now?  are we going to go to court? or are we going to go to bed?  and i don't mean you and me.  i mean you and him.
let's not.
that goes double for me.
yeah?
call cecile up and get her to come over. i'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
you didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
what -- ?
oh, my god!
what the hell are you talking about --
charles moore for instants.
true. should we stop them?
did i use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
your mother? jesus, miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
i know it sounds funny, but i'm gonna try.
she is well. she is - well, actually, i'm about to become a father! she only told me last night. you are the first to know.
jessie?  looks like your friend found company.
she says she's lonely...
kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
i flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. the one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
a dime. one thin dime for a cup of coffee.
come on, sid. give me the gun.
you find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
hey.
ahh, i just wanna look nice.
who did he ask for?
try some other ways. 
mr. caddy? my name's bob woodward, i'm from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
ten, fifteen minutes ago.
why are you afraid? we've always been friends. one might even say that i brought you up ... isn't it true, ali?
syracuse.
this is insane. let the heroes handle it.  i'd better get you home...i should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
holy shit. your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
it's a bug.
oh yeah, what's that?
... population three hundred million...
i want something i can print!
understood. what is your plan?
about thirty million to one.
i don't find your language that charming.
what do they have on the streets? the area.  they must have something.
who're these guys?
this wire came while you were gone. your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
listen you little asshole, i oughta --
this is a nightmare.  we should have kept him upstairs.
well, i'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
it'll bring us together again, hildy -- just the way we used to be.
your father is julian cross, isn't he?
do you have a passport?
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced?
hey, i'm not stupid, y'know. they can't build anything like that yet.
he!!??  how dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
tell me all.
what did you need?
and threw us into the lake.
does it make you happy?
that's what i was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
...ray?
whattaya mean?
they're nobody's fans! they're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
you've been drinking. your tipsy.
something like that, yes.
no, you can.  tell him to get on the fucking phone!
where is he?.
where is he?
heidi - why didn't you come down here?
john, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. i know you think you're doing your job, and i can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. none of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the la police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
yeah. i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too.
are you honest?
now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. i'm not a great fool, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. but you must have known i was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
i don't know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
where's irth?
you here again?
he was a prick when i was six, and he's a prick today.
hurry up.
daddy, what if the face comes when i'm at mommy's?
thank you, vicki.
the loser has to keep american clean, how's that?
no...
who's baxter?
that was good.
i don't have any.
i'll be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
npa metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  that's when we'll get him.
suppose those contained all the file info too? you could have a third or so of it there.
you fucking liar!
why there?
yeah.
well, i guess he's found one.
just get me out of here as soon as you can.
are you better now?
did you read her mind ?
forged papers! now, what?!
really?
i gotta take some money out, that's what for.
finish him, finish him. your way.
who are you? who are you working for, huh?

like the genie in the bottle.
can i talk to hearst?
and laszlo?
"march 7th - glen asked me to sleep with him again.  i can't yet - i like him, i want to make him happy but i'm not sure that i love him. i can't sleep with someone i don't love."
nilsen.
you mean... george mccord, the actor?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns, harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   then mr. stearns, he tried to fix a case.
me!
what's that? a hundred?
you don't seem excited, my little muffin.
i'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. i feel funny about coming into a dark house.
yah, real good. how you doin'?
what is with this school and prom?
remember what i told you about that twentieth crack? all right, you've just made it. before you go unconscious i want you to get this through your nut.
all men love. but men like hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
this is really happening, isn't it?
mr. jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
how about your new friend?
of what?
i'm done with her now. tonight really creeped me out.
we give it one more hour. did the photographer do the dogs?
folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons:  money. adventure.  solitude.  those cover most everyone.  but frontiers also draw another type of man.  one with a demon in his gut.  he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
you mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
feeling all right?
i have sectors 1-28.  i think hector has the upper levels.
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, i'm afraid of him.
i did. are you?
kate reynolds...
why did you forget the tent check?
what exactly did you want to discuss, pat?
he's better dead. i know he was mixed up - but not like that.
so the huron are the servants of the french?  to do what the french are shamed to do?
so you want to know.
she was damaged and unstable.  the more i tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  finally, she showed up at the new house...
drop 'em! drop, drop, drop!!!
where is she?!
don't get yourself all worked up--
that's not what i mean.
did you hear me, lad?
thanks, gary...take care, man, i gotta get back.
why not?
you don't even know jacqueline gibson.
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse?
have you been up all night again?
yes, generally, to see pap. however, point number two: a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
you shouldn't judge, brenda.
well, i don't care who she is.  we can't sing without her!
someone left the goddamn gate open.  otis got out.  skye and i, well the... i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
yes, dear.
i surrender --
just wander.
this is some serious shit.
please.
it's what he would have wanted, sir.
no answer. you have no passport and your embassy’s out. how do you plan to leave the u.s., mr lombard?
keep thinking.
you picked another winner!
that smells like fresh coffee.
god damn it gus, you dug up my wife! what the fuck is going on around here?!
what are we doing?  ray, i was ready to kill you.
it was in your book.
n-n-no, not that.
happy? why shouldn't i be happy? i'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  here you are, king. let's drink.  let's drink to us .  we finally made it, didn't we?
never.
you've always hated my taste in the past.
lose something?
depends on what you're seeing.
...just some stuff.  a little of this, a little of that, that's all.
they'll do it.
i was an fo for the 25th.
hiya carla.
oh!
-- even if i give you a million as well?
yeah.

then you have everything.  you can put them away.
oh brad.

i thought you said no staff, bazza!
they grab ugarte and she walks in. well, that's the way it goes. one in, one out. sam?
oh, what was the name of that doctor? harry's doctor?
we have to find the dog, ryan.
a little mushy!  you think the taxpayers would like it, utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
the stranger staying at the inn, is he someone from misery's past?
we have a commission. if there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
is it over 'cause you're sick?
true love. you heard him. you could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
i gotta get'em fixed.  they don't roll down.
hello, spiro. merry christmas.
don't count on it.
you're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
this man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
sorry.  maybe i need the valium.
dad, please...
harm to whom?  me?  i don't think, so.  try him again at the hotel.
good. i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room.
maybe. you want to play?
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
so?
in nomine patris et filius, et spiritus sancti.
don't say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead.  well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
seemed like a good idea.
don't run. they'd like any excuse to shoot us.
please, ryan.
oh, it's ridiculous, who am i to make a criticism to someone like you?
for work.....
why do you think he took his gloves off?
you cannot run from your destiny, conner.
why don't we take oxygen?
that was meant for me!
are you 'fucking with me!?
no, he would've loved it!  bela's returned from the grave -- like dracula.  cue vampira!
i never tried to get you to like me.  i tried to get you to love me.
so maybe wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
you'll have to send us a postcard.
well, look who's here! hello, dear.
will you get time off to do that?
it doesn't sound insane, truman.  i swear i see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday.
we'll see.
the phone number of anna scott's agent in london and her agent in new york. you can ring her.  you think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i ain't even a fuckin' sicilian!
um...now is not a good time, okay. detective jackson's hurt.  he's fine. i've got a fire marshall shot, detective jackson is hurt but not seriously.
my sympathies.
it isn't brains. it's how you use them.
look at her face. a real bitch.
hey, stop worrying, colonel. fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
no, i don't.
nobody else is going down but me, okay?
why do you care about this kind of stuff?
now if i got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
it is not.
um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'cause i don't speak swahili.
well, everybody needs a hobby.
what do you think?
so what's the, uh, problem this time?
no.
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen.
she hasn't got any.
i'm not afraid of the fire anymore. it will purify me...
i'll stick it in the evidence locker...
she loved him.
lord's name.
i thought you were out of town!
yes, i am.
starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
ray, you protected ty and larry up in casitas, didn't you?
her condition isn't quite what it seems. nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. the ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
where are you going?
christ, i haven't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978.
well, what do you want to do?
tell me.  has black peter already crossed off a few bad children?
where's kelly?
what are you doing?
are you all right?
tommy, let's put the tape on.
your article sucked.
all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
where'd you get this?
which color was that?
i can wait. where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night...
but she couldn't handle it.
don't push it, larry.
it's very good bernie.
oh god.
this is mr. wallace in subscriptions?
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds!  poor rob!  laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  you let me believe that!
hey, baby, say hello to felicia.
who knows, it may even help business. buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott.
you are slovenly and unattractive and i won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
well... the store at saltzburg...  but you won't be going to saltzburg for a while.
it's a cocktail.  mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
brad - i'm cold, i'm wet, and plain scared.
i know more than i want to know about it. who's the father?
would you mind keeping your voice down? i have guests.
what is this?
that's right on my way.
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  he <u>kills</u> people!
don't talk like that!
so it's like you want to be secret friends.
and?
he doesn't want my help any more. he doesn't need it.
i told you not to make that deal, saddam!
jesus... i, zorn... i have to call his family. tell them...
state your name, please.
it's silly of you to be apprehensive.
we think we've got our finger on the buyer.
what makes you interested in becoming a hare krishna?
it's an integer proof.
add it to the list.
whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
did you sleep alright?
i should have phoned... but i wanted to see you... be with you...
i gotta go to little rock.
you just met me.
what if you can't find him? what if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
if you really mean it, i will.
you will never touch her. you will never get near her.
thank you.
not me, man.  i'm no drug dealer, what you think.
who does clark kent think he is anyway! he never even said good night!
well?
screw lucy!
ok, whatever. let's go get your brother's truck. faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
well, look here!
oh my god.  are you serious?
two way?
maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  last time i checked, you weren't black.  i'm not sure what the hell you are.  but i know you aren't a black man.
mr. wood, this is mr. reynolds, your landlord.  could you please open up?
he'll need a pretext.  he'll never figure one out for himself.
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days i'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
but first i'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
she's not going to marry that guy. she went home to tell her mother.
what's the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole?
excuse me, but how old are you?
where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. where you're from is what happened to you.
this isn't just a mood ring.
where the hell were you?
it's your deal.
there... were no other ships in the sector.
certainly, sir. how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
to look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
a recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
won't keep you a moment, sir.
i heard sir te lost something.  and now madame te's not feeling well...
well, why don't i just say black so you can say white!  don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. he hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! you should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "worth every penny."
how bad off is he?
...wow....wow! hey, ms. jenzen -- ?
saunders. that's better.  good morning, saunders. hello, saunders. how's the bill coming, saunders--?
it's just the god damned english doing everything by the book.
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
it wasn't your fault, alex.
hi.
yeah, i have to help my father.
flying the plane.
stop! you aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
i got a new car. only it's red. did you know mama died?
yes ma'am.
do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
i was it.
you've never had any formal training, either?
no plans for the weekend, linda?
what about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? have they all arrived?
i will.
his nervous breakdown followed hobbs. could he kill again if he had to save his life? or would he hesitate?
give me your hat...
i think i remember linda, yah.  she was - yah. so things didn't work out, huh?
...come in earlier on mike's marine barracks line when he's talking to sheikh mussawi...
we were supposed to draw a picture. anything we wanted... i drew a man. he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
i know but this is different. he's a crazy man. he might kill you.
get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
oh no. in the car you did it?
tick-tock...
penfield.  james penfield.
is that --?
earl!  you said the planes were ready but -- but what?
see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings.  funny thing but i can't really remember how she looked.  i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package.  can't put it together for some reason.
-- you got your shower --
because -- it's beyond intellect. it's emotion.  it's passion.  it has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
about what?
mark shale.
it's all real. look.  the storage tanks for the whales.
but, hey, some good news.  this last one put me way ahead of schedule. we've actually got some time to kill.  jazz?  you like jazz?
did you have trouble performing? yeah, that's...
did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
i don't think i'm going to the party.
bret. what the hell is going on?
how did you know?
how many you got in there?
and i'm on yours.  land of the free.
what did these people do when her heart stopped?
yeah, sure. look what happened to them.
don't know. just shot up one day from a stump.
it's not just the cable system.  it's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  it's everywhere.
the porter is going to talk to us tonight.
anything?
that's it, bridge- we're all out!
it doesn't work, it always stays black. 
what did he say?
...yes.
what did he say?
there's something dangerously wrong with this ship, elaine.  i know its the wiring. that toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
you tried to run away.
i know...  you contruct a weapon.  look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
that's george.
jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
fill her up?
no.
what's this?
i'll do anything to please you, mr. taransky.
and what's that?
are you giving me orders?
jawohl.
i'm sorry.  it wasn't my intention.  but i had to see you.
when we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. the mountains have the highest concentrations. once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
what-are they speaking?
how do you like that one?
trouble with your air-conditioning.
you can't believe this bullshit.
all his victims are women... his obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. but not one women is hunting him - except me. i can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  i have to go to belvedere.
that's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, jack?
what makes you think he'll do it?
you got kids?
son!
get into bed.
now, why in the world would he do that?
great...
well, some of his throat was there.
it must feel great.
what?
he agreed that he was.
max.  this is anna.
claudia, i know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
i want to look around, daddy-- may i?
...you're dealin' with!
i'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
five g's—or i crab the works.
what is it? kiddie porn again? sexual battery of a patient? i've had my license taken away in three states.
good day.
doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
you aren't going to hurt me.  you aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
keep them coming.
ed concannon.
the one and only little richard.
what are you going to do?
pause play.
when it comes.
you look beautiful.
z, old pal...  shut up!!!  it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
i'm warning you.  you don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
how deep is the ocean?
we found each other, didn't we?
if i close m'eyes i can almost smell the live oak.
he's your client, huh?
not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  look at the diffusion, though....
some people.
what a memory.
so...what did you think of the tape.
a boy or a girl?
i was in my p.j.'s when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over.  see? i rushed right out of the house. i must look a mess. i'm so embarrassed.
you're supposed to make time. when was the last time you told her you love her?  when was the last time you two had sex?
bobby, bobby!  where're you hit?!
hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
why, he'll be back.
hand me the 3/8ths.
do you mind putting out the light?
sure, king.
i'll need to know more about this thing.
yes--me--in person!
i've never felt better in my life. when do you get off work?
yes.  but you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
so, what now? did those things leave?
well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. what else haven't ya been tellin' me?
i can't do it alone. i need you, to be madeleine for a while. then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
what the hell is that? resting his eyes! it's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
is he the one that killed keaton?
what is it, claudia?
glass, you're to stand by with your team.
what a good idea.
you gave the orders!
then tough luck, george, because you are.
they're dumb, somebody... i don't know...
sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
you're not a dumb fuck, are you, del?
you've been very cold to me tonight.
i was born.
what the hell happened!
you could have told me you were fiance number three.
mattie.  what about this?
guinan. it's important that you tell me what you know. we think soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. it might give him enough power to-
so where's the best place for mojitas?
you take the microwave?
well, i didn't actually see him do it. like i said.
i know.
i...
listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
don't cross me...
let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
oh yeah, sure. when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen. darlene louis. she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. darlene louis. you know you look a little bit like her.
whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  if they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
i've set my laser from stun to kill.
they're broadcasting...
no no no.
you scored blood money today, hooker.  you need a friend.
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said.
i'll die if i have to stay here another minute! i've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. if i have to, i'll go alone. it was i who bribed the porters. if it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
this part is dream, i think. there is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in spain... a village in spain. and then it clicks off, and is gone.
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
you saved kendall's life --
really? bulimic headcase.
get up out of the chair, richard.
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
we can climb out.
goodbye, muffin.
...old port point!  out at the presidio! of course i remember! i often go there!
i know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. get that money over here and i'll stop this run within five minutes.
no, that's not what i mean.  i mean -- look.  you know what made me leave that game?  coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
not who, food.  should we get italian.
you can see my predicament. my wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
i don't know what to say to him.  i can't.
wow. hey, you look good. like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? you, are still doing your painting?
yeah.
but y'see, chum, the problem i got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  you know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
you're no good for this business. it's just a joke to you...
where's the baby??
anyway... i did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  i did all that shit for a long time.
you deserve to die alone for what you've done.
i'm a push-over for whom?  what is it? who's on the phone?
you're such a nutcase, i can't even begin to keep up.
arctic warrior, arctic warrior, arctic warrior. this is united states coastguard station north island. your radio check is affirmative. over.
boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
no.
hi.
what the hell are you doing?
mine and professor krempe's.  we've been trading off nursing you in shifts. the rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. it's his turn for that just now.
before i became involved with paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  playboys. thrill seekers. middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her.
sir, i got taipei grindin' on me here. how long is this supposed to ta--?
look at us. it's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. we're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
mom, it's not fair if brady can say the f-word and i can't.
kids?
hey, nick. vien acca. [italian- american slang for 'come here']
okay, ray. i'm coming in. if he starts to leave the area, move in. and hold him. over.
you’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. where is the austrian?
and very true. your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
goodbye, charlotte.
mr. spock?
mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... jennyhaydn... money?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. i--i started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--i--i just naturally got aboard--
after a while, it became a little pathetic ... figured i'd put you out of your misery ...
well.
yes, it's so nice i thought i'd work outside.
whose truth are you talking about?
that's right -- premature ejection.
you know sid fletcher?
oh no, mr. merrick. i just work there.
and the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  they were checking out the renquist front.
he's a freelance subversive?
yes, you remember.
i'll show you it works.
no.
take it.  as soon as i get my money. fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  you don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
why do you say that?
can't say that i have.  can't say i've heard of a lot of people though.
about a dog.
i'm looking for a man.
he refuses to be seen in my company! he blanches at the mention of your name --
you remind me of my uncle.
preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. you want something, charlie?
but you escaped.
there must be a quarter-million out there, edgar.  they've been at it now for a year.  young kids just like tricia.  i don't know.  do you think they have a point, edgar?  maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
i said the truth!
donny --
not at all. i wasn't around much... so why did i get married? well, i thought it was a good idea at the time. have a home base. roots. you can get lost moving around so much.
i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to --
your police are at the gate?
if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.
there's nothing i can say for one small child?
wait, are you saying that i don't appreciate?
edward... you got it!
what's on your mind?
what are you going to do!?
what if it's not bullshit? if i bury zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
hey, great game friday. kicked holbrook's ass, huh?
someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
you've got a generous nature.  i like that in a person.  my name is max.

i thought you were almost engaged, stu...?
it's the last thing we need.
are you serious with this?
oh, hello vanessa. how was the flight?
chief...it's like none of this exists. i'm sorry.
no!... no...
i always knew that.
-- you're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
nothing.
wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
we been wantin' to ask you something. are you the guy on yv?
she sounds like a prisoner, taransky.  are you holding her hostage?  are you some kind of svengali?
where is she?
sounds more like aids...
yeah.  sure.  you mean ... tonight?
oh, gee, mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
no he didn't. come on, i don't want to be alone with those two. all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', i guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, chance?
say it.
i bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, nathan lee.
are you busy tomorrow night?
ugh!!  why do they have to do that?
i could have made it, you know.  i didn't need your help.
don't shush me. i am people! i want to make a speech. i want to overthrow the duchess!

that there was a gun pointed at me.
you've made me very happy, johnny.
whatcha reading?
or somebody else there is listening in --
navy transmission.  they're sent from wisconsin.
you know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? but, like, you know, have it set in here. you know, like, like, like, with her and shit. you know, like, you know, like, "closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
marty, it's howie gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
yes, a fistula too small to show up on the x-rays.
was it great?  better than great, it had to be...
don't let 'em off the ground.
so what did you think of the ballet? was it like a warm ice capades?
look here, jim--if you and joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, i'm going ahead and see those committees!
he's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.

a simple reason, mccoy. the obvious reason. to rob a bank.
how about you?
what else did you learn from your mind meld?
i know. you loved her. so did i. it was an awful shock to me, too. an awful shock. rose was so alive it's hard to believe.

i know, johnny, i know... .
i owe you a big one, hot pants.
i see. how do i know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
mr....kay?
you're killin' me here.
they're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the little lebowski urban achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
alright, well, let's say you make it to greenville. what's there, anyway?
what does that mean?
and big black from brooklyn, what do you do?
what do you mean there is nothing? that's impossible.
in my bed too.
al.
lestat escaped the fire!
we were just debating who had it worse, us or george washington and his guys.
now why does she have to be naked? how does that serve the plot?
you open it.
shh!  i'm coming!  i will feed you!
i am only insinuating that you are nervous.
...and i'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
'cause it clogs up your heart.
where's my mother?
did you watch it yet?
has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
what?
...yes?...
lloyd is doomed.
time comes, we knock on the door.  see if he wants to talk about old times. go in the easy way.

when i'm talking to children.
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family.
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
what are you talking about?
not for us?
well, sure... that's good, then.  all i mean is, i'm lucky i met you.
there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. my sentry markers are placed. i'm heading back to the base.
he didn't shoot it, ross. and no way by accident. there's a flash-burn. it was point-blank.
you doin' the hirin'?
i am. and i'm not ashamed of it. nobody ever said on their death bed -- "i treated myself too well."
clark street?  never heard of it.

you're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
not exactly. i wear it.  on my right hand. and only rarely.
i'm quite sure i don't know what you mean.
isn't this a fabulous picture?
how many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
what if they don't want help? what if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
eh --
my god.  is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair?  i thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
where you been keeping yourself? i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside.
it was more complicated than that. there was a reason.
no, i stopped. i didn't want to feel like i was being artificially modulated.

then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
let him out of here, lieutenant.
i had no idea she was this good.

wednesday at the park. we've got a lot of names coming in...
you're general kenobi?!?  the jedi knight!  the commander of the white legions?
why's that?
someone else c'n take your confession.
what do you think it was? was it that mig contact that did it?
you all right?
it's coming.
i'm cool.
how you doin'?
how about some ammo?
more bullets in the gun?
you upstart inky pup! now i will show you your place, which is in hell!
if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
i wasn't done, i was just sick of hearing him whine. and you didn't take him out, you scalped him. christ, i almost puked, did i tell you that?
pretty good speech, maggie.
he might well be. but not the way they say. he didn't crawl out of that car by himself. you saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
they just landed in the desert.
don't you people get it?  we're in the 21st century.  slavery was over four hundred years ago.  all that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  let's all grow up.
listen to me.  hear the words.
i'd better call her up and apologize. i don't remember taking her home last night.
theodore herzel.
oh my god! we're dead!
we can't survive this, sir.  they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt.
does it hurt?
uh-huh.
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. it's something we all have to learn to deal with.
how come you're leaving?
i guess we've never been introduced proper. jake mckenna.
you can break it, can't you?
yeah? and just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  you could give me something.
there was no need to kill her.
having fun.
no fingerprints?
that little shit!
is that what you do? draw pictures?
what's the code?
toto, are you pulling my leg or something? how is it possible to see this television without film?
that was quite something.
he might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
you mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
said it went on for donkey's years.
c'mon, walter.
oh yeah?
...but it's worth the risk. true or false: it's worth the risk.
i'd hold that off awhile.
yes. all those things are true.
what'd he say?
he was my blood -- and i demand to know what happened to him.
i don't know.
what?
don't!
but the shuttle-
no, jane.
how'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  get undressed. i want to see you.
but the power...
carlotta?
what do you want?
...leon’s not here. how did you get here? phil doesn’t know where i live.
oh right. the mustache coffee cup. the one that was sitting on the dash.
good morning, suzette.
you cut to the heart of things, don't you?  what about lynn bracken?  she going to be a hooker all her life?
have you heard?
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby. i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
i just wanted to see you.
bear. the colombians are in l.a. seems they all upset about their money. that ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was escobar's nephew.
it's no use.  they won't come into the lagoon.
i opened thousands of brains.
well -- this would be goodnight.
honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
great. hey, i've got a bit of a problem. i know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
now, look. i'll give this money to the colonel just as soon as you get started. we'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
there's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
i'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
tom sisler. he was murdered at school. two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
look, you cocksucker...
okay, twist, but you know if this blows up, i can't do ya no good downtown.  gondorff is federal.
how about that one? the host of the old south hotel.
they're not obliged to tell.
karla!
[and as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
wrong.
looks like her boyfriend did it. rod lane. musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
yes.
you're not just jealous, are you?  i mean, we both used to talk about her
"hey, yourself."
it was... fantastic.
please say it.
i was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
what next?!  -- a strange bra under my pillow!
we have something for your mother, for sonny, we have the tie for fredo and tom hagen gets the reynolds pen...
looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
ohhh...
on the contrary. gravity is foremost on my mind. look, i'm trying to make an ascent here. why don't you go pester dr mccoy for a while?
boy, i can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.

gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
we're clear.
the name is lonnegan.
okay i'll see you tomorrow night then.
$250,000 right off the top.
keeps to himself, more like.
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning.
what about you, wandering around alone? at least we have an alibi --
did you actually give williams that gun?
forty dollars -- was $250.
now?
i don't want to intrude.
go out there! find somebody, ask some questions!  i'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you. i keep thinking... something's wrong. i have to know what!
spock?
what you do is no business of mine. live and let live, i say.
isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
i was just passin' the time.
he's getting his cloak back. we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. phaser banks are down to four percent.
i don't know what happened.
you see?
sir?
i don't know you and you don't know me. i made a reasonably polite suggestion. but i'm sure you'd rather be alone.
still worried?
this is barry.
dad.
i've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
i know exactly what you mean.  it's just a feeling.  you know, i could go for some wine tonight.
monstro! ran into walter winchell outside he wants to play herod in the picture. hiya, george.
do as i say. let go!
believe it or not.  it's best for you to pretend that you do.  after all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  that makes you a party to murder.
and by the way, sherman didn't even get laid.
do you have something to say?
has he said when he'll finish?
mmm. part of the master control program?
she's not alone...she's...boyd...oh god...he's gone nuts...he killed lois and micheal...it's all...
where ya going? it's not over yet. we've got one more surprise -- stu, i believe it's your turn.
i thought he was a lame.
so you did fuck up.
no. it's pure bullshit, sweetie. you're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. let's get you a root beer float.
boy, i thought you were about to cross the river.
the kid scores with cheap sentiment.
yeah.
however, it's within my power to grant you a reprieve.  that is why i summoned you here tonight.  tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
you be careful, tommy. don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
of course.
negative helm control, captain! going reverse on impulse power...!
well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
that's bullshit. that's total utter bullshit.
safe and sound, thanks to you. what the fuck was that?
you must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
mother? but your mother --
ain't no mystery to it. she's raised in them shanties off st. luc. dirt--poor.
i don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
naw.  she won't call me.
you mean the shaman?
you'll live like this forever. alone.  you were meant to help.  to be with people.  not like this.
she could buy and sell you ten times over.
oh shut up.  all we did was talk. my attack had nothing to do with him.
ahhhhhhhhh!
what details?  i put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
aye -- i know, las -- and i have never loved anyone more.
you don't know much about much if you think vader won't want us dead before this is over.
you know what you look like?
don't come back, not tonight, not again --
you should be sleeping, baby.
kalen...
he remind you of that guy, tillman?
that will be just about enough! now get out of here!
who?
meet me at my place later.
hardware's too sophisticated.  it's gotta be the government.  and why do i think they're looking for you?
can we rest soon?
oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
it's nice to meet you.  my husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
mother!
hello mrs steckler - we haven't seen you for a long time
some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. i don't blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. you want your women on pedestals. but they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
obviously, the british government denies all of this -
she's crying because she's so happy.
i'm in.
tell her i'm not here, tell her...
what?
no way that cocksucker's driving you.
am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
no, i'm just gonna walk around.
same thing?
yes.  a little girl.
you misunderstood. this man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. he's my patient now and i must do what...
nope.
well, many reasons, actually...
i was getting to it.
all right. but this better be good.
he looks like he can take care of himself.
simon, next door, the charingas' boy.
there's no point both of us getting wet.
sorry. another client paid for that. you can hire me not to use it.
a very convenient guy -- this superintendent. have you checked his bank deposits lately?
what am i doing here?
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some action there.
yes or no, daniel.  if i get him, will you let me go after foley?
i was only talkin' to her.
well, i never had to do it before.
the door was unlocked.
your hot-ass temper.
what?
are you alright?
i don't follow...
hello.
oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. especially when the moon's out.
beggar. we're at a disadvantage with outpost. our experts aren't as smart as theirs. sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. i'm taking a shot in the dark, here. i can offer you 32,000 a year, a buick. i'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
she has all the cooking talent.
we did it, john.  we stopped him.
i was in there in him.
kill someone.  i can't do it.
sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  and second...
and falling in love?
yeah.  i follow you.
just 'cause i ain't got eyes doesn't mean i can't see.
are you okay?
rayette.
yeah. i mean a little, you know.
no ... there is another.
what do you know about classical music?
are you?
how'd you people happen to pop in?
they're crucifying you out there.
what're you ... ? where's sarah? where are the boys?
well i ain't a cop.
when you do this, i swear...
there's porno theatres for that.
not exactly, sir.
i don't know.
come in, mother bird, this is alpha bravo.
hello, aunt theresa.
x marks the spot.
hurry up, for christ's sake!
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
we were just lost, okay?  and we went down this curvy staircase.  at the bottom was a big shadow.
i don't understand.
no, a year ago! where did you live a year ago!!?
i don't write the questions.  i just review them.
when he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
i'll consider it.
has that girl -- has thea ever told you where she comes from?
leave them drums alone.
all right... here's the plan:  first, fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then gwen, alex, fred and i go down to get the sphere.  any of those things come back, give a signal. guy, you set up a perimeter.
you like that?
nothing.
would you leave now, please?
wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? you gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. boy, i wish i was you, boy. waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? what's he want? five thousand down? you're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. a mortgage anna note from the bank. for pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. stay that way, boy. take my advice.
what is this?  the betty ford center?
oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
we?
we already played that game. you lost, remember?

oh, no...
he's not here.  he's not at juvenile hall.  i don't know where he is.  he's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  how old are you?
fuck you.
what? ...jill? jill who? jill who?
how's your arm?
is it you?
why do they have you tied up here?
let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the lord for all this--
what?
applejack would of got him anyway. this was just the quicker way.
i'm sorry.
you will make love to me, won't you, janine? won't you make love to me? you start it. won't you? i think i've forgotten how to start.
i'm sorry about --
what'd you get on w.house?
i better get going.
i was lured by all the money and i truly did convince myself that what i did was for justice. since then, mccay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
yes?
what's the magician's weapon?
did you ever tie him up?
no what?
and another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
i oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
yes i am.
you have to give me your word you won't come in.  then i'll come out.
yes.
i think it's the food of the future.
what's wrong, mother?
yes, i noticed. now suppose -- just suppose -- i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
web's dead.
still, you can't just write her off.
benes' natural defenses. white corpuscles -- antibodies. once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... michaels with all the unknown factors in the body, i still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
some... what does that mean?
that was a footprint. i was standing inside a footprint.
he even got charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
i don't have any aunts - and i've never heard of a 'carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'diedre'!  just who -
twenty minutes?
to help you.  i've run every test known to man.  and they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
you can learn to like it.
how the fuck should i know?  i do know that nothing about it indicates--
what are you thinking?
when i see you. pick me up at sam's. you count the money?
and that's how you want to live your life, is it?
i can't do that for you, red... we need every swinging dick in the field. sorry bout that... 
i didn't stop to take his pulse.
well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
what happened?
...yoha, yoha... yoha.  <i>why</i> albania?
they're saying you killed that policeman.
and if i cut my hair again?
there sure is.
hey, you're the psychic. eve, the psychic pimp.  you tell me.
don't you trust me?
yield. i have the advantage.
what do you mean 'outgrown it'?
yeah?
friends with potential.
at least you were outside.
who's whiskey dick?
yes, isn't it wonderful?  i'm so happy.  i'll bet i'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
z!  over here!
hi. how's the branch manager from kansas city?
did you worry about him?
you know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
ah.
ah-ha. well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
oh. that. rome.
you remember samuel, my son.
i'll be okay. holy shit...
what is this??!
i see two great houses -- house atreides, house harkonnen -- feuding... i see you behind it.
karen. wow. look at you...
you know the man next door is near death.
it's there!
how did you know that?
that means top-secret, cooper.
you said it was urgent.
i need to find my daughter.  i'll pay you.
you just stay put.  you need rest.
...of santa fe."
we all kill ourselves?  bad joke.  sorry, beth.
i have no plans to call on you, clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
wish i could take the credit, but --
i'm clean.
why didn't i?
four!
are you out of your mind?  what on earth'd make us-
sure can. i'd like an invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
wow.  got here just in time.  i brought you this.
perfect, my ass!  --you pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  then richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything i spent a year planning. --frankly, i'm amazed is worked.
where you been?
no time for that. i'll take care of them.
i asked you what you think of rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
yeah...who?
you use words like that, you might make me mad.
okay. i give you my word. is ever'thing gonna be okay? are you all right?
yes. it would be.
put your hand in my pants.
experience, viktor.  i've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  i'm worried about you, that's all.  this woman -- she controls your destiny.
you saved my life, monkeybone. i never would've made it without you.
alright...  i changed my mind.  i'll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side, please.
du lieber gott! how do you look? you had a fight?
accept what's happened, michael.
frances...
but how can he? he'll kill you.
someone should stay with mr. smith.  what if he wakes up?
what the hell would they want with a gag factory?
but --
someone from the past.
hello?
'message from command.  would you like them to send in the hks?'
'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. lock them all away forever. no political risk, and big publicity.' that's what he said.  i thought i'd better tell you.
well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
shoulda' felt up tammy in the pool, that time...
no one's ever asked me that before.
you know harry lied about how that boy hocker got kilt. and it was harry who saw emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
nobody chickened.
i'm afraid you have to eat something.
the whole thing is my fault. i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. you understand me.
it ain't even three years we been married.
have you decided?
listen to what i say --
i can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, i think about back home, back home at malibu. i used to surf a lot, talby. i used to be a great surfer.
a jail?  prison?
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week, jack, and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian ... now, if this indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
i don't want to move. but somebody has to move sometime. eventually.
i'm sure.  he's dead.
she is an innocent.
well, except for the one girl.
and he'll need a cyclotron.  he can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard.  new haven, long island, two in cambridge--
what?
fifty-seven.
what is that?
wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
yeah.
i'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. and i'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to mr. haller.
forget it's there.
i'd better go on home now, it's late. i have to work tomorrow.
and who else did i find? agent thomas mackelway, crackerjack fbi techie. i was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
how come it feels the same?
how long until we reach the rift?
why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was principal collins?
amazing how?
come on, ray. come forward.
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory?
what? and get the clap?
want to buy a bed?
we'll make you better.  we can put the pieces back.  we can do that.
you know i can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
he came in four minutes ago.
in case of what?
sometimes.
i bet you're a damn good poker player.
the man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. he lost control and is capable of doing it again.
i mean...wow...off the charts great.
it is now nine o'clock precisely. i do not intend to be kept waiting again.
only what's on the menu...  a number two: plain omelette. it comes with cottage fries and rolls.
how'd you get around the tap orders?
where did he go?
mef?  what's mef?
no, not yet.
they took the phones...
bob's in a hurry.
and that is?
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
where have you been?
you don't have to do this. we could just cut out of here, go to akron,  or anywhere else.
no, i'm leavin' this mornin', back up to brainerd.
that's right.
can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
probably as small as mandrake falls.
it's 12th century. from deauville -- in france.
huh?
hey.
penrhyndeudraeth, north wales.
but why didn't he just follow her to fiji?
so, you live around here.
so start at the beginning...
just tell 'em -- now and then.
now, amy --
look, harry's not part of this. he's just a sales rep.
the pentagon?  i didn't know i had friends in washington.
do you wish it, jack?  wish you this our wedding band?
...the night batman was born.  what was i doing in the fields that night, alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember.
and...you know jan gruner?
i was bewitched... it's better this way...
you better hurry. the police will be here any second.  i don't really understand my motivation with this. why am i washing glasses?
how?  how?  she hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. give me a miracle.
all them miners last century. hungry ghosts, killed off all the indians. up at the mine. earth ran red with blood, think i'm fooling around here. white sky was on fire. grown men cried like babies. i saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. they put me in the joint. took my eyes. i cursed them. white people can't seem to stay away from indians . you gotta watch where ya put your fingers. pussy pussy pussy, indian pussy.
well, i thought you understood and i was just missing it.
wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
we cannot go into this later.
jesus, man ... what'd you do?
she's a bird, willow.
that's not compliment, melvin... that's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid... a compliment is something nice about somebody else... now or never.
hello, max, hildy johnson. was there an old lady --?
murdered...? how?
-- it hasn't been two years --
was this all about the oil?
what if i did?
i guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
how old am i?
see your son, huh? well, that's nice. a side of you i didn't know, lilly.
whitney armstrong, my deputy. what whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian...
john.  john...
i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn.
i was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  but i don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
she was good in bed, though.
do you love drew?
watch out sid. randy said the killer's always superhuman.
excuse me, missus, can you please help? there's been a terrible accident. can i please use your telephone for an ambulance?
man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  he will soon be extinct.  it's time, it's time.
first, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which i would like to have returned to me.
hello marylin.
hey! -
scottie!
it isn't going to make it ellen. let the poor thing go quietly.
perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
i've arranged with those people we saw at hau fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
daddy, it can't be just because of that.  there had to be other factors.
your husband! mrs. robinson! there's something we could have a conversation about.
been drinkin' a bit, have we?
sit down, this is almost over.  you follow the baseball games?
no. i mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
you're going to take me back?
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny what i have spoke: but farewell compliment! dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say 'ay,' and i will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, thou mayst prove false. o gentle romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
where what?
you know.
that puts us right here... which means we can head straight for the sub arachnoid cavity.
aaron was in the dream.  a dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york?
are you an actress?
i know perfectly well how little i can do. what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
yeah. no more. i'm finished with that shite.
eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
you guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
but... you've done so much for god as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for jeanne?
no, ma'am, we can't. we can get a roof and a fire and maybe mrs. wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty. we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
who told you that?
i don't care.  load me a deck.  set it up for threes and nines.  i'll cut it in on his deal.
i said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
how am i gonna sell things if nobody comes by? this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin' much.
admiral, i've got to take the mains off the line. the energizer's shaken loose and i can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
what's going to happen?
by then it's too late! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! the chemicals will break down and dissipate!
what is this thing?  a fighter?
and?
patrick, let's just get through this. we have a long night ahead of us.
what can i do for you?
polacks and deadbeats.
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. like some?
what?!
never mind. forget it.
recognize this?
sorry.
roger, cougar.  okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
how -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
how old are you?
what are you getting at?
where's your manners? make room for homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
the one in your office? it's the best one for naps.
i don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
what was it?
are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
what's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
it wasn't a lunatic.
so tell me when i ain't done it.
this is our attorney, gerta rauss.
of course.  we had to try.  we didn't know what was wrong.  we didn't know you were in trouble.
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady, i humbly apologize--
a fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
you were convicted of the crime.
i gotta go meet kelly for a drink downstairs. she wants to talk about some photo thing.
all right, all right. now calm down, rose, the children will hear you. calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
got a license?  but no car?
chaperone. i'm waiting for my dinner date.
no, that's enough. i just wanted you to get the idea. now you know. this house is haunted.
who was that?
isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
pomona!  you'll be in the car the whole time...look, let's make this easy.  i have a spare bedroom.  it's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
sold in marriage and half way to america.
good day, mister adams... george, what's the word from boston?
mr. treves! treves.
i'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
so?
see! that shimmering area.
no.  what are you gonna do?
what's a revival tent?
why?
that's his headache.
i don't know what to say to allah.
alright, i want a complete workup on her.  do we know where she is?
couldn't get on the boat.  i'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  and skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
where you think you're going?
and -- and --
and the baby?
let's not jump to conclusions.  this egg could belong to any number of reptiles, dr. frock.
...gger.
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
how ya gettin' out, mac?
we can't stay here.
people watched the movies in their cars?
okay.  what do you do when you don't have a witness?
her body turned up. in a minnesota cemetery. they brought her back.
sir, what is it? there's something you're not telling me.
it's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
gary cooper.  and barbara stanwyck. yowsa.
<u>no</u>.
rise...and...shine...!
nick?... i just want to say how sorry i am about sal and about merle. how... i know you loved them and i know it's not the same. i mean now.
phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. but the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
oh, there you are!
what did you do today satan?
i know where he's coming from. the only thing i really don't get is why he dumped you. up until i found that out, i thought his judgment was pretty sound.
faster, faster!
on a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
what happened?  what happened?
how are you feeling, young man?
i'm not going to curse.
mimi!
huh?  no, she, she hit me right here.
i would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away?
then maybe you can read mine.
the other families won't sit still for all out war.
what?
jack, you're wrong.
of course.
maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
yeah... mmmm, that sounds good... uhu...
and if you've got cold feet honey, ill take over for you. that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
does it have to be an old mill?  where have you been?
i'm no expert, but i'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
no. they're not your team. they're my team.
pal, you're cooked. it's over. what you did, who you were...that's done. i'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
which one is it?
i don't think so.  i'm busy thursday night.
getting there.
...shit!!  we'd found him. we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
hey, i gotta give the guy credit. he does the most obvious thing. this is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  so... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the strip trying to copy off him.
your dead friend jack?
they won't let it out. not hearst. not the other studio heads--
big ringo fan.
congratulations, ensign mayo, sir!
hon?
get married. have a wedding.
that's the engineering containment. and there's the main airlock. we can dock there.
don't worry about it.  just get into bed.  worry about that when you're better.
yes --?
okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
smells like tuna number two to me.
why do you keep coupling me with falco?
and if the police stop by - what do i tell them?
there’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
would you like to sit on my lap?
what brings you out here...
i think he's got a point.
troughed off. protected. like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
i haven't worn mine in months.
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --
oh --
let me guess:  wonderland weather.
make what?
do you mind if i sit down?  what about the blue one?
from hurley's?
now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.
can't they shut that off?
stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
no way. no thanks. i can't do it --
if cornwallis receives news that clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  he'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
how're these?
they weren't loaded when i put them in there!
what are you looking at?
i'm sorry, michael.  senator geary's here, and mr. and mrs. barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  won't you join us, mr. ola?
yeah, man. let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
faith, this is my mother.
if you don't eat that ice cream right now, i'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
housekeeping.  i come to turn down the bed.  5:00, i turn down the bed.
yeah. this is it. i have some shopping to do.
what about the body you found?
townsend believed, just as god became man in christ.  so satan will assume human form.  i believe it too.
did it hurt?
you didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, grady?
i realise all that, missus, and i'm very grateful to all concerned.
get out.  out!
if this is a joke, i'm not laughing.
at what?
i can't kill this kid's father...
in detroit. this weekend.
i'm so scared...
i came in from my room...
i'm afraid it may storm.
i'm her father!
...i just don't know what... to do–
as for the author... shoot him.
i'm looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, i'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.
what happened to clarence and...?
i bet.  a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
not that much appreciation. i thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
you're rude . . . rude and insolent! i don't see why i should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
listen...thank you.
the engines!
yeah, i got ya. i don't see anything inside though.
where are you?
responsibility, progress.
stuttering stanley! stuttering stanley!
what's your point?
you were the new and improved you.
what's wrong?
well, they must be something sexual, because ann gets freaked out by that shit. are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
willingham, when he tossed his cell, took polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
i know. we're checking every cellular account in the county. any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross-referenced. it's gonna take time but we'll find him.
am i supposed to feel better? like, right now?  or do i have some time to think about it?
i observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
can i come in?
the klingon, the romulan, the federation consuls. now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
guess i'm sick of wearing masks ...
stay with me tonight.  not because you're being paid to. stay with me because you want to.
extra money, huh?
[line of dialogue cut off]
fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  how you gonna get a boat?
a book of delusions.  anything else?
a long time ago...
if you get caught, i never saw you. deal?
yeah.
but --
did you say we saved ninety white people?
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
very good, brian. -- about your report here. the way to a torch's heart is through his tools. that's how you know him. it's the way he talks to the fire. and to you if you listen.
c'mon bill... you've got some sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
you can talk while i drive us to the police.
it's not quite the face you remember.
who did this?
i'm smarter than looseleaf.
no!  nothing happened.
you're living at home now. is that right?
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission –– i mean –– might i perhaps win my wings? i've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
ah, good. new acquisitions. you are a protocol droid, are you not?
the second most powerful man is robert haldeman. just below him are a trio: mr. erlichman is haldeman's friend, and they protect the president from everybody which is why they are referred to as either the german shepherds or the berlin wall. mr. mitchell we've already discussed. mr. colson is the president's special counsel.
please.
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
to washington bartholomew hogwallop. from his loving cora. ay-more fie- dellis.
so what are ya drawin'?
oh my god.  aw, god.
the conference is at camp khitomer, near the romulan border. i'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
fifty percent.
wait till i get going! where was i?
why not just bring the whole toilet?
what was going on in the courtyard the other day?
you have to think about this, sal. listen to me, sal! you have to think about this.
sounds boring. are there any songs?
i want it to have my children!
i've never been in an apartment above a store.  you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
...i don't know.  tell her you had to see her.  tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. sweet talk the woman.  a young buck like you must be good at that.  then ... maybe shift the conversation.  get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  she loves that thing.  maybe the only thing she does love. she'll want to take you for a ride.
you left her.  how's that for a fact?
were you recently promoted?
a thumb? what do you mean, like cut it off? for ten bucks?  that include the tip?
this is work.
have i got things to tell you!
you ever hear about the oranges?
yeah.  with money like rockefeller, and shoulders like johnny weismuller -
then what do you want to do, miles? run?
giron...!
what am i looking for?
shame about the kid. seems a lively sort.
pritchett: what is going on?
dad!
you were! you *are*! it was fantastic.
nothing personal.
i don't need you to get the money -- my money!
didn't i tell you, she dumped me monday night.
all right then, if i have to go to school then i'd better go.
anything i can do for you?
when?
i'll see what i can do.
who's been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?
no, no, i love that. i'd want it to be in german. i haven't done anything in german since seraglio.
you like this? walkin' me through this field like i's your mule?
i'm on my way, starck.
she broke up with her boyfriend.  listen, babe, we needja back. you gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
what's the problem, what's the problem here?
they buried my ma & pa and my sisters. and chingachgook - who found me with two french trappers - raised me up as his own.
then don't come any closer.
well, uh...  you're what grammy hall would call a real jew.
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe's club and his house, wade ran into buddy deeds. i think buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car and drove him out by the army post, i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
i'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, fergus?
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  that's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  get them on your side, it's like buying manhattan for beads.  with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world.
i believe you would have.  another fall, i did seven years at lompoc.  and i don't mean the place next door where some of nixon's people went.
i think that's about the time i fell asleep.
terrific.
not yet.
but first, you have to start with the clothes!
you don't look comfortable here. that's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? nah. you're like me.
yes.
maneuvering thrusters, mister sulu.
i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
did you do it for tim?
what did you do?
so one of them got to him.
you've got dirt on your hands and everybody understands you're no good
where are they?
so is the woman.
he's a jerk. i never noticed it before. seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . .  . . . maybe you think the same thing about me. that's why you keep avoiding me.
sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
i'll take it out of their skulls.
what can i do for you folks?
i don't know who you are or where you come from, but i don't like you. you ask too many questions.
i want my mommy.  i don't want to lose you, clem.
where do you think this goes?
ok. escape route. the most important thing you can have is an escape route. just in case somebody's tailing us. or even chasing us, as the case may be --
when you are ready.
payne.
here, mom.
when was that?
good luck.
he knows where i work.
oona?  do you suppose it's a faerie?
oh, jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
oh, that's nice, louis.  i'll stop by if i'm around.
not really.
swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
they all have names and numbers on them. i wonder what they are?
-- ruth rabinow, this is rex rexroth. and you must be mrs. rexroth.
that's natural.
the access code to your mainframe.
listen, hannah. you don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? james' aunt.
well, if it's nothing, then why do i have to go into the hospital at all?  i mean, uh, i hear perfectly fine, so i'm, so i'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  so i, you know, i won't go to the opera.
spock!
oh, i wasn't worried about that.
tim?
everything under control?
may i help you?
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  you're just gonna have to pick me up later.
well, i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
share this with no one.
the answer is no.
but what do they want?  where are we going?
fight what?
but happy. very happy, peggy sue.
i see.  then who is after you?  what sins have you committed?
i told you! i told you i saw a --
i'll just hold onto it for you.  in case they check.
that was the plan, we meet here.
nor i!
what the hell are you doing there?
thank you, alma.
speak of the devil.
what's your twenty?
i'm sorry we got you into this, tommy.
jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
hello, ralph. how'd you make out with those nurses last night, ralph?
come on, what's under this?
there's no catch. this is on the up and up. of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by anne schuyler's husband.
for nicholai?
what are we doing?
oh, you feel very good, betts. you have such a cosy body. i'm jealous, i'm so skinny.
how do you know?  they might.
it doesn't matter, mr crane.
i saw that look on your face just now. what's between you and wyatt?
i heard you were looking for this.
grandma?
if i expected somethin', i wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
hello, there. who are you?
i want my wife.  i told you and told you. now i'm gettin' tired of this shit--
i know.
get up!
there's a dip at this end. and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
stephen ready?
this was before her pregnancy?
she must be something special after dark.
charlie, i'm from the old country, and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses?
director?
what are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a sunday this year, what can we do?
you are married?
what are you saying?
it's dr. furtwängler's baton, which i stole.
man, you play like a kokonut. you got to call him at least.
what can i do for you, gentlemen?
then tell me how.
i love somebody.  all the time i've been looking for someone to love me and now--i love somebody.  and it's so easy.  why is it easy now?
they've changed their heading again.
o.k.
we ran up against a platoon of soldiers. there were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
i look familiar?
to us!
a mystery.
dewey my god i thought you were dead.
why?
all right. the check will be certified. want my fingerprints?
tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi. dumford, kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support pulleine. mr vereker will join you as adc. do you understand me clearly?
i carried the king's child!  the queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
it's cold.
yes you do.  something's on with you.  you're sleeping with her, aren't you?
she got it, bob.  a nineteen-year-old college kid ...
you don't seem to understand.
should we stop?
'course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
you have to tell us now.
oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, becky -- bring it on.
it's me.
so did i.
danny?!  danny!
the key!? she has the lost key!?
damned if i can keep her out of my equations.
can't we get rid of them?
but without your brothers.  nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies.  you may explore the continent.
why? here is the music. it's here. i am submitting it humbly. isn't that what you wanted?
maurice?
nervous? scared? worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
that the atmosphere processor?
i see.
you want to bet?
you're in gun country now, my friend.
terminate ?
let's go overseas . . .
hello...
how we doing, colonel?
ten years ago? let's see...  ...yes. i was having a brace put on my teeth. where were you?
put your pilot on.
i hope you're pretty nearly through with me, doctor, i'm getting a little fatigued.
can you?  you damn well better be. jesus, if i hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if i'd been totally honest, i wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless i was cleaning it. but that's no reason for you not to be. honest, i mean.  not cleaning the pool.
what you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
if cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
lord!  put the baby in the icebox. killed the poor thing.
how?
... so what does all that add up to?
my sister's a friggin' loser.
doesn't matter.
let's forget that we ever met.
even if money wasn't an issue, dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
highliner.
she told you about...
ask him.  i don't know.
god damn it, jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
fuck you too, you rotten whore!!
oh, buddy-boy. i was just about to call you.  i'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. you see, my little friend, she kept insisting picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but i'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
so, did you find my dad?
now tell me you love me.
hmmm....
cancel? but it's her birthday -- i already ordered the cake --
but you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? i'm worried that you did this because...
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell.
you didn't cook breakfast?
absolutely.  and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall.
you really don't act like a scientist.
i had to get in, to meet margo! i had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
so how would you put it?
so you'll have some later.  notice anything...different?
rizzo pull the fucking lever!
wendy?
and you, are you in love with any one else?
who asked you?
computers.  that's how you got into homesearchers records.  you can get into anything.  but why?  why?
no, i am.  yes, i'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning.  i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and mr. wayne's hoped-for investment... i've studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and --
would you like to meet him?
where'd the road go?
are you saying that he's...
you can't print that!
cute.
you’d better get going. my parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
that'd be great.
that's right?
tell me!
what do you do anyway?
he saw us at tammany hall.
would you sign it for me?
young adult.
keep enough tension to hold him up, hector, we don't know if he can swim.
you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up, i know we got set up! i mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? one minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. i didn't hear any sirens. the alarm went off, okay. okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. all loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  you haven't thought about this?
it's a house.
but what was a hair dresser from malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
why would anyone do this?
thought you wrote you had a mustache.
give us your money.
hello, i'm roger delacorte - the head librarian.  are you the men from the university?
he's...he's very nice.  but mrs. carver, the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands. please, you have to help me.
like i would have art in my suitcase.
what do you say we send a bottle over?
what do you mean "don't worry?"
it's tommy! they got tommy!
....i'm not exactly sure what that means...
how am i gonna do that?
like your story is over.
the honors of war?
that's okay.
i wish there was a way to bring them back home.
not in a cab...  i mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
getting the yard all fixed up for your party, amy. you'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
i'd like to begin.
ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
listen to me! we don't have much time. we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
'is it really me?'
sweetheart...i know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  okay?
i'm recording this.
listen to me i --
i am mad at you! and at landon! and the universe! and god!  i don't even know where to put all my anger.
they're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, gabe.
hello.
well, how'll i get home?
feel what? you okay?
she was willing to lick the stamps.
give it to her, dad.  it'll make her happy.
do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? this is tiring me.
in the abstract maybe. get a grip on yourself! but when i imagine you going out with other guys, i feel... ah...
yeah?
it'll never hurt you---got any money?
he was waiting for you, sir. wait- ed a good while. said he'd go down and take a look. i hope that's o.k.
i never....
walk away? andy, you can't be serious. how can i walk away? don't you see what's goin' on here? don't you see what's at stake?
you don't believe in anything, do you?
forget it.
that's stupid.
you're begging him to kill you?
we had a leak in the bathroom. he fixed it.
not just juanito. you'll have it good too, esperanza. we're going to win this strike.
my bike!  she's a lesbian, too. she told me.
...i'm at least half a bum. yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. the roughest part is the mornin' after.
nothing.
where did you get this?
no, jennifer love hewitt. of course it's me, silly. and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
this is a brutal layoff...and all because they couldn't program wednesdays.
i'll wait for you...i'm proud of you. i'll <u>be</u> waiting.
boring.
we can, can't we? trust you?
k-r-o-one.
can you love a player?
hello. you there
we might.
i thought you'd missed the train.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
let's make a little music, colorada.
no? well, i disagree. i think they did. i think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? makes me sick.
what do you-?
so what do you want?... an autograph.
thank you.
i bet you have a great family.
sam's piano.
fine. what's, uh, what's on your mind?
what's wrong with that?
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and i'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
who's persecuting? she stole!
you're not?
hi. oh, hi. hi.
how long ago was your makeover?
meeks is probably in rio or someplace like that by now.
rinka.
then i'd ask you what your terms are.
no you're not.
really?
whose place is this again?
i think we'd better have a look.
when i get back i'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
what you talkin' about, luke? we're together, you and me, just like always. now the thing we gotta work out is how to get koko outa there and then the terrible trio be all complete again. man, this old free world ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
i guess not.
parry, it's lydia sinclair - our membership winner.
ohh!
and you... are you not also afraid?
di, are you okay?  we can skip the girl party this week.
what does?
well, i mean, she always answers her beeper.
i don't mean to be a prick, but that's how i feel.
shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
i don't like your following me.
you had me worried to death!
but i never know when you're working and when you're not working!
reed said it'd be weeks till --
goodbye, darling.
and you get of from school at 3 every day?
well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
okay, stay.  we'll come back for you.
i'm leonard shelby, i'm from san francisco and i'm -
you got any money?
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
that's right. but you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. and i'd like to have it!
shit, i'm sorry.
that's hard to believe. the two of you seem so different.
how about a "man in jeopardy" story?
we've got pressure.
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  you know what you get? more bark.  and more bark.  there's no core.  tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  and now they can't get rid of them.  they've tried poisons. nothing works.  they don't die.
i think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
and you're in love overnight?
he killed her.
sha la la la that ain't no crime.
yeah.  so where's the high school?
across the street a great western. it goes in a trust account. you'll need to fill out an application for appearance bond, an indemnity agreement, a contingent promissory note. that's the one, if beaumont skips and i go after him, you pay the expenses.
you sure?
you really think i should forget her?
and you get the mayor off my back with this zoning crap. nobody tells me how to run my property.
am i interrupting something?
i didn't say this wasn't the shark, i just said i wasn't sure this was the one...
we need to make the trade tomorrow.
i know where he goes.
what are you talking about?
buggin' out, i gotta work here.
maybe these are not men - not like us.
what's that mean?
does bella come here?
i'm right?
lucky for me you were wandering about. thank you again. i've been terrible bother to you.
you know i can't.
which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  these are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
i get final approval. it's in my contract.
something was rattling around. some loose tools.
i fell in love. after that, i never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. i never saw it like i was losing some other life, just felt like i was gaining one. i know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and i ain't saying it's the right one. we all have to find the life meant for us.
i could work the pit maybe, but i could never drive like dale ernhart--
are you a friend of mitch's?
i'm not making any promises.
mr. reed would like you to call him.
there's a sanctuary... there is!
how's it going, ray?
i love you, will, beyond poetry.
how'd she meet patchett?
touche.
okay, but i'm worried about the next pms bout. it's gotten worse. i'm not myself during it. i get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and i have more facial and body hair.
take us up.
but i'm not on the outside. i'm in here.
get them in the lab!
no wonder zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. he's planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family.
no, dad.
you can trust him...
yeah. come on.
come on, ma.
wait. slow down. a film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. it's like it doesn't even exist.
oh - nothing. no extra charge.
do you bite your thumb at us? sir.
uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
there's an old saying, "first customer of the day is always the most trouble!" but like i said, i'm in no mood for it so i'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
hello?
oh no--he's shaking off the sign, jackson.  big mistake...
mental instability?
unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and kendra handle the cops.
me. my home number is on this card.
it's our road kill series.  i take the pictures.
got a reason to stay.
why not?
where you goin', honey?
really.
it's crucifying him--!
no.
no, i don't.  he happens to deserve the credit.  he's right here.
you fuck me, then snub me.  you love me, you hate me.  you show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, tyler?
now don't get nervous.  it's just your husband.
hello?
of course.
under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
look at me. look at what they gave me to wear.
but you played the big con.  you said it was nothin'.  a game for flakes and mama's boys.
jack - - please - - wipe that lunatic grin off your face.
nothing. i'm fine.
you don't drink like you used to.
yeah?
when?
huh! who do you think we are, mr lombard?
yeah. i mean. a little, . you know.
god, if he doesn't come back --
what a...jerk!
you're kidding me.
what i'm saying, they're getting some help.
me? willie long.
my friend, you tink greta is first woman i ever see?  no!  many duds, before i find her.
what happened?
it's a trap. there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it's just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
there's no standing between a fool and his folly. if you must babble your news to him he's at the fisherman's tryst. it's the inn at pennycuik. you can use macfarlane's horse and gig to get there. he'll welcome the ride back.
what's the matter?
you look awful.
good.
what's the matter with you? you want to be killed?
i've been working on this poem for 12 years.
i'm scared.
yeah?
where are we going?  you know i hate surprises.
you open?
you'd love to prove that. getting your name in the national geographic.
juno? did you happen to barf in my urn? mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one i got up in stillwater? i found some weird blue shit, i mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
what did you say?
i've finished for the evening.  will you be needing anything else?
boys, boys...
-- and the courage that you promised cowardly lion?
that's *it*?
clean.
but -- how'd you know it was mine?
he just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
don't be coy.  i've always known about your feelings for each other. all these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. you're both wasting precious time.
delivered from swedish furniture.
yes, sir. you wouldn't believe it.
that's how i ruined my stomach.
i was thinking las vegas.  get some butts in those seats.
for _me_? really? tell me.
quickly, close it.
...where is my pill?
oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
oh, my dear boy, i'm sorry. that's impossible. why, i have my classes all started.
but this invitation came from the empress herself! it's the social event of the decade! you can't turn it down!
whiskey!
go right over there.
yes, i did -- but you tricked me into signing it! you told me my soul was nothing ... that i could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. that was a lie, a lie, a lie.
a zillion, huh? that's a lot.
oh, i can explain about that later. you're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
the evidence of what?
shocking, huh?
night.
you idiot!
and get a doctor.
i want your best man on this!
james...
after we eat, dad.
what about the mayor?
do i get a country-western name?
jake, don't go out there. call the sheriff.
would you shut the hell up with that shit? it's not helping.
so were you.
sobek.  half man, half croc, oldest god--
where to?
not much here. jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
there's no reason.
sorry.
that's fine.  we've got some new things to teach them.
fax these to this number, okay?
that's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. lord wessex was looking at you tonight.
who's heller?
but morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. therefore, she's not immoral. not really.
okay. we'll get the money together. don't worry about it, jerry. now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
that's all swell.  only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. i've got nothing to do with it.
what are you looking for? lie, and i'll slit your throat.
this is so fucked, solomon. i don't deserve this.
i think i would like that drink.  i'll give you your christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
you don't listen very good.  this break in -- i can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  or i could see it gets forgotten.
dad, when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist. mr. franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. he said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
we'll refuel in the bahamas.  i know someone there.
so do i...
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from ripley, understand?  how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
now?
you too, mom.
fuck it!
so he has no idea what's about to happen?
get the next plane.
just a tip.
do not seek the treasure!
jesus.
there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
who's camille?
who is closer to the wall, joey or me?
colonel mathieu ... much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... can you tell us something about this?
hey, can i borrow this?
there's always a chance they'll confess.
it's so very cold...
certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
what do you want, mr... cunningham, was it?
just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him einstein.
mrs. torrance, i don't think you have anything to worry about.  i'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny.
is that good?
i see it before me.
kiss me.
sooner or later that's everybody.
yes.
mrs. mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
the captain...
lord wessex, as i foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. it's time to settle accounts.  how much was the wager?
well... you could always dump her, mr. bebe. teach her a lesson. there are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
nobody's ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard.
how do you know i made it up?
amnesia.
i— i musta counted wrong, boss, i—
yeah, i see her.
no!  oh no!  three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! the police won't even go in there any more.
but yourself?  what about john brown?
i'll be a few minutes.  wait here --
gee, i don't know, crabs. i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
mom's home?...
who brought me in here?
which is ridiculous. boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
the washington post.
what a hell cat. no controlling these modern girls.  they're terrible!
lois, i don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
oh, everything is so wonderful! it's getting farther and farther away!
i am father vogler. i am a chaplain here. i thought you might like to talk to someone.
how is it?
you know who that is?
it's his heartbeat.
what?!
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann --
you're a dark horse, ripley. engaged?
well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
it's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
different how? different like a dwarf at a basketball game? or different like a lesbian in pumps?
it's a plain end. i think.
we tried to be.  we tried to be.
you ready...?
i want that bastard dead!
it's simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
a price on everything.
what's that?
this is the last time i expect to see you down here.
no!  good night!
so who you taking to the prom?
amtrack?
with a twist of my wrist ... you're turned over ...
the sawbones?
eight and twenty-four.
what are you going to do?
she is a wild, twisted bitch.  stay away from that one.
i'm bored, and so are the kids.
how careful should i be?
you can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  everyone you ever bump into will know.  'well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
i don't want to talk about it...
forget rekall, will you!  these men were going to kill me...
your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. that's your problem, pal.
it's a mosquito bite.
i've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
make yourself at home, mister mcmurphy...
and that, of course, would be me.
what...amulet?
hello, natalie -- guess who? that's right, and you know everyday i say to myself, today could be the day... so what do you say... will you marry me? then please can you get me through to mr. gekko?
you just worry about yourself, james. okay?
...he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
you know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
i got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
i can't see anything in here!
an historical moment, gentlemen.
guess who?
maybe.
john, how are you?
that's a train, son. don't stand in front of them.
i could've.  but he didn't want me to.
i am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. we can think with each other, think for each other. i can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. running someone else's brain.
halloween is coming, soon.  you will have top dollar if you watch for me at the showtime, tomorrow night.
no. i understand perfectly.
say that again, son.
oh, i'm sorry. how'd your folks take it?
front page.  washington post.  tomorrow.
what a joke...
kelly.  is suzie there?
why don't you just shove it up your ass!  haw-haw!
so -- mag -- you've seen this, huh?
are you all right?
it's maria portos. what should we do?
you're a musician?
you've been there?
you know that's probably not the best idea. i'll just wait to see them in the store.
bud...
oh ellie.  it's so beautiful.  it's the most beautiful thing i ever saw.
our doctors are seen by appointment only.
that's the rub.
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
and if i didn't <u>know</u> better - i'd swear we were moving!
if i stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? or are you ready to go all the way?
it's all fixed!  osgood is meeting us on the pier -
i plan on getting a lot older. and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
just an admirer...
maybe he didn't like us.
there are no...headquarters. there are no...rebels. only the walking dead. don't you see. they have won.
so -- are you making any new year's resolutions?
i'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
discouraging, isn't it? women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
we got kittykat...
is that for mitch brenner?
or maybe you just think you do.  you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
and then it will be too late. the goal of evil is to wipe out life! all forms of life. for all eternity...life upsets it.
but professor --
thing is, dil, you're not a girl.
i'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
oh, please.
wander separately? ah, but only one is a wanderer. two, together, are always going somewhere.
all right, then. here's the deal. total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
so --  i hope you like it.
12000 feet.  jesus, i don't believe he's doing this.
like...ah...
i didn't say that.
get it out of here!
dad, i talked to the track coach--
so tonight she confesses?
i am so sick of being right.
charlie, it's just no go.  we can't agree anymore.  i wish you'd let me go to chicago.
i'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
i believe you won decorations during the war.
does it hurt?
memento pink revisions - 9/7/99 85.
i was playing naked.
what's your shot in all this?  being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level i think it ....
can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on mary?
we've stuck it out for a whole week now... pretty girl.
nothing, man.
poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
the wasps were meant for michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  why would you hurt him...?!  answer me.
i don't want to leave you.
how much money have you got?
i know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata. not bad at all.  are you expecting someone?
they said she was just rags, like somebody -
well give me a reasonable explanation
stay where you are.
you mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
i don't even know a jew who'd have the balls to say that. so let's get this straight. you never ever tip?
here what comes?
you're leaving, aren't you?
of course. of course. of course he does. of course. thank you. thanks.
what-are you?  a fucking moron? it's three o'clock in the morning, frank.  who's watching?  your wife? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank's birthday party. what do you think?
keep ben's for awhile, okay?  until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
there's definitely something going on in that studio.  the pke levels were max-plus and the giga-meter was showing all red.
fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
what do we do if there isn't?
mmmmmmmmm!
you got a date already?
all in yellow?  oh!  that was my father!
a game?
your name?
that's a good thing?
sheila, you're going to far! those are your children!
were you longe range recon --
that's a start.
somewhere in this city.  not here, not here.  tell penelope i loved her--in my clownish way.  and paul. tell him to be a healer, by all means.
could work with a new switch. there may be a few more things hidden.
may i have this dance?
yes.
trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  if we re-enter over mexico, we just might make it.
and all his works?
you like mysteries that much?
captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere i have seen him.
i'm not kidding.
what is it with crack and transsexuals?
don't shit where you eat.
prince leopold?  is he the one who bleeds all day?  so what does his valet do?  wash his poultices for him?
so what does this thing do?
could i do that later?
no need lie, boy.  i no hurt you. do i look like i wanna hurt you?
i done it all. i've done an' seen everything'. believe what i'm tellin' ya -- ya shoulda seen the night in brooklyn, i smacked 'ginny' russo outta the ring, september 14, 1923 -- same night firpo knocked dempsey outta the ring. but who got the press? he did. he had a manager -- september 14, 1923.
you and i know about this -- and that's where it stops.  understand?  it never happened.
i just fried stinky. tell father i'll be home. he shouldn't wait up.
frank.
and what if i didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
you know, i don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... one time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... so sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
just like i always promised.  now you're among the immortals.  you're movie stars.
how can you not like the top 10 list?
i'm afraid i don't understand.
hear, hear...
you should have let me do the talking.
because i really suspect gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
how much?
just like this.
sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
don't help me.
you are so money, and you don't even know it...
we've got to take this slow...
hmm? is that a professional opinion?
big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that i don't think is going to make it.
d'artagnan!
got a bogey, boss?
what's a toby?
you ok?
can i help you?
right there in liberty city. and you were right, she's really something.
maybe you inspire me.
this is crazy. no one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
i don't feel anything.
what ya want?
is your husband with you?
oh, baby, what's going on?
so uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
why do you get to choose?  why don't i get to choose?
you think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  understand something: i am the real gibarian.  just a new incarnation.
... oh? you've heard?
what did you tell the people?
i think he has his own plan, uncle lex.
see, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
will you mind your own business!
i know, i know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
make it up to me, then.
it's gonna be hot today.
take this flare.
you alright?
central pumping.  all the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
i was.
could we move a little faster?
he hardly knew of them him- self.  i believe it was his uncle in australia.
my number's going to show up on his bill!
i'm alive.
see? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i didn't want any of them. you... you're what i want. understand?
what about betelgeuse?
why?
benjie!
and he said most of them are college guys, i've never met or seen.
it's not your fault. we appreciate you trying.
we been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
we know that you weren't.
oh c'mon, i love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause peter needed a kidney.
but what are we paying him for?
did you ever see her again? 
how much did you say it was, tom?
i've come to a decision.
am i? 92 92    int. hallway - fiftieth floor
wait a minute -
i said i'd consider it. nobody owns me. and the last thing was insane. i don't know what's wrong with him... no magazines.
how much?
you're just saying nothing!  tonight is the night.
i've been trying to reach you. you're tougher to get than the president.
you all right, pop?  you want me to drive you?
what does this mean?
excused.  open the cabinet to your left. you will find appropriate attire.
don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
putt-putt golf?
please, sir.
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention?
kate, is something the matter?
you can both go take a flying jump.
about the gale girl, i mean. where do we go from there? what of it?
has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
what did you do in asia? is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
yes, mr. zorg, i hear you perfectly! so, how was the concert?
hello? yes this is mrs. macneil. operator you have got to be kidding i have been on this line for twenty minutes.  jesus christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
is there only one charles lampert?
nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. crafty old sod.
no game.
it's okay.
i've never really noticed. is renata going with you?
patience, my friend. in time he will seek you out. and when he does, you must bring him before me. he has grown strong. only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force.
what?
what did you think then?
but he's the head of ingen!
who's that guy?
one question, doctor, please!  you can't do this! i'm the press, i have rights!!
it's the only way to play.
you're rachel lapp, aren't you?
lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
quick, let me have that money. i'm broke and i'll need it for tips.
i've got to go.
...upset and impressionable...  get me the mayor...
excuse me???
i can't be nice to a fan?
what the hell is that, anyway?
did you kill ilio manzetti?
didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
what is it?
look. you were really high. things happen.
did you say formal? i must dress.
i asked you how you like your coffee...? we have black and bitter.  as the soul of man.  or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
i was just taking a walk before dinner.
what is that?
i didn't know what else to call you.
rapidamente! everybody in the world is going to see!
hey, i'm wanting a bet put on.
do you like that?
thank you, sir.
i mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
but of course you are. dinner at eight.  wouldn't miss it.
i wanted to. i thought we could make it.
got a little action there, eh buddy?
no, i don't think you do. and besides... i haven't decided yet.
but, senor--
i -- i -- i... don't...
darling, it's good riddance. let her go. and while you're at it, fire that clark kent. he hasn't been here in days. he hasn't even called.
half a million for you.  half a million for me.  one-point-three five for the colombians.
you’re not married, are you?
she said i have a son...
two questions. who the hell is seti the first? and was he rich?
i'm glad you're female.  do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
not at all.... i understand perfectly, count d'algout gave you a dog. you made it very clear, madame.
i beg your pardon?
do you?
it's the way they do things.
we're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  this guy fletcher's something else.
what'dya tell that soldier, soldier? you tell him we was rebels?
hold that lamp up -- i must see her face.
yeah!
put it in the cases. split it up. and don't forget you owe me £150.
larry, i'm gonna kill him.
what the...?
is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
they do not have your connections.
it's a miracle.
there's nothing wrong with ... that.
uh, no. there's one...down here.
shhh. wait for my instructions.
what the fuck did you do that for?
what's left of him.
...while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. the bureau's betrayed us...  the way they betrayed him...
nihilists!  jesus.
what's so illogical about that?
you're lying, aren't you?
my guess is dead.
where's the car?
did you.  what was that in aid of?
why you going to algeria?
what?!
yes, darling,
here.  you see.  this is the slow fuse.  it is much wider.  it has more resistance, more density. therefore, it burns slower.
what is it?
they don't have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you're the only one in town that can help me.
what do you love about it?
tony and i have to talk some business, first.
actually, some of the richest people i know have the worst manners.  of course, mr. harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  all right now, pay attention please.  salad fork.
the theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. she's also named palmer joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
you did what?  who did you talk to? what for?
dorothy parker--
that shouldn't be too hard to read.  iraq is the pink thing.
yeah i know. you're smart judge. you ain't no bourgeois nigger like those paper panthers across the bay. i need every good man to help us with the security on betty shabazz, particularly soldiers. you do solid on that i might have something else for you, something real important.
so you're a waitress, right? i mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
what baby? what baby? what baby are you speaking about?
machines?
the woman's surrounded by fools!  she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
sure, what else is new?
wyatt, listen, you can't beat him.  you're good and god knows you got the courage, but you ain't in ringo's class.  hell, he's the best that's ever been. 'cept maybe for wild bill.
but, then, i don't have a choice.
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
mozart, you are not the only composer in vienna.
whoee, it's cold. wisht i had somethin' to eat. bread, grits, beans even. soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then i'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
i don't mind waiting.
you said nothing. you told me nothing.
yeah, air.
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you.
you go to xavier high school, daryl?
why the empty cage?
we learn something new about ourselves every day.  now. maybe i didn't make myself clear. it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows.
there's rumor in the village. some call it magic.
yes.  it is, george.  yes.  it's a big decision.  and it's a big reward.  it's a big reward.  for one night's work.  but it's got to be tonight.
i know.
he's gotta be a nut!  he saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
almost five!
where's my daughter?
have you listened to his morning show, "wake up with ballplayer"?
where the fuck is red platoon! tell 'em to get their asses up here! what the fuck you doin' back here elias? round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
jury duty?  that's randomly selected by social security numbers.
i gotta go now, dad.
i guess we're going to find out.
well, here's the deal, max.  this thing i'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men.
now, look, john. here's the speech. it's in caps and double-spaced. you won't have any trouble reading it. not nervous, are you?
i've always wanted a watch like that.
we get it at work.  we get the magazine at work.
any one of them's ideal for home defense. which'll it be?
that's right.
no one yet, far as i can tell.  it has gone intestate.
that obvious, huh?
yeah?  me too...
map is kinda dirty, monster...
you need a haircut, commander.
just tell me who's closer to the wall?
how good it felt -
hey...you're here.  they told me you're here...and you're here.  how are you?
i'm doing everything i can! -- and stop calling me shirley!
what? i think i'm saying it. something's going on. he's either converted to christianity -- or to something else.
boats.  all anyone talks about is the wind.  is it up, is it down.  i can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
it's clear. they'll do everything possible to make it fail.
ted, what are you talking about?!
in case!!! the gun's in case!!!
i don't think we're ready.
no, wait -- apples.  apples.
that's my responsibility.
hat was this morning.
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
well, i can't talk though --
course maybe you don't have to wait until i faint.
look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
oh, jesus, johnny...
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
face it! confess it! you're weak!
no! he shouldn't be here! it should've been a trick!
you scared the shit out of me, man. you were dead for fifteen seconds. totally flatlined.
you know, rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
anything...a feeling...a smell..?
do you care about me?
yep. and while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? osso buco?...
i'm fed up with taking her orders. she swore she'd defeat the english before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  look at the mess we're in!  that's her mess, not mine...!  we're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as i say and sound the retreat!
if you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
well, i've not brought them.
take your pen in hand, marquis. purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
what is it, marquis?
then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
jack...
we got to make another copy of this. little life insurance.
shurrup!
look, why should it be yes or no? can't we keep it going and see? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. people do that, that's realistic.
stop that dog!
me?!
so the shit you gotta go through? to get from here to there?  brother said it was worth it.  worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
i don't know yet.
excuse me i have to make a call...
total manipulation. i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
but it's impossible.
i always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
merlin, help me. i need your help. i don't know how--
whatsamatter leonard?
seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
heaven and hell?
is she sleeping or...?
what is that thing?
screw you.
what about your twelve brothers?
people needn't worry so much. it's not my time yet. this isn't how i go.
yes.
i can't...
fuckin' a.
a word of advice my celibate friend. these czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. right kat?
well, of course, i'm sure you're a gentleman.
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! i never abandoned a source!
you're selling and ending the culture. not one bit of information. only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
so soon? without any of those answers you so longed for?
speak english will ya.
yes, sir.  i have him in my mind.
oh it's okay.  i've had better cag than this, but i've had worse too, if you know what i mean.
still a coincidence.  timing and all.
you mean man...
cobb's right. i mustn't talk to anybody.
hang...out?
it's bad isn't it?
i guess you forgot something.
how could you vouch for me? that's...  ... arrogant presumption -
tomorrow? what time tomorrow?
when a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
what did we know? we were seventeen.
fuck you care...?
the same. same as what?
did you speak to the governor?
but i do miss that green sport coat of yours.
are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
right here?
have many famous actors and actresses lived here? i was meaning to ask you that.
but if they did promote you
...the heck d'ya mean?
the cook again?
are you pierce patchett?
how am i supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
where is it?
do you love me?
you want her sheets?
...and she's looking to me for support. and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
i know. we just couldn't wait 'till monday to find out.
why? do you enjoy it?
i'm gonna go ask him.
your timing swallows the massive one. grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss don, and we can't do shit.  don't even ask about those discs. goddamn that art mooney with a star by his name!  it's tied to johnny's c.d., i know.
he's cutting our throat...
are you trying to make a fool of me? there are no europeans left in that hotel. get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, al.  i got soft.  you know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
hey, look.  you start paying, who knows what will happen.  you're a good father, george.  i always gave you that.  but you've got to talk to her.
i have to see somebody.
thanks.
you think that's a lot of money?
uh, oh...
gabe!
i have been given nothing. god makes men what they are.
yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
we got different information.
well he said...  you know in his way... you know what i mean? besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. so, dr. scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. he's laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. you know how he is.
come out, come out wherever you are...
you own this place?
the indian rope-trick.
yes!
a nice, big cock.
you first.
turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? i saw that one coming.
i've never been here before. i wonder whom you're thinking of. oh, i know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. today... now this might shock you... i went up to a taxi and said "eight rue du bois"... and here i am.
hot tip,  rubber biscuit in the third race at arlington.
a'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  okay, on three:  one... two...
...ants...
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
i'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
rose, you're very sick. you're burning up. rose, can you hear me? rose?
maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, tonto.
eleven o'clock! 
it's a lot of money, pam.
bring -- me -- the -- violin!
i don't want to get in trouble.
when we're airborne, with germany behind us, then i'll share that sentiment.
uh.  i saw that moving...
likewise. and draw two for chasers.  now you're beginning to live.
hello, sandman.
alright, now listen to me. i want you -- i want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
troy? is he your husband? or a boyfriend?
no not yet agnes, very soon but not yet. how did the baby get into you?
w-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
you don't have anything to do with it.
who are you spying on?
and i can never have children.
no, what's the matter with you? wake up! are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? are you so committed you cannot face the truth? bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. ask him why your name hasn't been in "muhammad speaks" in over a year? ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
i thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
it look nicer then home!
where do you want this stuff?
-- usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. why?  why do you want to know all this?
from their mothers and fathers of course. before that, i... i don't know.
is that something precious?

you know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and i was thinking back a year or two ago when ben called me and said he wanted to publish the pentagon papers the next day. the times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and i was frightened but i knew if i said no, i'd lose the whole fifth floor. so we published, and that night, after i'd told ben to go ahead, i woke up in the darkness and i thought, "oh my lord, what am i doing to this newspaper?"  i woke up again last night with that same question.  are we right on this story?
it is not.

i'm just leaving.
rex. go away. i don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
objection!
we're not saying anything about that night to the police. we should all forget that night.
so what are you bringing me?  looks like you got some film cans.
dorothy! ... dorothy!
sorry.  but after our days...  so if i try this thing... if i ship out to coronado... what happens here?
have a seat. i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing.
i didn't get a thing.  just the music lessons.  that's all there was to it.
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
she didn't mean it, doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, doc, i'm not thinking about myself --
and this?
oh, ha, ha, ha.
are you calling stan?
watch this.
well, that key's not gonna work. i had to pop the lock. you didn't leave me the trunk key.
okay, it's on. we've got some indicator lights here.
jesus christ, miles. get out!
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
it is a weighty problem, aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits, whoever he might be.
now we donít have to eliminate him?  you like that, donít you claire?  donít you?
i know who's trying to kill you.
jacques...?
yeah?
<u>you</u> said it.  but i won't argue -

...my pulse feels thready and i've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
now?
and you know what?
maybe i'm a quicker learner.
you know each other a long time?
mitchell's out of his mind now. martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
oh jesus, sheriff, i am sorry. i meant to call you -- i got distracted -- the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims. that's the good news.
i'd better go.  i gotta get up early. go over to my parents'.
you leave me high and dry...you come back looking like a zombie....
you'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
where are we going?
i know this sounds crazy.  i understand. check your parents' blood types.  are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
are they moulting now?
if i was smart i wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
why didn't you bring him?
no, no, get away, get away from me...
-- what could he have done to warrant that?
the twenty-five thousand dollar one.  the one with your name on it.  in bernard barker's florida account.  bernard barker, the watergate burglar--
halfdan the black.
vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
he said i couldn't win.  that no one wins at this game.

you what?
can you read it to me?
hey, kat.
you can't have them. go to hell.
haven't i seen you somewhere before?
i know you cold, brian. the scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. but you see, in this job there's no place to hide. isn't like selling log cabins. you have a bad day here -- someone dies. and that's not fucking good enough. want another beer?
you talking piffle, son?
there's nothing for me to do here anymore... i don't belong here i want to be with him now...
do it quickly, mr. dulaney.
this is where we're going?
a very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
you know what doris told me? she say: that duff's a nice guy. wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
did he try to?
you can also describe its cure. i'm eating its cure.
oh, yeah?
hi, barb!  i'm glad i caught you. i heard you were on vacation!
peter, i believe your baptism was perverted.  look at your certificate. your mother was the only witness to it. your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  peter...i'm sorry.
what does that mean?
then why won't she call...?
actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
you're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
you ain't no friend no more -- go home! outta my house i want ya!

when i was younger, i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.

excuse me. did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
hi
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
barnett?
what?
maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
i told you this was going to happen! i told you he was going to come after us! so we took the chance anyway and we lost. that's how it goes, okay? i got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
you don't look so good.
i'm awake?
it was wonderful.

thank you.
barnes got it in for you, don't he?
i gotta be careful.  if vinovich sees me talking to you.  he's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
i don't think i could be.
my daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  i'm going to move in with her.

the stewardess. do you know her last name?
bub-ut, baby, do you know that i love you too?

you're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
how much could you get?
hey--i want to ask you something.
nu!

she's in the kitchen. i'd yell for her, but i'd die.  you had a busy night last night.
well, it was my freshman year at princeton - there was this girl - her name was nellie - her father was vice-president of hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - i took off my glasses - i took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
where are we?
when do we start?
they won't do anything to junior, darling.  anonymous letter writers -   i've got guards in front of the house, and i'm going to arrange -
-- so much for the icebreakers. what're you after, ruth?
the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
...this month's checks.

jack.  jack.
why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
why am i calling you?  you're my father.  i'm not supposed to call you?  what's the matter with wanting to talk to you, daddy?

mbwun.
this epidemic could easily spread to our base, dr. floyd. we should be given all the facts.
perfect timing.
that's what i been thinkin' about. how you been keepin' me.  i ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
roma!  i'm talking to you...
as long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
detectives!

the ark of the covenant.
well...
goin' dove huntin'?
what's so great about sweden?
there was a coffin?
where are you going?!
it's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  he thinks someone's . . . i don't know, stalking us.
you missed somethin', ed.
... no, of course you don't. excuse me for being so presumptuous. no man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
same here.
you can see for yourself.
oh.
are you religious?
maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
what are you doing?
oh.
is he your boyfriend?
why should the sale not stick? hey, fuck you.  that's what i'm saying.  you have no idea of your job.  a man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  you hear what i'm saying to you?  your "end of month board..." you can't run an office. i don't care.  you don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  you ever been on a sit?  ever?  has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
and it's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. i guess i'm not the girl i thought i was.
do i knock or something?
hello?
what's the bastard really like?
mom... what are you wearing?
hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
that's the deal.
you can do it.
we're very close!  because of you!
why?  you ask me, lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  he's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
i want that shark alive.
you know, i believe she's actually jealous.
no, no seriously!  there's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
what's going on?
is that the kind of girl you think i am?  what can i do to make you relax?
great. now, what do you want to do about it?
appreciate it.
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, ted. they knew your mom and dad loved you very much. they knew they did the right thing. but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
he's going to kill himself.  go skate out on the bike path! it's that way!
eh, i don't know.
...truck!
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
well, are you gonna answer me? what'd you come here for?
you've been so great. i just feel a lot clearer about things.
kids.  ten seconds of joy. thirty years of misery.
gut feeling.
we're losing the pattern...!
i can't help girls coming up to me.
want a ride?
carl heine came.
real good, rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
what does the old timex say?
lord, i'm sorry i...
it's not my taste.
i think maybe over a hundred.
not necessarily. she'd probably want to help.
*                     please tell me your name.
we gotta slow down.  i'm so tired. let's just get out of here.
what do you think of this one?
there is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the gorge of eternal peril which no man has ever crossed.
it's cheaper than cigarettes. and it certainly beats this.
i'm sorry you can't see that, i know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that i'll always remember and i know the others do too --  they remember and they see how you have changed. that's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, jabez -- you're as blind as a burma bat, with your gold pot! mind you, it's not the money, i've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
what are my choices?
let's not start that again.
not for me.
let's watch some 'm.t.v.'
yeah, i should've stuck up for you, man, i know. you're my friend, she's your old lady.
i don't know. maybe i should grab my mace. i'm a civil attorney. i have little experience with "the criminal mind."
hey... !
i bet the view looks better from the worthin'tons'.
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind, you've lost your grip so say bye-bye
why did they leave?
they're not gonna let us in vada, we're kids.
well, i don't mean to.  here's your tea, tita.
i, i was asked to do this material - -
i ain't a idiot, asshole.
what shall we do?
sometimes i'm afraid of the lightning.
i don't know. yesterday.  sunday.
is there anything else?
if you say so.
she did?
you wouldn't believe me. i mean, people always say, "you wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
no, thank you.  i -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- i have this heavy date for tonight --
who told you that?
you came up here on a hunch, miss crane? nothing more? no phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
sidney fabrikant. our producer.
don't thank me, bill. i'm not doing you any favors.
don't know -- broussard got hurt somehow.
sit up, smile, zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
yes she is.
i've been looking at motorcycles.
mr. harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
he's got nothing to do with this. it's me you want, right?
well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. sweet sue and her society syncopators.
we don't know how much time we have. if i can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
stop it! i've had enough of your sermons! you act as if you created the world! 
it's all right with you, i'll just hang in the car.
all right boy: where's the money?
help meee!
no.  what's wrong with the front?
then quit.  you don't work for interpol, sam.
you gonna tell me what happened with you and exley?
wesley!
so you're on your way to tir asleen, huh?  i hate to tell you this, willow, but tir asleen dosn't exist.
easy, easy, easy, shhh!
did you know your mother better?
unbelievable, she got to you.
jesus christ.  why the hell didn't you tell me before?
yeah, i heard rumors.
--no one'll ever know.
where do you keep the can opener?
what about the sheriff's task force?
will.
how do you know that?
ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... everyday. now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  and you know what kris?
what's happening to me?
don't be witty.  yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. why did you stay on the bus, walter?
seven years work by the finest engraver.  mass produced, sequentially numbered.  the best there has ever been, mr. conklin.
who told you about my silver tongue?  you been talking to my wife?
i have ideas.
why no. she's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
i would think so.
granted, the free huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
terns... if i help you, clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. quid pro quo. i tell you things, you tell me things. not about this case, though - about yourself. yes or no?  yes or no, clarice. catherine is waiting. tick-tock, tick-tock...
i should have done that.  fixed it and more.  get out from under what i been under...
and if they succeed, humans won't make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow.  as first officer i should be the one beaming down...
but, doctor, i only wanted to speak to you --
you ever think about running away?
please let me go.
we did the same thing last year also.
sir, i'm a british officer.
casull .454 magnum.  you're talking twice the impact energy of .44 magnum hot loads.
what are you talking about?
bosen black.  flat.
you're a basket case.
we didn't do so bad after all.
'i like him'?  diane, i'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
i'm all ears, good buddy.
here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. day after tomorrow, i'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
no... tell me.
losing his teeth.
they don't believe her.
gee, i don't know. i guess i'm not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
ugh, what's that smell?
tommy leonard. the eyewitness in the corvis case.
okay, but just tell him this is one favor i can't give.  but he should try me again on anything else.
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  or should we just turn on the shower?
'yes' to the deal?
you say some of the children died?
good. i'm doctor taylor.
pirelli. coleman. agnew. shapiro.
guess what?  luther just got in line.
they said that'd be tomorrow.  they just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
yeah... i'm fucked up. you're fucked up. government's fucked up. whole country's fucked up. you got no idea what's going on here. this is bigger than you and me. we're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. the panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
no; who were the three, besides me?
all we've got to do is make it to the top.
what's so damn funny?
all day.
no.
i'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
but i want you and scott to understand.  do you think he loves janet? maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
you see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
she was a liar, she was a liar!
fine.
it looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
well i just don't think we have much to say to each other.
we need to talk, just you and i.
me.  may i eat with you tonight?
land of death. how do i get there?
victor frankenstein.
how'd you guess?
jean-louis -- thank heavens! do you have -- !  what's that?
i'll go check on brenda.
he's just as crooked as the next guy. you'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
permission to come aboard, sir.
no.  we're going to bring him down.
you know what, you are never satisfied.
no thanks.
what?
i didn't have a chance to wrap it.

what's that about?

do you think i...
mike brenn. yes. yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. at 29.83 at 9.  i'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
i really don't know.
what about his wife? the woman doctor? have you visited her yet?
okay. i'm on the bridge.

i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
i do?  sure i do.  can we speak off the record?  i'm a fair man.  i'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
i'm not...
do you know, eve - sometimes i think you keep things from me.
yeah, kid?
did you sleep well?
nobody's fuckin talking to you.
reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.

i don't know. i thought i did. now i'm not sure. i thought it had something to do with me.
lara called me.
i found it!
cos she loves <u>you</u>.  she wanted you to have a daddy to love.  even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
so, i'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
well, can you tell me why?
i don't have to take abuse from you.  i have other people dying to give it to me.
not at all.
enjoy your flight to washington --
i say freddie, what are you about?
fine. now, what does he do? he's got to sit down first and write it up. the where, when, why, how--and everything else. that takes time--
oh, i see, i thought you meant --
oh.
that requires me goin' out tonight?
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
i take it she read well.
and what do you do with the bones?
you do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
yeah.
not the way i did it. i was loaded half the time. i don't know how you could change bedpans sober. i used to hang out with this guy, glenn. he was an x-ray technician or something.
yeah.
so it's you he was after!
we failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  same with the kids.  they saw her running down the street, but that's it.  with no physical evidence, what do we have?  her word against his.
we made the date three months ago.
after the attack, a navy guy woke me up -- i don't know -- i thought he was an illusion.  but i checked the tape, and jerry said he manifested him.
just for the honeymoon.
now wait a minute! this business about spock  and mccoy... honestly, i have never understood vulcan mysticism -- i'm sorry! but part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... understand?
we'll take it!
yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
she's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  but nothing makeup won't cover.
with hypnocyl?
come on -- let's get busy. who gets your vote?
it's ... i don't know.  first world war, right?
i'll take him anyway.
these are their leads, their sources. i want you to have your reporters...
what was that?
...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.
i have seen it, but i don't remember this part.  funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  the movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
they gave you a pardon, man.  whatdaya want?
right now, before i back down.
like?
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
probe?  what probe?
get out...
oh my god.
they should be.  most valuable animal since sea biscuit.  <u>isn't</u> he...
bill, i'd like you to meet jack torrance.
i'm really sorry...
i was hoping for the real thing.
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i don't fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i gotta do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. i'm the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i gotta do? i'll do anything.
no, i saw a guy shooting from over there.  he was behind that fence. what are you going to do about it?
how intuitive! that must take years of training right there. maybe you can guess what has upset me.
no.
oh. i didn't know. i'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  you'll miss a great meal and i'll keep the scarf, anyway. what's your name?
can i see your hands?
come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
i hope you'll be gentle.
where do you live?
thanks.
get going where? i can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
you made a choice once.  do you think you would make that same choice again?
his name is jared nomak.
what if it doesn't come back?
uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
a gentleman would offer water.
sir, i'd like to request a furlough. two days?
okay.  i just thought as long as it was paid for --
no micheal did. it was an accident.
<i>                      listen now, you don't understand. that's not the point of christmasland.</i>
i thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
ask me them again. one by one.
that's mine.
i had a patient a few years ago. his name was ted casey...
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
have they got midge up there?
i've been trying to tell him, sheriff. he won't listen to me.
i know.
no way. no fuckin' way.
no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
lives are ephemeral. the knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
everything is temporary. that don't excuse nothing.
you know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, clarence?
perfect for a child.
and you, sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the rainbow bridge to asgaard?
what is that... wailing?
when we find him, he is mine.
it all seemed to make sense until box.
what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
latest casualty?  ernest harriman. you heard of him?
dr. st. luc? detective-sergeant heller. i'd like to ask you a few questions.
saavik... does dr. marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
i had no thought of offending you, oona.
live together.
no, no, you did fine.  i'd even say well done.  besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
we'll ask evelyn.  evelyn?  evelyn!
i've offered you some warm broth. i thought perhaps-
i got it... boss.
i would.
well, i'd like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding...
i do.
yeah?
i'm asking you a question --
again!
found this, but the battery's dead.
africa?  that's so far?  how do they get here?
i go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone -
why not?
kurtz.  i know you've heard of him.
i've also been thinking about the team. responsibilities, who should cover what --
i keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. if i could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, peter, if...
technology in the wilderness. only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
so that guy in the bar was right?  she's like... some kind of nun?
you saw her in the airport and then here?
are you supposed to be in iowa?
jason seemed to have the right stuff. physically, anyway. radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. he just kept going.
that's not true.  it was 1620.
where the hell have you been?
hey.
not now, beth.  please.  i want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  where's edmunds?
pagan symbols. fourth or fifth century.
hate those russkie choppers. rattle- trap pieces of garbage. i'm agent shavers. toby lee shavers. i'm looking for what's his name. three x' s.
i've some wonderful news for you, leon. it's about punchy... do you mind if i sit down?
gosh, you look nice.
before?!  eisenhower approved that?
yes i'm sure i hit the right commands.
yes, i find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  the rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
for sexual purposes?
pacifist!
i wish i were stronger.  do you think she's all right? do you think she's safe at the school?
let me get your change.
it's the truth, jake.
you hit me.
what are you trying to communicate? tell us.
you're nothing but a... a...
okay.
his yacht?
i'm ugly... i'm ugly! i'm ugly!
some people are very shy by nature.
lord, i forgot all about it -- sylvie works late tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. they wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
oh, delbruck, delbruck.  was will dien tachlas von dir?
i have no right to answer that.
you'll like it there.  i'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
maybe.  but maybe not.  we still don't have anything linking this to pg&e corporate. plus, there's the statute problem.  plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
just fine. what's the weather like?
so what's the point?
dickie, my god!
please hold the line... no such number is assigned.
what the hell are you laughing about?
rico then, at least call me rico in my own goddam place.
something wrong, man?  you look a little whiter than usual.
well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
get this man a kamikaze.
no, i'm fine.
i hope to go up next year.
how can they do this?
the dixie cups?  oh my.  i was just a girl.  of course.  spring is here the sun will shine
roy?  you still with us?
shit!
grace, listen to me.  in the trunk of my car is a rope.  it should reach down here.  got get it, throw it down and i'll climb up.
bob was a champion bodybuilder.  you know that chest expansion program you see on tv?  that was his idea.
you're death's <u>brother</u>?
...yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
and who is she? does she work in catania?
she's amazing.  she's ninety-three, she's a writer, and i told her about you.
so you won't help me?
i have to finish my job --
i told you not to go into that racket. you could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
don't!
you okay?  huh?  jimmy?
it's embarrassing, okay?
what do you want?
why did the chicken cross the road?
how's your pulse?
dude, let's help terrance and phillip!!
it was lucy!  lucy went to the cops!
oh, no. no, it's a... it's a traffic thing. no big deal.
open and shut?  <u>open and fucking shut</u>?
who told you...?
aw, come on, hooker, why don't you just...
what the hell are you doin' in there?
are you alright?
it's a hitchhiker.
that was him.
then i don't think so mr. bloom. if nothing is going to change, i'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
who the devil is he?
why would i want to?
yes, sir...  how can i help you?
and who, rose, may i ask, is that?
but i'm miss jessica's nurse, alma. you don't have to do that for me.
this is the most idiotic thing i've ever seen in my life!
shut up. shut your face.
when did john divorce?
uh... is this the right bus?
your wheel!  at fifteen em-pee-aitch i roll out!  i double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  the uzi!
wait a minute. sal. hold it. john wayne's making so much noise i can hardly --
you're not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
an american film about the mafia called 'see you next wednesday', and i want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
can you shut it down?
yeah.
yeah.
nothing.  but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
yeah, they do. and maybe when i start being a successful actor i'll know those guys. but most of the people i know are like me. they ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
would you remove your hat please?
tell the truth.
i love the pillows.
you ok?
i don't doubt it, mr. stanwyk. actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by alan stanwyk, who i believe is your son.
you don't know *no* girls around here. you're lyin', *you're runnin' away*!
liar!
i hate the press cases. especially the weird press cases.  where you going?
bore through.  ...they used to say living well was the best revenge, mr. bond.  they're wrong.  revenge is the best revenge.
we just saved a little baby boy. think of it that way.
they called and asked for it.  "dear sleepless in seattle. you are the most attractive man i've ever laid ears on."
how clear is manchester?
he's a rapist. like mine.
had any schooling?
sorry to bother you, sir. i have some rather distressing news about master dick.
what is it?
...anything else?
but lana, you could --
and, why is that?
lydia, i don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
did you ever own a saw?
<u>what</u>?
do we have characters?  how about honeycutt, snowflake, rastus, nigger, jim, sambo, jungle bunny, and how could we forget aunt jemima.
how're you doing?  looking lovely as always.
i'll have whatever she's having.
static is right! the radio's static, patton's static, we're static!
who said that?
sure, slingshot around the sun. if you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. if you don't, you fry..
...the guy the army guys are lookin' for!
intestines.
i don't know.
it's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
jeremiah, what are you doing?
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.
what does burbage care of that? he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe.
oh. why didn't you just say so?
oh, probably just a picture request. i'll take care of it if you want, lois.
guy or girl?
is that what a good doctor would do? how old are you, please?
we know why john was tagged.
why is he in the basement?
epps, is that a sand dune.
are you hurt?
and what has that to do with it?
i dreamed that i... that i killed you and danny.
maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. say some words over him.
i didn't ask you about the list, i asked you your name.
nay.  that's but to distract the casual visitor.  a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
you're not here.
shit, i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
what's the diagnosis, doctor? a touch of the sun?
right.
in case you've never heard of how i lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
how you guys doing?
i'm half irish.
. . . i look at you, lenny, and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
you're being ridiculous.
how about it, ma?
emma in wonderland. welcome, mrs. peel.  we've been expecting you. we hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. decontamination is almost complete.
so, it's back to the islands.
thank you.
forget sal... listen to me -- forget sal! i've been working on sal since dawn, nick. sal's in a dream and he won't come out. listen!!! from here on you gotta go for you. you hear me? for you!
mozart! herr mozart, may i have a word with you please. right away.
who?
you're happy for me and victor.
then he has.
technically.  they're separated.
i'll bet.
maybe you'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, nigel?
how many bullets left, kid?
okay.  you ready?
well, because you guys don't look alike.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry if it gets noisy --
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon. i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
yes.
can't we hold him?
i think santos or marietta fortune.
...what's your name?
look at yourself, joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. for a stud in this town that's a handicap.
oh, they're all right, anne. but i—
are you okay, jack?
no, thanks sheriff. i'm leaving town tonight.
i know you're busy so i'll get right to it.  did you know her?
lemme guess. some corporate v.p.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
so don't marry him.
who?
that's your problem.
we sure do.  i don't mean it as a knock either.  go ahead.  i'll just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want.
i am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. how long have you been with the company now ?
because it ain't natural, young man.
what?
i'll give you a tip. here's forty dollars.
i wonder where they're going.
hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? we're not a bunch of icy streets here.
i sleep it off.
if it's you, what are you doing here?
chloe's dead.
please, dad, just do it.
being here, with me.
oh--he come to an accommodation. money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
keyser soze
yeah. i guess--sometimes--senator paine must be right. sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  and if you say so too, saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
cobb! get lunch for the rest of them.
jesus christ!
sera... what you don't understand is...
hey, schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those russian broads?
don't say it.  we're both ragged out right now.
you watch.  one day, i'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  i'll have more money than god.
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
atrocious torture.  hit of the season, you want, i know a guy can get you a ticket.
you really don't remember?
drink this.
how did this... how did i let this happen?
what the hell's going on?
that is so sad --
no one knows. they say it blew up.
this is good.  this is real good. this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  they'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
are you elijah's pimp?
yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
mr. martins. delighted to meet you. come let's sit down here. ober! zwei. what would you like. tea? coffee?
why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
yes, maude, it is.  it is a <u>very</u> good play.
we can't just sit here.  we've got to start moving, so pick.
he was fully sedated!
what do you mean?
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands?  is it not so?
yeah, most people just whiz on by like i was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
this is nice. i mean it.
he needs professional help.  i think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  odorless. undetectable by dogs.  undetectable by anyone.
you do more than try.
tender-headed runs in my family. you tender-headed?
dammit, i'm so sick of this.
four or five days ago. why?
lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. could i see your license, please?
thank you.
thanks for a swell time.
what are you trying to say? just because i dress well and like to dance --
ah, adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  she's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
bastard...
my employer wishes to remain anonymous.
you know, with the makeup and everything1 i actually thought he was smart for a second.
i've been thinking, ben, about wendy. i was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet dr. woolens.
your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
good morning.
bobby, don't say anything.
we're covered on legal with that, right?
i tried to reach ruth, but we couldn't get her.
oh, come on, pony. i'm just kidding. wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? you know, there's a life on the road?
i know the answer.  i know all there is to know about louis.
he doesn't answer.
maybe you better sit back down. you don't look so good.
yes it is.  can we please not do that? please?  cause it is.
is there a difference?
what's he doing?
you're right. only you can do that.
i'm not going alone. i'll take gregoire with me. he's a good hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
you think freeze will take the bait?
aha!  he has a brilliant military record, i'm sure.
i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes. just the facts, general.
ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
why shouldn't i be in a place like this? i'm a whore!
length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
but she isn't due for an hour, sir.
so who's the guy?
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom?
ed, all i'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
what?
what are we delivering?
wladek, stop that. it's over now. just be proud it happened. my god, did they put up a fight.
stevie, how's it going my man?  somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
but here at the hotel dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
i'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
what if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. you just don't do it for her.
shit man. it was... you know spontaneous.
...i've got this lacrosse game.  it's really important, it's our last game. and you know, central almost beat us last time, so i really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at state, which means that after the game i might be able to stop by...
what are you talking about, erik?
sure.  the kremlin.  makes sense. the kremlin.  why not?  listen, this is all too indiana jones and the lost city of king tut for me, man.  throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw alex...
are you listening to me, lennon?
...go through with this? what are you going to do?
if you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
sorry.
but where did you get it, amy?
i doubt friedman ever even met leon, deborah. friedman dealt with select customers. as for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles.
my god.
no i don't.  i don't take orders from smurfs.
not now, mammoth. adonis is right. we've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. we chould be resting up.
really?  married kevin?  her junior high sweetheart... what chance would i have had against that?  none, no chance.  that's just fate.
yes...
rain.
he's a barber.
no. i don't want it to.
well, jeffries, why come to us about it?  why don't you go up to the houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
where is everybody?
sarah, order a chopper. i want the next thing smoking and i don't care whose. ours. dcpd.  or the marines. then call documents. tell them to scramble a team. i want everybody moving in five minutes.  dr. chilton, please do not handle the note. i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... i must sit close to him.
what goes down there? i mean who's the priest i keep seeing, he's there all the time. he has black hair and he's very intense looking?
i needed this, y'know? i really needed this. just when i'm nearing the fruition of my project, big bird flies into town.  go ahead! kill me by inches! put me on the agony rack!
humans make illogical decisions...
what?
oh, son of a bitch!  aaghgh!! i mean, son of a biscuit!
just till i lose.
could be.
what's that?
bollocks.  this happens every time i go to the cinema.  average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere i look, glasses.  but the moment i need them they disappear.  it's one of life's real cruelties.
vicky, wait.
okay, baby. now you outfitted. you ready to tackle the street?
well, betsy mam, i drive a taxi at night.
no, we had a clear soup to start. this is a thick one and you ought to taste it. there's nothing like it back home.
you had to remind me?
oh yeah? anything you say.
god, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
no, it's good to see you.
b-but... we saw... your neck...
come on. he's a crook.
you are being rude again.
... many men have tried.
fine. just lend me your car.
because... because -- i mean -- the english have a broad sense of humor, but... i mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  what makes you think they'll listen to you?
he called me chicken.
kirin?
i wrote an address in there, too. might be useful. it's this abandoned place outside of town. i guy i know used to use it for his bigger deals.
khan!
how'd you have the manpower to--
he still hasn't shown up. why aren't you in class?
art thou not romeo and a montague?
well, what the hell good can we do in here?  we can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
he's going after debbie.  i gotta stop him.
wrong day?
counselor. what can i do for you?
the tough part's almost over for you. i mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
don't you guys ever knock?
say something, mark, say something --
i don't get it.
such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
i think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  i'm right.  only two hundred dollars.
how's that, sheriff?
come on, frances. louella parsons is here. she wants to talk to you, help you out.
all ready?
right.
i suppose so. he sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
baxter.
what's this mama shit?
they gonna drive me anyways. soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. until then...
a little longer, paul?
you want me to burn my book?
of course, don’t be silly.
all my things have me in them. i don't want you to be like me.
any idea what he looks like?
j.j., if you think -
a fast.  to remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
my back. i can't move. i need my chiropractor.
you know, now that i hear myself tell it, i'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. what, you get the helmet monday through thursday, then brock takes it for the weekend...
i said nobody dies.  nobody dies.
i said, <u>i'll take you there</u>. nobody's going near star without me.
madonna.
it's been quite a night. i understand that your understudy - miss harrington - has given her notice.
oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
you ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
i want to know where my daughter is. her name is kristen, or joanne. she's with you.
it'll never work.
yes. i'll meet you at grand central at noon. okay. do me. i command you.
i'm sayin' we har this man away.
he knows his alphabet.
in a week you should be fine.
this one has eyes.  why did they leave your eyes? could you ever....
please... i wasn't there... ask pimm.
hello?
not quite...quarter cherokee. the rest is welsh...so they tell me.
good one!  thanks.
jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
why won't you tell me your name?
i don't remember. "cinderella man!" what do they mean by that?
go ahead to the saloon. but don't get too drunk!
lots of places.  the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.
i'm not. she just left.

he's been here all night?
it isn't true.  you have to believe me.

five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  the leg got infected. last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor.  the doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  the krauts must have shown up while he was gone.

at that point were you able to fight him off?
sleep all right?
gear shift.
if you get injured, you get nothing.
i know.  i know how rough life can be. and how unfair.  so here's what we do. tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
aiiee.  more waiting?  i don't know if i like this plan.
i know the story.  a federal judge.  he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
i had a father who knew how to steal.

please!
this doesn't taste like cappuccino.
a sea-gull? what's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? that's a bad omen, isn't it? 
you know, that's real sweet music in there. you can almost smell the action and the money. you know, i can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
what happened?
is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
danny, tell me what you're thinking.
sorry, buddy!
you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  don't be afraid to tell them.  clemenza and i know each other well, he understands these things.  let yourself be guided by him.  he has more experience in these matters.

so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting?
come and get him.
i'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
...maybe i better forget it.
why tell me?
right. i promised my mother.
you can't change your mind.
this the book your writing?
about oscar...i think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. he can't make the payments...i don't know what to make of it.  he says groppi's run off with a girl. i could help if you want.
i think i know where a cb is.
you want to put him on your couch, norman.  grill him about his childhood?
why not?
i ain't like that no more, kid. whiskey done it as much as anythin' i guess.  i ain't touched a drop in ten years. my wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
aw, what is this...
how come you're not older?
of course, of course. leave it to me. how do i authorize a cheque?
oh sure. they say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
it can turn itself on, alex!  it doesn't need a quarter.
you two could play checkers.
you know of it?
well, it's the funny man. give it here, package boy.
try holding the match like this.
next we got a siberian redneck, viktor. into snowmobiles and snowboarding. so naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
this clear moon's house?
so there were others?
do you have a motel or something? money?
mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. the transporter beam is non-operational. captain, we've received important orders from starlet command.
if it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
wait ... wait.  you ... you have to help me.  i don't understand.  am i dreaming this?
let me worry about that, major. i've still got my red line to the air command.
i have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
who's running the show, armitage? this a government sting?
thanks, i feel much better. listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to utah with alan?
you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the ilium range, a couple days ago?
the car accident? any of this ringing a bell?
i'm tellin' ya, i'm giving you all i know.
i can't fucking believe this guy. an apology, bob?
you didn't...
do you still keep your key under the mat?
yeah?
girlfriend?
the people at this school are so incredibly foul.
why, because i'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
were the lights on?
no, chippewa falls.
i did.  boy.
maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
he didn't mention the money.  what he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! that's what i want you to do something about!
look, tran... lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  an old friend of mine has been murdered. you remember iris?
do you know what he's been saying to her?
me?
you still like me, don't you?  we're still buddies?
i don't know. i say what i mean.
more light, chief?
hello.
hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  he can't make it.
i'll be home in a little while, harry.  don't wait up.
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  what strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
and how many lives have you destroyed?
how'd you find me?
no, the other hotel paraiso, in the city.  near the plaza del sol.
...okay. i'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  marty's a good man, brian.
but, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
..it seems we have a problem, dmitri.
i'm sorry...i....
how is it a farce?
you. you're the guy that lent me the money.
because...he wanted to them to be punished.
he's not giving up?
objection, your honor!  counsel is harassing the witness.
i'm sorry, mrs. rieper. i'm feeling quite fatigued.
no sense at all.  i'm a little stressed.
the fifth element...
you know what gets me?  those guys who went to the moon!  to the moon, boy!
frank, please...
no.
case... yeah, miami joeboy, quick study. how you doing, kid?
but maxine, i thought it was me you loved.
harvard? whoa, daddy!
some what?
not next week's either...listen...you tell that to giovanni, not me.
when they realise i’m missing...
umm. well. yes. but no more strange voices in the night, rose.
you're sure?
don't worry about him...what have you got?
i wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
i'm afraid this is a wine bar, mr. quince.
how the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  you take my point?
do you care about criminal matters peripheral to susan's murder?
so, you gotta boyfriend?
you're going to your ship, i'm going to mine. science vessel. i've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
he had a few birds.  i got up and fed 'em this morning.
i'm having lunch with him today. he expects an answer. it's going to be pretty.
what's wrong with that?
i can live with those reflections.
those are pretty hostile words.
i hear you talkin' clarence. we park our cars in the same garage.
the customers?  i don't know...
her portrait?
we were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
television or movies?
listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
oh, shut up.
yes, really.  i don't want you to be unhappy, jack.  if you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
they could put you back in the tube..
let them go --
but how are you finding new orleans, senor farragut?
i ain't full.
what generation are you?
don't be stubborn. the pay won't be grand, but it's regular. that's what you need, isn't it? i know you don't like taking my advice...
i need you to stake me. i can't do it without it. it's just a couple hundred grand. taken out of our cut when we're done.
i can do benefits
so what's the prognosis, fertile myrtle? minus or plus?
yeah. ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
captain mertin?
what are you talking about?
that's right. you put cliff on television. so then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
you're not giving up, are you, mr. dickson?
hi.  where's holly?
hey. stinky. kitchen's closed.  whatcha havin'? six library guards, raw? plus belts and boots? man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
i forgot to show you this. the gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
where're you going?
so what do we do ?
yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
don't worry, honey
and now that superman's out of the nice guy business...
maybe. but i'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
there is no reason to assume other people were involved.
yes.  and i say yes because who is to judge?  who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  who?  who can play god?
wait just a minute.  what are you trying to pull?!
what did they give you?
ass right.
is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
you investigating those murders out at the lake?
i was afraid, okay? somehow, i was sure it was keyser soze at that point. i couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
your majesty.
a willie o'keefe?
you want to throw it all away, is that it? you had everything, little sister. beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. you were a movie star!
happy little housewife...
bravo, mr. fletcher.
yes.  it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. do you know what that means?
she's not alive, but she didn't die.
come on!
i missed you, lieutenant.
jack.
sure it does. it's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
with river oaks?
sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
you see, karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. he couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. but, his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said. and she made sure karl knew. you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
as a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer george viznick, we welcome peter kelson, author of the current best-seller, vicious intent. thank you for joining us, peter.
just say yes! nothing else, just say yes.
when?
what is your husband's profession?
look, i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake.  i didn't want to hurt you. you've been good to me.  you're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
you're bettin' on an inside straight this time. you'll never pull it off.
thanks, billy.
i'm going through a period of my life where i just can't be around people.  i didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
come on, heathcliff, i'll walk you to the corner.
...how's the turtle food this week?
and i have a special feeling too, because i do. it's special.
there's something else i want from you.
all right, i will. here's looking at you, kid.
in america they'd bring only a penny. i guess that's about all they're worth.
i don't do favors for you anymore.
how does he know who i am?
yeah.
shit!  he sent them all.
they knew who you were when they broke in your house?
you don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. no, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and i know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
i ordered you to defend this ship.
so i've been told.  practically an obsession of your.
money problems?
not so well, i regret to say.  this business with the maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  that's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
did you test the auto-pilots? the satellite positioning receiver?
i have a family.
i'm sure it's a great town, dr. chilton, but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon.
why?
getting started! christ jesus! started?!  you mean you don't have anything?!
you know you just do this for shock value. it's not shocking.
carcharadon carcharias.
i couldn't mail it; i didn't know your address. but i had a landmark. i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you.
and no one will know the truth.
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
i, uh... haven't been to sunday school in years...
aww, the little bird died.
then what?
getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
you went to my high-school?
if you don't, we will.  it has to be total, deckard.  that's an order from as high as it comes.  got it?
that's how he died you know.
hi, plato!
yes, that's what i mean.
they tell you that?
whew!  i'm glad that's over with.
yes, i was lying.
thats not a story, alex. it's a corpse.
of course not.  does he look lost to you?  bennnnn!!!
say it and you'll believe it. life is good. say it.
i'm getting out now.
i'll write it myself.
you better get going, hon.
but corrado...  if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
the power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. it's not fair! i've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! but no! thirty three years of dedication and research, and all i've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
i'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
actually, i am, though.
i may have, as... as i said, i simply don't remember.
these guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
are you comfortable?  do you... want to move to the bedroom?
and you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
i can't believe you're taking his side.
two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
yeah, they told me.
...no...no goddamn use.  i have a son, y'know?
you know...sometimes people can surprise you.  sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
who is it?
i'm acting on orders form the federation council.
behind that bush there.
apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  i read the clocks. they bear out hasslein's hypothesis. we've been away from earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  still can't accept it, huh?
...it was a toss-up. his company went to india, mine went to france. flip of a coin.
what's wrong, did you miss me?
the bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. but chickens don't give milk.
i can't do that.
your dissertation? what subject do you study?
and you have no idea where he lives?
can you help mom?
it seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
where to?
i know.  uh...alice.
how about breakfast, i was just going to make some.
my card.
shut up.  let me see your grenades.
but i do believe it -- that's what i don't believe. so it's goodbye alexander dyle -- welcome home peter joshua.
so do i, jane.  i'm on vacation.
yes, mister mcmurphy?
wuddya do?  carl looks around.
don't toy with me, doctor.
joey?
don't tell anybody.
were you with him, when...
tell george and jessica to try and cover everything without tom having to ask additional questions.
let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  we'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
yes i can, marcie.  and until you start givin' me some straight answers: i'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
what does it matter.
then it went well.
you see, it works like this. you get your ass in trouble, i get your ass out. that's my job. and i don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
but the thumb always works. different ways to do it, though. depends on how you feel. for instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  that shows independence. you don't care if they stop or not. 'cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
anybody know about this?
where'd johnny find you?
yes. peter warne.
what are you going to do?
man that's a trippy name, kinda like the warhol mayhem series...
agent novak.
one of the two men was hubley, right?  what about the other one? did you know him?
no...
what's wrong?
we went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
"stop! just stop! that's what you said from the beginning. if i tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
emory had made a lot of enemies. he had a big mouth.
is this the guy you saw them with?
mike! you have a mess on c-9!
how is this national security?
yes.  it was.  thanks for the compass. i'll look after it for you.
give me your phone.
roselli?  johnny roselli?
i'd believe him.
yes.
it's a calder.
because i got some plans -
thank you, john.
how can they do this?
you're too human, blade.
i already apologized.
oh hi.  it's william thacker.  we, ahm i work in a bookshop.
what do you mean?... you've been acting strange lately... like the other night.
oh man...what happened?
charlie really has a great voice.
what's going on? when do we get paid off...?
not terrific enough. what were you doing in that part of town? who were you with?
now tell me, why would i want to do that?
hey, mister.  you gotta quarter?
well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that lula back here and away from that murderer.
right.  thanks a lot.  and congratulations.  it's not easy finding love these days.
uhhhh...
you're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  you like the man, you like the way he plays.  how about a little jazz, huh?
i... i got back a stack today. some nice shots.  see, a good topless june wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to stucky, love june.
could there have been anyone else?
when i was a girl my father took me to the edge of el capitan. three thousand feet of granite. straight down. i was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. i couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
really?
who wants fruit salad?
they saw you kill the driver.
what's that--detour?
why are we landing?
release the evil?
when!?
he's batty!
i might be able to accommodate you. is there some more luggage?
no i don't.
you are.
thomas kent!
ain't that something?!  that's just fine, baby.
a woman?
daddy!
don't tell me: you're from outer space.
oh, right. oh, oh my god! pony, it's so huge!
oh come on, cecil.
but -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
is that supposed to frighten me?
were you going to make a suggestion?
leonard does not hold a driving licence. as for his passport, i do not know where he keeps it.
an iraqi?
i thought you liked them.  they liked you.
what do you want from me?
coffin?
what? what did we do?
yeah, he's told me. burnfield. we all hear about burnfield.
how much time do i have?
kelly...
you think skipper and alice do it?
where are they gone? you know where they are?
is there dancing?
well, i called erica's beeper. there's just no answer.
tell me something, jack, how much longer you in here?
i didn't speak to him, sir.  but colonel "bat" guano was in command of the special service battalion, so i would imagine he did.
wow.  thank you.
my wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. as you may have noticed.
i'm supposed to be mad at you, but i'm not.
mother, you know, i can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
no!
what about after?
that door is a safely hazard.
the hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way.  you hear me, private?
i decide what's right in this jurisdiction. now move.
i...i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to make a joke of it.
i beg you, donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
oh, dicky, i c-c-can't...
something funny, levi?
so what's the problem?
i won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if i don’t tell you to sit down. now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, mr lombard. 
cut it out.
so did we.  i sent him to franklin and erie.
captain willard?
figured they'd send someone after you. thought i'd wait around and see who showed up.
what would my being a faggot have to do with that?
if you think you can finish it, i'll be back later today.
i don't care about that girl, i don't care if she's dead.
who's the other woman?
agnes. what did your mother do to you?  if you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. did... did she hit you?  did she make you do something you didn't want to?  did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  did it embarrass you?  did it... did it hurt you?  what did she make you you do?
well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. i can't go to sleep. i have to be at work in three hours. you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
mom -- this is the best show all year.
are you afraid to die, mr. henry?
we know you didn't kill those guards.
all i need is the front money and a truck. i could be back in two, three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving.
i’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
i don't want to go to europe.
and now he has returned the compliment. herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you.
hope not.
i don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
she could be telling the truth.
you know, i like tom, because hi...
do it.
yes.
and these were drawn from life?
reilly, vice. i-
i'll take what's mine now.
no, you're not.  so stop comparing yourself to him.  you have no reason to ... you have everything you ever wanted. you've earned it.  why can't you just enjoy it?
we've got only half an hour till the final run-through. he can't walk out on us.
you must not look to me for help. your brother is no longer my problem. he is now your problem, conway.
that's all over as far as i'm concerned, emmett. i'm satisfied.
we're outa here. lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. this real estate's about to go buggy.
ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
i dream i'm asleep.  i dream that i'm asleep and i can't wake up.  i don't think i smoke.
yes.
you are fair as the first new flower of spring...
hello?
mom?  you're alive...
that's usually my line.
what do you smell?
the boys at school don't think i am.
why don't you call the cops?
oh, sally mae...
started in kansas city. couple of housewives.
to you!  you just made a 'yummy' sound, so i thought you liked the dessert.
look, miss thompson, i don't know what you want from me.
molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
i don't know.
so where the hell's god now, huh?  i'll tell you where! he's up there pissing on me!
why are you here?
i imagine it would, yes.  so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties.
you sure?  you look pretty shaky...
no, no, whoa!
you're going to new york with us.
well, i dunno.  i mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
you were his friend... you must have been, if he had given you this...  if he sent you to his home. he was the best this country had -- he was --
otto, i don't like thorkel any more than you do.  but he has got a point.
i know you... do i not?
not exactly, miss. not exactly.
what?
well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
yeah, why?
ro, how long have we known each other.
he's good...  and i'm an expert on doctors.
...embarrassing, shameful...
you're also a fool.
hold at forty.  slow circle of the complex.
mr. dobisch said that?
-- that i was a marine.  which is true.  you filled in the rest.
no, i know what you're going to say. i don't know anything about making a video. but that's a plus.
thank you very much, clarence.
now, snap out of it, fella!
yes, go on.
it's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the enterprise just isn't responding.
660 marshall street.  tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
you were at the emerald that night?
aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
you want me to die? i thought you and i were tight.
this is crazy. you can't escape like this.
she will not be murdered. on the day of the wedding, i want the thieves' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
tim, tim, tim....
oh shit...
aye, sir; thrusters...
french.
hi.
... too young for whisky...
who?  that tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
you know what happened.
no.
me too.
what tape?
say that again.
oh jesus...
charlie,. i've been trying to postpone this. but what's the point? it's over.  i don't want to hurt you. this is very hard for me. i'm doing this for both of us. i really want you to be happy.
well... are you self-conscious about it?
hi enid.
dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. no false notes. always honest.
i do. i remember from day one. people staring at me, sensing i was different. watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts i wasn't human.
your uncle will like this.
yo getting there taylor. you be cool now and i'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
yes -- oh my, god.  is that you, simone?!  i've been wanting to talk to you.
i want more action. i want to see more ingenuity than that. i want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
this guy must have had a .44 like yours, jack. now he's got yours.
well, mr. kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
whew! that wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
the cards are now my only livelihood.  sometimes i am in luck, and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  it's property, look you, and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me. when the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste.  do you understand the cards?
i guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. he's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. i'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? it's just boring. i don't know, he was just different. and he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and i like that, i felt comfortable around him.  after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
what about me? i don't have a car.
not that kind of history. the small stuff! about people you never heard of!
any old where ... but not our little richard ... oh no! when you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
is that so? you might marry me?
keep it, sire, if you want to. it is already here in my head.
lotte called me.
consider yourself lucky. in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
a fair number, ma.
primitive?
i would've come sooner, but...i didn't... how're you doin'?
for my life? at a discussion group? i think not.
*ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
you know what this is?  it's a dinosaur egg.  the dinosaurs are breeding.
...that was vicki, her best friend. dat dress will cast ya round...
kid--kid--
i want you to leave her alone.  i don't want you involving her in....
what? no, i'm was worried that... i was just wondering what's taking so long.
one set of muddy shoe prints.
hey, i'm, you know --
i missed you.
please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
hey!  give me that baby!
sorry...
no....
don't you think there's too much gold?
no. i will not betray my friends.
that isn't true.  you never understood her.
tiger's challenged you and jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
do you got something for me?
...okay, max, i believe you...i'll get out of the building...
what are you doing here? i told you to stay hidden! it's not safe for you up here.
i'm still here.
you scared me.
thirty-five thousand, sir. coins and currency. and the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
uh huh, great.  then those fat fucks in washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
just cut his hair, you know.
i'm sure glad i'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
theory, partner...if it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...confuse it...drive it away....
you did break in.
you think that section on the point is ridable, lance?
i feel giddy.
yes?   go right ahead.
actually, i...i don't. what does that mean?
this isn't music!
i've missed you.
i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
i knew that feuds still went on, but i didn't think people like you and the general would be involved.
it's not optional!
i'm not ready.
for what?
i don't like that word much, carter.
you forget, i dislike you at least as much as him.
how do you know him?
maybe i'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. and a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
we'll walk.  and if we have to, we'll starve.
abbe de coulmier!
weren't you on a television series?
since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all, can be a very expensive proposition ethan.  so, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
wait a minute! i need you.
just before she died she came to--
when i was young i thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
they're all over everybody.
what did you tell her about the shop for?
good! good!  stay there. don't show your face down here. i'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. they'll never know where the stories are coming from. stick close to him, babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. we'll have the other papers crazy.  babe, i could kiss you!
vice... jesus.
it will?  how do you figure?
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop. i was a careful child and i became a careful adult, but at least i wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
what if your parents come home?
cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  nobody wants to go.
jesus, give him a break. there isn't enough proof yet to go public. sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. not 'till it's locked.
well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and i'll focus on the molecular physics.  or, uhm, maybe i should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
you heard what johnny said. no part of the waterfront'll be safe for you now. maybe inland— the middle west somewhere— a job on a farm... .
come on. the guy is a pipe dream. this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
i'm sure.
she's on tv.
this kid just wants his freedom.
who the fuck are you?
this'll be nice. we haven't seen any of the sights yet. it's history. when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this.
where did you disappear to?
we shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
put it here.
emma, which is it--horace miller or henry hill?
i am... grateful for what you have given me. but i still do not wish to be assimilated.
we'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. they have this empty house near this creek. it's actually pretty... ok... i love you.  dad wants to talk to you.
have you been heating the house? not just with the stove.
the little skate-fuckers.
okay, we gotta get over there.  can you borrow a dress from cecile or something--
yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
but maybe not.
i’m sorry i was such a bitch. i really appreciate your doing this.
mary clarence!
never! i'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way.
no. life is too short.
get out of here, jack!
mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
no one brought them here! no one wanted them here!
the story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
aye.  before the wee pesties attacked.
holy shit cartman!  what was that?!
what's the gimmick, yorgi? that's the part i don't get. you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? i didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
er, very nice harry. what's it for?
mrs. redi, there's one thing —-with jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? what do you do with the receipts? how do you sign checks--?
we been through this before--
you are on your own?
you want to hear this idea? it's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. go on, tell her.
yes!  it's all written down in the notes.  tie off the kites and come down!
it beats dr. simm's theory.  she thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
give me another.
you gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  think you can handle it?
...we goin'?
twenty-eight.
and we're here on the couch...
it was wild.  she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  i tried to satisfy her the best i could, but it was difficult in my condition.
down at the dock by the tides restaurant. ever handled an outboard boat?
you know ... i like you people ... i really do.
maybe so.
that's what everybody says.
what do you mean?
are you alright"?
that night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  david's blood.  i'm one of them, star!  i'm just like them!
so, you see how silly that rumor is?
when your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
it takes hours to get a drink around here.  there's only one waitress.
curse?
what do you mean by necessary? she's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend johnnie farragut.
believe me, adolf hitler couldn't possibly have hated the jews as much as i do. not in a billion years. you know why?
she never even looked at you.
send in the next girl. 
fuck you, panes.
what's debbie's blue book value right now?
cars don't explode that way. any simpleton knows that.
you could've handwritten it.
i can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
give me my book.
i said i was sorry.
what was this for?
well, it doesn't make sense, nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
i won't tell you over the phone. i'm comin' to n.o. and i'll tell you then.
can anyone else see him?
make yourself at home. don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. i won't be long.
he's my father.
toothache.
you know, i voted for you in your last election.
so, like, where is she?
just us.
ronnie... yeah, so.
spying?!
easy there.
is there anything to understand?
have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
we're not talking about any ordinary prisoner hoffman! we are talking about evil on two legs.
hi.  i'm todd aubochon.
that's what the guy said.
why?
come and get me, soldier --
and you saw a shape ahead of you...
sam ... you haven't had dessert.
i...
yes, papa, name it. name it. i'll do anything you say!
c'est tres amusant... you have been promoted. and to a jew... i am joking of course. naturellement. seriously, nick, may i hope that you have come to play?
she called you 'george,' george.
now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
'cause it stinks.
you can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
twelve years.
i did live there in the state hospital.
it's hard to find.  it's an old civil war cemetery.  nobody ever goes there.  so... what is it you say you do?
you're really cramping my style here.
i ain't your partner, i'm your manager. i'm managing to get your money out of mexico, into america, in your hands, and i'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. that makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
i'm not goin' in there, i don't like the looks of it!
i wouldn't be caught dead.  no, it's probably how i would be caught.  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait --
hi, i'm kit. i'm not keeping you from anything important, am i?
do you not like him like daddy?
the future is ours so let's plan it.
what are you going to do? now that you've quit the police force?
someone not his wife?
yes.
not quite. i just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. isn't that a little strange?
what do you mean you don't know?
because you're still working for cohaagen.
let's go!
acetylene? mig? tig?
that morning.  he was talking to me and leon about marriage.
i'm not trying to tell you he's little lord fauntleroy.
i don't want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
what do you mean—starvation?
there's this guy. i heard him talking in my apartment. he's one of the eraser guys. and he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. this ain't solvin' my problem. i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. i'm off today, but if i can't leave the country i'm out of a job. and if i don't got a job, i can't hire a lawyer.
sure i'll speak to your class. but i'm a hard man on women. you want to know why?
what?
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months. they're been gone seven years.
exactly what?
waiter! she needs more water.
with your dry wit and humor--
...and awduhs a light lunch.
what about jackie?
hello, hildy! what are you doing around here?
not now, mom, i'm busy!
yes, you can.
hey, george.  you okay?
anything?
what's fair?
what's the matter?
for frontera? hell, i can't remember dates no more. i do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. he almost took some poor fella's head off at the legion in arroyo grande, and figured it was time to move on.
there was no sperm.
frank...
you like spaghetti?
will you stand still so i can do this!
no. they asked who i was, then told me what corner.
watchers?
no.
right, and how long have you had these pains, mr. barber?
so.
phoebe?
sorry to interrupt the festivities, dave, but i think we've got a problem.
hey!!
it's beautiful.
where's michael?
akina delutan, nou-shan.
i can handle it.
do you swear?
be my guest, agent kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
i'll watch my back.
thank you very much, sir.
what's in the bag?  garbage?
69.
no, ma'am. no dipshit.
tired?
but you lived.
occupied france?
mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, artoo, could fix it, if you like.
you must have gotten the last copy.
what have you done?  did you...kill someone?
you mean gandhi?
every young man should at least once...go on, laurie! read!
it's hard to see any change. but i'm going to stay. another year, anyway.
hang on! wait a minute! you can't just go and leave it like this!
carolyn!
i don't care... just get it over with.
yeah. i know.
individual whale song getting stronger... this is strange, admiral. the song is directly ahead. it's coming from san francisco.
someone tell me this is really happening.
notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
okay. remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
merry christmas, jack.
billy bear...
no. no, wait a minute. we stopped at a porno store.
he did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
you wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. so you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
we never should have done this to him...
going to turley, was it?
i'm getting a trajectory...
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
what do you mean?
i don't mind a parasite. i object to a cut-rate one.
i'll take you there.  we'll live in the sun.  you'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
mrs. mulwray?
would you care to look--in the telescope?
storm?  what storm?
yeah, morgan freeman. but he's a colored guy.
such a simple matter. this figure is the symbol of the palladists.
two officers have been assigned to the case. i can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
this feels stupid.
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel.  i will kill both him and the man who told me.
hello, miss harrington.
your honor, bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
perry como!  you had him!  go back! go back!
what did he want?
okay. never argue with a man.
bring her to starboard.
mr. gordon, did you take over this place after mrs. lippman died?
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? everybody has a scale.
what's your relationship?
eh? nothing? rachel, you bring this man to our house. with his gun of the hand. you bring fear to this house. fear of english with guns coming after. you bring blood and whispers of more blood. now english music... and you are dancing to english music! and you call this nothing?
hey, it's you.
beautiful. and what of it?  let me tell you something: so far as i'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
somebody hit you?
you're saying that i've halo'd innocent people?
...forty thousand dollars!
he's not here.  it's a blind alley.
just remember two things.  first, the law is a living thing.  it made us free and it keeps us free. sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  but in the end, the law prevails for the just. sometimes, it takes a while.
could we hear to the moon?
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison.  he can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
i want you to know how much i love you.  that you've given a meaning to my life that i had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
oh... i have some questions.
trust me, james, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
subject to the king, no doubt.
ah.
we don't know that, do we?
how old are you?
i couldn't even face that one.
what kind of show is this gonna be?
what happened?
a single room or a double room?
who?
we are lost.
yeah, the deed to the brooklyn bridge.
and the argies.
what?... what did you say?
i want to know how many of bill's books you wrote!
the people want you made dalai lama.
you... you knock the code, when you come back, ok?
i'll get something for us to drink --
not at all.
you're discharged.
who's to say you can't make things better?
i'm glad you guys are here.  it's good to see you.
you got yourself a computer, alma.
we could go to my apartment. you could see how the other half lives.
how are you?  here.  get under this.
i'm, okay... you okay?
oh, i can't.  i don't know.
shit...
for chrissakes.  you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
oh, jesus!
went over to philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
i wasn't born yesterday. i'm hurt, and i'm hurt bad.
you know lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
i <u>think</u> i see it.
well, fact or not, i don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  i can't see a thing!  let's turn back.
kristen's story really got to her.
i'm so glad you could come. here we are, all together again.
i'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. you should see the tramps coming after quincy.  if you don't talk to him...
what a nasty thing to say.
it's the same choice you made.
don't calm down.
so?
the old man's screwy!
free to come and go as you please. there's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
impressive.
your majesty!
i still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
i knew.
please do.
and how do you figure we do that?
you'd have to try real hard. no one's used currency in over ten years. what are you, from another planet?
right.  tim mason.
what?  what are you talking about? you are dying?  did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
that won't be necessary: just take me to regula i.
yes.  yes.  that's exactly it.  yes.
you know damn well it's more than that now!  how can we stop him?
admiral, you can't give him genesis...
yes, sir.
i don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
nah, east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
and as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
since i'm a kid, i had this dream... i want to own my own tropical island... beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  what's so wrong with kids?
i like popcorn...
her belongings?
grandma and grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  they didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
...in the morning.
oh, boy.
that's enough of that.
why?
what the --
you can't talk in brownsville?
no, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? you guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. you are into yourselves, as the saying goes. spend some time trying to be parents. take him to the mountains, fishing. you ought to let him get to know nature.
you, ya barrel of pork lard. here piggy piggy!
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  this is a...why?  why would you do that?
hail mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
brace yourself, gale, all of this is actually not about you.
i'm sorry we haven't met sooner, mr. gardiner. i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. i'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president.  ... tell me, mr. gardiner, just how serious is benjamin's illness? i did not want to upset mrs. rand by discussing it in detail.
i don't think so, thea. he has spoken of your mother. i don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
the world thinks andy kaufman sucks. so i was just giving 'em what they want...
i am raymond.     thank you for allowing us to stay here.
and say everything went wonderfully. a triumph-de-luxe - say that! tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
you don't want me.
watch the store while i go home and change.
you saying whitefolks won. that what you saying?
boone!  you awake?  eight o'clock.
uhura?
no biggie.
i'm sorry.  i just wanted to surprise you.  what can i say?
well, of course he is!
the roses?  and of course they said yes.
they need the money for my band uniform at school.
unless i make her one of us...
you never know. you may someday dine at the white house with the president.
well i guess there's no time like the present.  i'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
i don't understand...
how so?
i'm not the guy, harry.
why don't you tell me something for a change?
listen to yourself.  you say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so i don't care about people."  but, you're already here.  you've been here a long time.  so, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
when?
martins.
what if you have a concussion? my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. not that i could tell the difference...
you want some?
we're making an investment in havana.
go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. this is my goddam money we're talking about. get your ass out the door.
beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
what's the weather like outside?
yes.
the whitefolk?
expert! going to write a book on it. called the "hitch-hikers hail."
the coach from usc is going to be at the championship.
can i have milk too?
what do you want to do with it?
you're coming with us.
mkay.
what?
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon.  i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
where was he trying to go?
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket.
you're a good man nicholas.
i thought you said you weren't going there.
your horses are hungry, that's what she did say, come sit down beside me, an' feed them some hay. my horses ain't hungry, they wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
and when you came downstairs, what happened?
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave. by my hand.
alright, six says torch this place! blow the weapons in place. round up all suspected vee cees and shake it up! we ain't got much light left.
and?
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
someone want to tell me what's going on--
hey! do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? i usually charge for hypnosis.
do you like that?
yeah. a glorified doormat.
mama told you - i'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...my children my best thing. you my best thing!
guess what?  we show, and n.s.a. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the canadian border.  there are no nuclear devices in albania.  z'at put us in something of a pickle?  albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in the albanian hinterland.  the f.b.i. and the border patrol, and the r.c.m.p. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border.  the albanian government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  there is no war.
one pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one tx9.  we've enough food and water for three days.
what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? i thought that was your project.
that's our case!
might. might not. could say we're of two minds on the subject.
don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because i know.
we all know what you did, pike. i don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
rex saved me.
we're using-
say, you need anything, snake? guns? explosives? i can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
oh?
without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. this is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. at jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "berthier sees only what is in the open," murat said.  "but don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  and so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
that doesn't sound metal.
i'm sorry.  slip of the tongue.
delta ?
the moon -- i dunno
and i know too many people.  obviously, we're both lonely.  would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes?
hallo, peter.
i'm ready.
now you will read this into the tape recorder.
yes, sir.  we're in luck.  the sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. the apes will be hidden from the public.  they'll be quarantined. if they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  and the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. general brody's very pleased.
my father did. believe it or not, that little baby is me.
well, my wife, ester's down the hall. i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here.	she loves you so much, i just had to come down and say hello. we've been following you since you were a girl. well, i just scared you to death. i didn't mean to do that.
no. i baked them for you.
uh-huh.
get the bang sticks.  we're going down.
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, i'm coming to you out of loss. i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit i will kill. you ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
the clock's already ticking.
seance.
so josh, will you give us a ride? please? pretty please? it's going to be super fun!
i know. thanks. just don't tell anyone i have a soft side.
what?
no, why?
no, i won't let you do it.
i don't know.
how much do you know?
beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
motherfucker.  unsavory fuckin'... is there any way around this?
i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
there's a compass in the handle.
i guess you fell in the water.
this is the best part, sid. billy's got it all figured out. why do you think we kept your father alive so long? why did we save you for last?
what do you think it is?
maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  but the female, she's the key.  she's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  the one who takes care of the other two.
put me down, you son of a bitch!
well, i'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
aren't you going to say, 'i told you so'?
you guys have any skills at all?
huh?
this isn't going to work.
claire...
buckaroo, come in...over.  how does this damn thing work?  can anybody figure this lighter out?
i'd seen you writing in that book. at the embassy in cairo, when i had thumbs and you had a face. and a name.
well.  see.  that was a... reflex to see if it would...
we can say whatever we want. we can shout... we can complain... look...  the service in this hotel is terrible!  see? nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. that's freedom.
no, i can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. this is as private as we'll get.
fine.  the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man.
what the hell for?
you take your money, too seriously, bo.
i'll pick you up in a half an hour.
come on!
i never said i was.
we just want --
is that a fact?
do you?
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
aw, i don't know what you're talking about. all i know is that you're losing your bank and—
...fishin'.
yeah?!
i know em, i don't know what order they come in...
talk.  no tricks, no codes, no messages.  you haven't found us. it was a fake call.
i dunno.  lie on the beach?
it must've grabbed us.  that's why the truck stalled-out.
direct hit. he's resetting his shield harmonics...
see, that's your problem, frank. by the time you finish figuring out stuff, i'm already finished doing it.
go to lunch, will you...
nothing.  it wasn't anything.  i've been on edge lately.  maybe since the accident. and i'd prefer, i really would, to just--
fine.  we'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  by the way, how're you fixed for spys?
forget it.  we work for it.  we keep it.
dorothy next!
i don't have to look at anything. i don't have --
damn right i'm right.
that was billy ansel on the phone. he wants to come over to talk to us.
i know that.  you think i don't know that? "i know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio.  on the other hand, maybe i'm just losing my mind."
come sir galahad, quickly!
oh, heavens i must say... no, no actually, i can't - tatiana has refused to see any more girls.

what cold? and after the show, we could go out on the town --  i've been taking from arthur murray.
andy?... what? what is it?  andy... are you okay?
you gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
apparently he has the letters.
i'll never understand your regard for them, charles.
you don't believe me?  you don't fucking believe me?
i didn't know. i saw him die. i believe he's dead. christ
.... i'm afraid there's not much left.
watch your mouth.
then you've seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno.
unlock these cuffs.
it must have been once too often. i think your brains come apart. what you got up there, chinese bells?
oh my fullness, as i explained to you before, i am about the best there is. second best there is.
anything to do before i go home?
liar.  did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of superman's hair!
i was in the basement fixing the pipes.  would you believe that?
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality?
&quot;those who travel far and near this will make you disappear!&quot;
why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
was that your dad?
why?
just give me a hint, all right?
what're you writing, lois?
is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
mcmanus wants to go in shooting. i said no way.
claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  they're not giving milk.
i talk to her or you can forget about it.
since when did he drink whisky?
i told you not to try anything smart!  i guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  and that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
yes.
what do you mean "brought it bowling"? i didn't rent it shoes.  i'm not buying it a fucking beer.  he's not gonna take your fucking turn, dude.
any leads?
then why do you stay?
llewelyn.
...so you tie your own flies, ed. i mean, if you're really serious. you tie your own flies, you do a--i know it's matickless, i know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, ed, you see what i'm saying?
what happened?  you got fired, huh?
because he was cruel?
because you'll never believe me.
you're late.
well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
nichts danke. kein.
if i don't see it in front of me, you're right. it ain't shit.
what's wrong?
exactly what i mean.  it's all ruined.
what are you afraid of?  nobody's asking you to have a baby.  this is just to get out of town. the minute we hit florida, we'll blow this set-up.
ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
they changed the layout -- whadda they call you? mr. monster? they remodeled the place. when i worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
because i can deliver the actual noc list.  the one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
eh, forget it.  what else is big?  teenagers!  jailbait pics!  yeah... you got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
mass production is what does it.
it can't be.  not helen.
what? i was at sandy's i just lost track of time.
[aside] shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this?
that's not what we were taught. 'look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
i just got here myself, susan.
hmmm.
we don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
i was lookin' for you all day today.
dristan nasal spray.
you were all supposed to leave.  you weren't supposed to stay down here.
christ, ken, you know it's not that easy.
at the ranch maybe?
ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands. indian reservation.
-- well, maybe two-seventeen.
why? he can't help us.
well, naturally. of course.
we set?
you were eavesdropping.
i'm just tired.
you know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and i'm afraid the ticket was in it. but the name's pearson.
no.
all right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  okay?
she was right to leave me.
that's your problems the more women think, the more trouble they get into.
i bet that macy struthers had a hand in this.  we'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
are you getting that black suit?
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. i mean. dr. bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
she's even better looking in the flesh.
tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
well, i'm on the bum; i'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. but not tonight. if you won't drink with me, i'll drink alone, tonight. 
yes, mary patrick?
forgive the butterfingers, buckaroo.  casper lindley, knight of the blue shield, at your disposal.  and my son, scooter.
immortality.
but i am not human. i am only -
you mean like techniques?
"graverobbers from outer space"! it's <u>money in the bank</u>.
play it.
what's the point of my setup? it's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
alex, i don't have the time --
make it my first born.
thought you were hungry!
i'm serious...this - this is a great american film.  full of violence and sex.  and i want my credit.
you're back, boychick.
dad, look what i drew.
you okay?
and where are they going with it?
private.  i'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
not that i don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--i wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
what'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
what is it?
damn right i'm done.  i'm going to ask for a mistrial and i'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. i'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass.
vince d'agosta.  am i out?
what did he say?
i need to ask you a question.  what made you get in touch with joanne braslow?
if they're going to poke fun at me, i'm going to—
not that far, only halfway.  you sure you know what you're doing?
not all...i needed another four months and i would have had them all.  i guess you've figured it all out?
i've stared into the face of evil...  ...and i've lived to tell the tale. now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew...
herman scobie. and you've never seen him before, either?
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency. why?
i'm terribly sorry.  he doesn't seem to be here ... no ... yes, if i see him, i will. .. goodbye. she's going to phone back.
i guess not.
so, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
what's your problem now, lieutenant ?
like mother, like son....
what about her? you didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
half.
what the fuck is going on here?
wanna know what i think?
oh, god! here yuh go! oh, good, now he'll think-  aaaah! okay.
god, your sister's really hot.
i told you i was a little bit out of step.  a lot of the old stuff i listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
what's that?
the incredible thing about it is, i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed.
vaughn.
es mi novia. [she's my girlfriend.]
i mean it -- you got enough money now. head out for california. surf's up, jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
i am an enchanter.
i know.  but then i reconsidered.  'cause i figured out what i really wanna do with my life, what i want to do for a living is i wanna be with your daughter.  i'm good at it.
why not.
like i always do?
want to walk out... or get thrown out?
congratulations.  who with?
and how does one do that?
have you ever know a woman? do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
baxter?
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
well, i haven't seen any. i wouldn't worry about it. look, i better go.
even the bedchamber passages!  let none remain!
captain, the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
am i what they had in mind?
a month from today?
just a moment... if i may.  it is possible this man was murdered.
this ain't no drill, slick.  make me proud.
tell me about doctor paley?
line it up now, nice and easy...
i guess i left it in my room.
then i will go with you.
you really look awful.
that's the point, isn't it?
toddy hates me.
or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  i mean, he liked laura too, i didn't mean that.  and he likes you.  it's just that --
look, look, look....  he's fine, as long as he has his medication.
shit.
how long have you and hambone been hangin' out?
he thinks this is some kind of game!
fuck you! you know, i'll call the police.
buff is funny, okay? she likes buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
did you hear what i said?
right.  we have the same blood type...
no, you didn't. they found william starks' body dead in the snow.
used to be against the law, didn't it?
...doing?!
help me.
that's the key to the city of pasadena, which mr. lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
sorry to here it.
fair enough. what'll we talk about at dinner?
look, i'm sorry to bother you but i was wondering if you could help me out.
what do you want?  a statement of purpose... ?
one other thing. about this kid, this student of yours -- leer -- james leer. you wouldn't know how i could get in touch with him, would you?
we could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
if you knew, leon...!  i killed one thousand in my head...  and this never disturbed my sleep.
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
sorry, sorry.
oh, god. that's two more than me. tell me it gets better.
orson, hold on. look into my eyes. tell me you are not doing hearst.
i don't doubt their involvement, bill, but at a low level.  could the mob change the parade route, bill, or eliminate the protection for the president?  could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back?  could the mob get the fbi, the cia, and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation?  could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up?  could the mob wreck the autopsy?  could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep? and since when has the mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? the mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  this was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings.
we're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
at least i'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
we ran out without my shoes and the floor.  i gotta get my stuff.  what about our savings?
that's a shame, john.  a real shame.
mmmerrick.
why did you do these things, donnie? did frank tell you to commit these crimes?
...this close...
my mom taught me when i was little.  did you ever hear of the dream master?
what do you make of it, margo?
when are you coming home?
and even nicer when there's a man around, which isn't all that often.
fuckin a, i think i got two partial prints here!
lungs sound fine.  you didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  allergies? infections?
he's <u>dead</u>.  he's <u>dead</u>.  the fella killed old shoe. 
no.
there is?
you're going to force us... huh?
well?
what the fuck are we doing out here? somebody call the police! we need help!
yes, sir, that's the truth. but don't blame him. the fault is mine. i was too indulgent with him. but not again. never again, i promise! i implore you - let me bring him back here. i'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
that's to bad.
uh... wha?  you're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  i take it a woman named colleen sutton is not your big sister and that the late d.j. johnny crunch ain't your daddy?
what does it look like?  it's an address book!
please, sheriff.  you'll see we dug it up.
great.
pardon, good mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
feeling better?
hello, liz.
i've seen your television commercials. "if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... it should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
so am i.
she was with me.
not bad. just regular.  you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
i could save you the trouble.
the deuce you say.  that crate!
she's cool.
i hope it's the right kind.
that's impossible. michael myers is an invalid.
general greene is here.  there are two other divisions here.
... took everything i ever cared about. left me with nothing.
i like what you've done with it. when's captain nemo moving in?
that's worse... just get out of here. walk out, leave everything.
where are you going?
you're from detroit, near where i come from. you majored in education at tuskegee. you're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
then we'll be safe?
the <u>closet</u>?! have you lost all sense of reality?
is this your house?
i knew you two pricks would give me problems. give me shit cause i'm a woman. i'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
nothing sticks to slime, emily.  this should cover what you lent me.
sure, what's wrong with that?
get over here.
she's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. the noise alone kept me up.
no.
mr. deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. it is, to say the least, most uncommon.
the more the merrier.
do you love your parents?
oh. that's her name. patricia. like mine. i was pat and she was patty. but she changed it after seeing "some like it hot." to marylin. after marylin monroe.
yeah.
what's he doing?
there are some things that are unclear. we need to talk.
here's a news flash, ray. we never were friends. we've just been stuck together for 12 years. it's been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you. every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if i'd never bumped into ray gibson.
how long were you with the dog? alone, i mean?
what do you think?
bones, are you afraid of the future?
look... search your own records, if you prefer. you can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. if we find buffalo bill through your information, i'll suppress it. nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
hello, jimmy. what's up?
no, i don't mind. i'm not from here. i was born in italy.
it's not cool?
out of self comes selflessness.
that information is classified. you're there to gather information on their operations, period.
yeah, i know, i went back and forth on it.
he --
no?
six-toed cats. assyrians. abyssinians. it's the same difference. well don't think this terry malloy is any six-toed cockeyed assyrian. he's a bum. charley and johnny friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
you're the one always saying 'just do it'.
so where is young jonah?
i hope he fell off.
here's your ticket, ma'am.
what did you tell him about the baby?
oh.  ah, i'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am i?
you've already made arrangements!?
mr.wallace brown is in the executive building on the second floor. we want to go in and turn right at the first street. then we want to walk three blocks down past stage 17 to the white executive building. once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. now do we have name?
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
why are you here. whatiya want?
captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
the brother of charley the gent. they'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
they ain't got captains?
you shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. i'll take it.
what makes you think i could do that?
some nuts? some licorice? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
hi mom.
of course.
what -- what are you doing?
is he still working here ?
i have to know where you come from.
i understand you searched brett for it last night. by the way--what do you know about him?
what, lewis?
i'll drive you --
as appealing as that sounds...
she must have her little joke.  you're not going to take that seriously.
why not buy them milk or something-- instead of dr. pepper?
superman broke your monster, uncle lex.
you will do as i tell you. you will try to reach ynyr, the old one.
no. thanks.
you better watch your mouth, man, or i'll punch your lights out.
if you get a safe shot...
the "old man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
we're talking about marseille. we're talking about nykwana wombosi. and i'm asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone.  was this treadstone?
does she have a name?
i think i already have.  but now she won't even talk to me.
i'm glad you've come home, conner.
sustained.
you are a fine figure of a man.
to be killed in battle?
that would be my guess.
yeah, we have mr. morris levine's eightieth birthday party on riverside drive...or riverside memorial chapel, depending on his health.
they can't convict us of that. you proved our innocence. besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
life knocked me back.
okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
and, now?
what for?  we've got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
july of '71.
nobody touches me.
yeah, i've seen him.
sure, right.
i don't remember. but off the top of my head, i'd say black.
she knows. clever, very clever.  and unappreciated. but i'm going to take you away from all this.
what about picard?
doug...you wouldn't shoot me, would you?  after all we've been through?
well, now there's something worth dying for.  what do you think?
my god, lenny.  what is it?
anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. but--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new beemer.
you're not -- dorothy.
are you worried about tomorrow night?
general mann -- i was told to expect you, sir.  i'm colonel heffner.
what good'll that do? smoke's as bad as birds.
....you have it...easy....you know? you have a father who loves you, huh?
oh, laura.
helen's going to be pissed.
when was that?  in the swamp at the expense of your men?  or when he killed thomas at the expense of your family?
oh, that's all right with me. i won't hold it against you. but you see, i'm here to find out about—
yes? ms. woods?
this is - what is this?
forget it; i'm suddenly without an appetite.  you're making big trouble, carmine.
where'd you pick up your checks?
mom, please
i hate to see you cringe in front of him.  how come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
ooh!
yes... after her death, it was intolerable for me here... the future had to be better.
jesus christ.  that's a real blockbuster.  i always figured you guys had it made.
he's dead? am i bad luck or what?
i'm so humiliated.  i don't know what to say.  i mean--
the husband steps outside; relinquishes his bride; we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride. 
i hate to say it...
it's contraband.  don't ask.  but i wanted to give you a treat.  a sort of... thank-you gift.
you have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
shoulda guessed.
i've seen lots of people.  it's not a big thing for me.
we're going to vegas.
we'll do it together.  i'll clue you in.  timing's got to be right.  the old man says it's up to joe.
this is great, honey.  the orange. has it got a little vodka in it? like that finnish stuff, orange vodka --  put your lips around this one, bill. it's out of this world.
no, i'm not...
what happens?
what do you mean?
you must be planning on doing some hunting.
i have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
i often do.
i'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
exposure. they can't have it. they wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
there's another beam!
are you sure this is the river road?
it's finally over.
look, i love you katka but i'm twelve years older, i could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
you stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  i was iced.  what better way to keep me from talking.  stop me if i'm wrong.
but you don't hate him.
jimmy? bushmills.  lookit, do me a favor. i'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
now--turn around, if you would.
well...
you flatter me.
where's that?
it's your grass.
what do you want now?
okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the white house! jumpin' jesus! i want everyone there. our people. locals. orders are shoot to kill. repeat! shoot to kill!
oh, yeah?
what about our grenades?
be at the state house, courtroom nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
could we cut all news off? i know --
a lot that means.
can i do it? i just broke her cherry. i imagine i can make her do anything. bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
you're very kind...
there's nothing?
no.
was that what they tried to do? was that why daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
...i can't remember.
what's that, a gram?
but this is so humiliating.
hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
a friend dropped me off.
here comes the cow ca-ca....
i'll come.
do i really want to know what you're talking about?
in-in... alvy, in my dream frank sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and i can't breathe.
you tell your friends your father used to work the docks. callused hands. but you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
where's erica? you seen her?
on what?
i'm going to disappear. i die in a car crash in taiwan. very easy to do.
so. this is the guy you been waiting for. man of your dreams.
if you're making fun of me, i don't like it.
when?
"no." first thing you've said in the last four hours. that's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. that's a geyser. i mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. shit, i'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
carmine left?
it's all right. i'll forward your mail.
we don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. judge brandeis said it best: entrapment is a "dirty business!"
hell, yeah. she's not my unicorn.
promise you won't kill me, first.
i hate scary movies.
why would i want to sell my passport?
he's going back.
been drinking since high school. fucked himself up.  used to be smart enough.
i had the four o'clock shift. you weren't there. you had us worried. is everything okay?
there are three types of casino in the u.k. high volume. small faction. and motr. that's middle of the road. us.
jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. i've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i've got her money.
i've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
i can see the shed from here!  we can make it if we run!
help!
ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  i mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. you won't be publishing.  you won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
where's doctor mccoy?
why would i kill her?
i can't jack. how can i?
and i'm overwhelmed.  and i want to do it justice.  and i hope we can spend time together.  and i'm gushing.  it's my worst quality.
i don't believe it.
what i have to say must be said to all concerned.  it is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
fifteen, at the most.
no.
hurt feelings department.
no, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
aye, sir.
this was last month. so alan stanwyk does not have cancer.
what's-her-name moved to buffalo.
... hey, somebody!  open up, it's me, macready...  ... come on, damn it... the towline snapped.  been crawling around like a seal out here...
it's okay really, i was just a baby.
and now you, another victim of the modern age. but you can be helped. i phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
hey, look out, a bee!
we'll get 'em--  so you livin' out here now?
kevin!  you seen shitbreak lately?
i'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
he?
leo strauss...  i've got to go to boston. i came to say goodbye.
no, i'm just going to head home.
character, hmmpf! that's your idea?
they look a right load of wallies. patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' household cavalry.  watch it.
let's just say i'm sending a very clear message to his re—election rally...
there's other things to be learned.
god bless ya, rock.
no, they're not from wendy.
what's to be scared about?  it's just a little hiccup in the power.
who was this fuckin' guy?
give it to me!  yes!
i guess.
what i asked you earlier?
you know what i mean.
but mr. webster...you're doin' okay with brazil and them other places. what's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
that was an ark, man. that was a torah. they fucked around with it, and the torah melted their faces.
i do?
what happened?  i'm sorry, sir, i must have taken a bad step...
what did you hear?
it was incomprehensible. what was god up to? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god's gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! was it possible i was being tested? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? that was very possible. all the same, why him? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts. i couldn't stop them.
get lost.
rats?
what's wrong?
i already called for an ambulance.
tell them to go!
so this is it, right?
you sure you passed on my message?
anybody see ya?
i've got to be honest with you.  i met someone else.  i've met someone else.  i...i told you i wasn't going to wait forever.
he just asked me questions.
come on, professor. the army's not gonna give you any answers. you'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
naw, you didn't let me down.  it was a long shot all the way.  we gave 'em a good run at it.
take it easy.  everything's all right.  i put it on syphon, on the nose.
billboards about accidents.  kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. it all felt...just wrong. just like... 
he doesn't make sense to me either, chewie.
no, i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. besides, i always travel alone.
you worry about me really?
ouch... of course i want off the case.  some monster from woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  the fact i'm alive's a technicality.
she is a dancer! and a lovely one! you would like her very much! shall we dance?
i want his name.
a what kind of doctor?
but the raves about your performance-
to your family.
the only thing which exists is myself.
come in.  hi.
sorry i didn't get her back in time.
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car?
no. not just a track. you gotta listen to the trees, man. to the leaves. to this sand, you fbi's kicked all up. you gotta listen to the earth.
i won't leave you like this.
is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
he's getting married... and we're nuts!
is this nick mason!!??
are you sure?
nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?
i can't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences.  i've learned so much.
every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
this is real cooperation. i appreciate it.
more... many more.
miss beaufort has accepted our invitation.  by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
you've wasted enough of my time, fella.
well?
warp two... three...
it was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
got it.  ejection seat?
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  we're doing well?
thank god for that.
no one would come out here unless they had business. and no one would have business with me except for you. you're buying the town.
the 'question' --
this is not the first time the dark ones have attacked our world. they came once before, a thousand years ago. a young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. my fore-father was their councilor, as i will be yours.
young man -- you got me there.
...you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in fairbanks in a few hours.
oh! oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. listen, dorothy, don't let hunk kid you about miss gulch. she's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. you know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
candle wax.  car wax.  mustache wax? could be anything.  guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  gets sand in it.  wipes it off with a shoe.  shoe scuffs the counter.
yes sir.  what's that?
what did you want to see me about, mr. bartholomew?
well, that certainly won't do.
what is it you got between you?
he already knows everything about what he can't do.  you can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
listen. have i got a proposition for you, superman. i mean i owe you one, you know? now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
another thing i can't stand is ...when white house reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "white house" sources say...
hey, guttierez?
i'm sorry, bull. it's never easy. he was a good soldier.
i'm holding your hand!
you're so bossy.
who asked you?
you're smashed, vanessa.
mr. deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
take this, it'll help you sleep.
are you kidding?
did they tell you to sleep with me?
have you seen the oasisburg police? they drive golf carts with little red sirens.
healthy as can be.
what a cozy little scene.
get this thing off me.
doc, these are my friends. we're superheroes, and we need your help.
oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
how's the rest of your health?
look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
redi's all right.
you see the paper?
"before i kill you."
we run they'll shoot us anyway.  if we keep driving they might think we friendlies; iraqis.  or even if they know we're americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
i'd nearly given up on you.  i was about to leave.  i do have other clients.
hey, good morning, barry.
there' no reason for name calling.
they are useless! it was kirk i needed. and i let him slip away.
for reading.
why did you agree to come in then?
why?
you did.
why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
may i? too bad about those two german couriers, wasn't it?
i don't want to talk about it.
we have had fun, you and i. fun for a little boy in an old palace.
he's in the dumps, sir.  agnew.  every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. he's become the most hated man in america.
should we talk to trini about paying these guys?  or maybe chotiner?
no. what you usually say, i guess.
just one kiss. for old times' sake.
really, though. my thoughts go haywire sometimes.
how long have you been freelance?
something they can hold in their hands.
okay, barbie, let's get this over with.
can i call my mom? i'd like to tell here how much i've always loved her.
i'm busting outta this place.
what's suck night?
wow. i never knew she had these kind of feelings.
here he is.
i'm sorr--goddamn mario brothers. goddamn gates.  goddamn rutherford auction house.  by the way, how many seconds?
i quit.
majesty, may i ask you to do me the greatest favour?
how old are you?
we come watch... we come watch...
good for you, hank.
did you see that!? grasshoppers! billions of grasshoppers!
i didn't count the days.
that's right.
can i get you something to drink?
how are you getting along with pinta?
there's only one thing that will stop the martians!  we've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  now there's no choice.  the united nations has voted authority to the united states.  the white house will confirm an order to use the atom bomb.
roz? rosomoff?  what is it?
i've been waiting for you, baby.
it was moderate.  he'll be all right.  but it was out of the question, his coming along.
were you going somewhere tonight, jeff?
who?
and what did he say?
then answer the question. same category.
uh huh.
he killed that guy without feeling anything.
how in hell does it wind up?
i think he's still alive. he's got claret coming out of him somewhere. what did they want with a traffic warden?
that's enough.
and bring the cocktail shaker.
you know, i noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  i could sense the chemistry between us.
you're an original, joe.  a little hard to figure, maybe...
i made no such promise.  sound the retreat for the night!
well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and i'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   and the best to marion...  where have <u>you</u> been?
what if she forgets?
i know what you are thinking.  i'm not going to disappear, okay?  i'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  i got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
what you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
you're all safe. thanks be to god!
where have you been'? you missed my shining moment. i won the macaroni sundae binge.
he ain't eating beans fer lunch.
what do you mean?
damn you!
do you even know who terry valentine is?
paine lent me one of your books; "oklahoma kid," i think it was. read a bit of it... think it's pretty good. what made you take up this sort of thing? been doing it for long?
i felt like black.
it depends where you sit zozo. in coach it is like the bus to giterama.
miles, how nice of you to see us -- may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil.
she does at that.  i knew when i married her she was a free spirit.  a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect?  but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. so, i married her.  what are you to do, eh? women.
i said keep your nose out of my life. no kid is going to tell me how to run it.
breaker. breaker.
nobody cares, ronald.
and baaaaaaa! back on you.
home... new york?
this will take some time.
doesn't work on you.  see ya around, little brother.
that's good.
no.  the numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. it's a book code.  and your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not lecktor talking to him.
funded by whom?
i'll have to know a little more than that.
having an adventure. i can't tell you about it right now, but i'll tell you about it soon.
my god, what do you think?
listen, that was my fault.
do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
yeah?
don't want any of those looks, col. they don't mean much.
hurry! she's lost it!
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
brother earl.
my name is sidney winch, and -
but i was baptized.  and i certainly wasn't born of incest.
i can't walk two blocks in washington without hearing about "g.i. jane."  you're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
his journal. he sent it to me the day before he died. everything about you is in it. the blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. let's see, then there's your coke problem... you still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? it's all in there.
where is it?
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
i'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. maybe i should get a real complete physical. you give alan an annual, don't you?
jesus.  what is this?
what?
<u>you</u>?
sehen sie da gleich da unter. da unten ist est passiert. passiert - english.
according to dr. darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  q.e.d.
was he a relative? or an intimate friend?
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
you can't do that!  you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? they don't waste time...
yep. quite a day.
ow!
are we going to sleep now?
what?
what had you to do with this, mother?
i was going to fix you breakfast.
i been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. i can't raise it on the radio either. makes me think it might be in trouble.
you know that gal?
got it.
fuck off, dave.
i don't know, i guess i never really thought about it...  is larry here?
i pay auggie, and i've got nothing. eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city.
oh . . . me? oh, well, i feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
we all are, data. but we're going to get him back.
nobody's done so much, eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases... what is it?
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
why do i have to do this?
i guess i ... if i jumped to...
well, you were pretty great!
you don't have any money put away, do you?
that's all.  you see, in sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  if he was a traitor.
cease fire. look sharp.
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth.
i'm sorry.
let's go all the way.
sure thing.
what is it?  what's going on?  where are we?
so modest.
cotton balls.  i found them just inside the meat locker door.
i'll tell you what's gotten into me. i don't know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said i'd check it out and i did. now i don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i don't like it.
i want to stop aging.
why not?
mr. barboni is a good customer.  works for jimmy capp.
frogs?
shakespeare never said that.
of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  and pricks.  hard, arrogant pricks --
i didn't ask for any help. did you, linda?
he'll wait --
"you can't know the horrible disappointment i feel..."
so am i.  alright, i'll go inside and you cover the back.
you gotta believe me –
oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. thank you. mister...?
program name?
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc, wyatt.  i don't know if he's gonna make it.
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  not this lane. not today.
you don't know anything!  listen colon, these are my ships, right? so i'm telling you we're turning back!
no... a little. there's a lot of debate about it.
you don't expect us to believe that do you?
where's harry?
...what can i say after i say that i'm sorry?  i zipped when i should've zagged, i opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
why not?
where?
help yourself.
make it bergdorf goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, max? done up in little ribbons. i could die right now and nobody'd be confused. how about you, max?
hello.
kit... maybe i'd better get a shovel.
hi, uh, excuse me. i'm here to see mr. reuben.
... yes.
what are you going to do?
are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the gamin' control board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like nicky santoro?
found what?
yes, ma'am.
we worked in chinatown together.
i don't know. one of these days, i'm gonna see louis. my back's killing me.
she's an officer.  there's a higher standard.
i don't - 
you think that'll help?
motherfucker!!
who ?
excuse me.  i didn't mean to disturb....  what am i saying?
isn't everybody? what can i do for you, miss sessions?
that's right, miss packard.
the happy hunting ground.  who cares?
i needn't keep you any longer, mr. clarendon.
goodnight.
let's all make a vow. let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
i don't get it.
commander? are you still there?
i am such a goose.  i mistook you for cecil beaton.  it's the hat. you're wearing one of cecil's hats, you know.
crazy.  go along bayswater...
better than cousteau, or compagno with computers, telemetry, defense department funding...
so?
ph.d., psychologist.
well, no. but he had to escape the nazis.
we all have that dream.
come on.
no -- i'm sorry. it's not possible.
i don’t think so, thank you...
there's a lot i can't tell you, tom. i know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  but it is because i do trust you that i've kept so much secret from you.  it's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that i can completely trust.  in time, you'll understand everything.
you're the one who doesn't care, phil.
the--head?
i'm sorry, mr. dean. but larry's in st. lukes now, so i'm a little--i'm not myself. the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
tonight we return once again to the cave. tonight we let the monsters out. we fill ourselves with the spirits of genghis khan, joe namath, jfk, paton, lombardi, hemingway...
the young man leaned back in his chair. no bulls would die today.
but dad, you guys truly hated each other, i mean really hated each --
your sister is an unbelievable cook.
fuck.
you just put mustard on your hershey bar.
early, what're you doin'?
no, no... not that kind of... underground. more a private... business. private.
yeah, here, i mean, where else?
i need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  meet the people.
he wants your wisdom.
psst! hey, martini, wake up!
i still think you're a bastard.
naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
what else makes you feel regret?
morning mr. north
you know it's not like that --
when did you see him -- what time, i mean?
oh, shit!  well, hang on!
you're not going anywhere.
eddie, which dress do you like better?
come on. one more time.
dumont... my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
no.
about the ship...
then just help me find a girlfriend! that's all i ask. i'll give you every single card i've got left!
nine?
you kind of have to start with elvis costello, but where? "motel matches?" "i want you?" "i hope you're happy now?" "green shirt?" his records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "where did you sleep last night," sure, but by robert johnson or by nirvana?  maybe a liz phair track.  there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. some devil's advocate stuff.  the silver jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  but i think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  ah.  dylan. bob fucking dylan.  now bob dylan would --the phone rings.  he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
yeah, i know.  but never to exist again!
i thought you were supposed to keep them.
a warming wind.
it's all right, alfred. everything's under control.
thanks. good night, mrs. mitchell.
what do you want from me?
the point is, they want a man inside.
do you have the money?
let me out.
what do you say, jake?  should we trust her?  no?  i didn't think so.
darryl.
you go shoot me if you want, vincent, but you'll be dead before i hit the ground.
. or do you just want me? i'm going to let you enter me now.
huh?
they never hurt me? they hurt me every day with their attitude. you know, like they even have a right. who the fuck do they think they are? let me tell you something, i was born here. alright? i'm an american. and i'm owed something. look, they took it from me.
close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
marcel?
how much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
what's your point, walter?
oh boy.
you see!  there hasn't been a true word -
you know him?
you just go inside, homer. we don't need no help.
they brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
number one.  she hates smokers
... can't you see...?  if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth. nothing could stop it!  nothing!
i haven't decided.
the laws of god are higher than the laws of man.
beeeee careful.
you guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
but they...they could still be....
like my mother.
sold it, stole it, whatever...
if we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
i'm gonna need some money.
still nothing from the colony?
nothing... i should never have left him...
what is this place?
and do what? live alone? go back to school? find someone else? start a magazine for confused woman? ... what if i can't do any of those things?
this is fat sam, and this is gummy. 
well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! they're playin' it as far away as mobile! the whole damn state's goin' ape!
your client have a deal in long beach? how about downtown?  there's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  any of this ring a bell?
i know that.
the war is over. this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
i think i'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
hey, dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
it is possible... and i know this isn't something you want to hear. your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  she might have wanted to tell you something...
it's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must've cost dr. gaskell a lot.
m'sieu laval, there are several things i've wanted to ask you for quite a while. i understand you are from marseilles.
my recommendation: do me. don't take the chance that i'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick. would if i were you.
do you take risks?
piggyback ride.
well, well!  what is it?  we'll make you used to our ways, or adopt english ones.
yeah, come on in.
i'm okay.
stand by on the rov.
i'm trying to quit.
love it!
it doesn't matter who they are.
i found verdell, mr. udall.
no chance of that.
maid's night off?
was she married or something?
nineteen zero and nine.
how about you?  got a bar mitzvah this weekend?
let's be reasonable human beings here. we're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
uh, well, anyway, so i'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. i wrote to derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. but everything's still kind of in development at this point.
dad!
approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. it's absurd.
happy birthday, lainey.  do you like it?
fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
the judge came up with a number.
i don't care.
rose, this is waski. his real name is warren but we call him waski. he doesn't like it much and i suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
so you see, our task isn't made any easier by ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
alright!
you can let him out on bail, can't you?
consider grace, the kids. i love them like my own. and you.
i know, but  --
you fellas got names?
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that's what i would've done.
joe, i can't look at you any more.
it's a beautiful day in tuscarora - i don't envy you that humidity in the city.
what brings you back?
ever since that phony phone call from the president.  look at this. what is it?
something i got to ask you, marty. i've been very very careful. have you been very very careful?
come on, get up.  that horse is carrying too much of a load.
come on, pop.
that's nice. all we have is a japanese beetle trap.
if you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, i let guys stand around and watch. it's a lot cheaper.
oh my god! you're rick derris?
machismo?
my notes.  observations.  clues.
i see a ring on your finger.  you have any kids?
we want to help...!
how do we get upriver?
and we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
bathroom over there?
i don't, but...
loop around real fast.
it's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. the part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. they didn't know about it back in the sixties. even now, it's not understood very well.
m- uh, mr. and mrs. rothstein?
take at look at it.
* thank you.							    *
of course it is.
norman, get out of there now! norman?
oh, god, i <u>knew</u> it was stupid, i <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. but the gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. right on top of the bag. yes. yes. we took the gameboy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
of human bondage.
mr. kross, i'm not here to sell you my stock.  on the contrary, i'm here to buy yours.
you mean i'd get a chance to talk to her?
really?
no. but that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
oh.  well, where do we start?
destiny takes a hand.
okay.
i'd give anything to have been there.
oh no, it's been much more than that.
i'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. if you want me to pick you up, i will.
it's okay, i'm all right.  i remember now... it was an animal.  something large!  i could smell it.  it was hunting me.  i saw two green eyes in the dark.
do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
goddamn, miles, she is nasty. nasty nasty nasty.
do you?
i'm impressed.
now robert is dead. he got his revenge.
aramis, porthos and athos too.  i know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your majesty.  if their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. forgive them.
you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
i was kept pretty much in the dark. i didn't know all that much.
meat.
i'm so sorry.
i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
well dad, actually i thought i'd take the morning train on thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
yes.
that's too bad.
it's in michigan. honestly, what do i have in common with those people? or with anyone?
what are you doing?
well, those guys share everything, right?
but it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
do you love me?
don't tell me what i --
doctor...
i've been watching. we were fine 'till she came. she brought the devil here.  there was blood on her hand that night.
burke!  open the door!
excuse me, i think the word you're searching for is space ranger.
along with mr. mulwray.
then what?
i'm afraid his car is gone, mrs. fortune.
it's a good thing no one's irish here.
you read me, brewer?
him?  oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
no shit.  they expensive?
i'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
just low.
that guy's not going to make it.
"go back to your banana tree, nigger." no use telling them i came from tottenham.
with light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
so, mark's working at the state department now.
you know him?
packing.
i know. that's the amazing part of it. i mean, it wasn't like cirque du soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. i'm going to sound like a hallmark card.
god-damn you!
the creator is that which created v'ger.

i'd hate her to grow up like that.
you're beautiful.  marry me.

you'd better be quiet, sandy.
seven...
you said that boyd.
right.  why not?
no, it's impossible... no one, and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system... i'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  you're aboard the wrong ship, son!

jesus.  you done this before?
yes -- what is it?
would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?

alone?

tuttle! ... mumble!  you've had that scab tuttle here, haven't you?
if they say they love it, they'll probably love it. not everybody lies, you know?
you have to meet bess.
here you go, pete.
yeah, that's what happened with me too.
i'm not smiling.
you've lied to me twice - i'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  these men are experts.
unusual?  i don't know.  i haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
oh, baby. i'm sorry. can't you hire somebody else?
well listen, i know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.

annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while i'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  she also said i should throw whatever pitches you call for.
they are not my clients.
why you hang around with them greasers?
i don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
well... it's the men, sir.  they wonder how you know our position. we've lost sight from land days ago...
hi.
well i guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard per-gola. you can stand up in it. well, some people could stand up in it. six foot clearance at the ridge. you might just could.
they wouldn't take it.
i'm sorry. that's the wrong answer.
sure there are--and i've tried them all.  plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
what?
well, annie, your place or mine?
a week? a year?
nobody's got clean kids.
i'm never going back!
it's about time you give my young friends a visit, chris. tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and i can't have that now, can i, chris?
i dunno.
i know very little about demons, ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,  this is the 20th century. we don't see demons now.
how you know that?
they say richard low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
why would they exaggerate?
what are you doing?
jennyhaydn.
you're damn right i'm serious....
we don't have anything like this. or the machine where kalen found you.  and i doubt they do beyond the valley... now where do you come from?
he's not coming.  watch.  he's not coming.

not a soul.
eric!
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale. we'll have a lot of laughs. when i send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
jack... i feel like such an idiot. it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
oh no.
you mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
yes, that sudden.  if it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  it's all your fault.
look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little od won't surprise anybody. it's the only way we can be together.  you know it's true.
what have you done?
torch it over there!

my mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
what do you mean?

their minds are so.... they move in strange directions....
you trying to take over my show finnegan, that what you trying to do?
even if i weren't.
no, cole, i...
working hard?
jack was a shame, but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  through his whore girl friend.  i sent him to make the buy.  the rest is history.
i think i'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
upstairs.
hello, mrs. worley.
i need the money.
now for the real question.
whatever suggested the idea to you?
how did they get away?
sir, you did it.
what's up?
i know. i know.
you wanna hear a nasty story of mine? it's kind of sexual.
you know, we didn't call any tv repair.

he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
no!  you take another step, i'll shoot!  they're trying to kill me...
he's right on the heading.
i figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  hey, i loved it too.  a chance to be a part of something important. something bigger than yourself.
dentist?  we been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

your mother.
i've just come back from the hospital. your victim has died.
freddy newendyke.
you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. it doesn't work, sebastian.
a sauciere --
yeah, well, she's our girl now.  i think we better keep an eye on her.  there's trouble there.  hey, listen to this.  ethel and bert lane. married seventy-five years.  you believe that?
you really think so?  did you tell him you were pregnant?
mr. dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
i hear you're tryin' to organize this place!

i don't want you to let go.

jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus.  and suddenly, i wasn't sure.  we talked when i was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. the drugs and stuff.  you think maybe i'm the one who wiped out the human race?  it was my idea?
yeah, borrowed!
what?
nothing. it's just that... i picked the easiest piece i could remember. i think i first played it when i was 8 years old and i played it better then.
good. now you can go for a reason.
yeah.
that's the call that i'm waiting for.
have you talked to mallory about this?
well, why not? the captain on a ship can. it doesn't seem fair that... hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
you shouldn't think about things like that.  it'll just make you crazy.
is he like that in real life?  so gorgeous?
david's looking for me... i have to go.
mookie.
yes, but only in the dream they call life.
they do it to honor the dead, ellen.
what's the problem?
okay.
i don't know.  i'm so scared. help me.
yeah, it would suck big time. i'd kill myself first.
quiet, will you? this is ser- ious. our lives are in danger.
it's all in your own mind, father... it's you who imagine that i'm always up here with some man or other....
who?
everything that's happened since tom grunemann disappeared. the phone calls and the --
but why? there must be some way to make her understand!
getting off on the inaugural?  gonna go...
they told me, you might try to talk me into something... you need to rest mr. parker... it's for your own good.  i've been following your story for a long while.  it's a beautiful thing you did.

i don't think you understand how i really feel about you, seymour.
our decision. together.
can i give you a hand, beautiful?
easy, bill.
ours is not to reason why.
really?
the guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form hauser...all of that was set up by us.
i still remember caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
i've tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.
yeah?
you sound like a man with a couple of kids.
christ, michael - what the hell are we doing...?  we don't even know -
what?
oh!
the first time can be awkward. you just have to get on and try again.
you know, linda. i've finally figured it out. it's not sex i want. anyone can have sex.
he doesn't see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.
well... okay. i would like you to help me find a...wife.
how about bari?

i should say something in this about magic.
what does she say?  the woman.
what kind of a girl are you, anyway?
chelsea 2-7099.  we scared him once. maybe we can scare him again.  i'm using that word "we" a little too freely, i guess. i don't take any of the chances.
i'm almost afraid to. what did you bring me, contraband klingon --
a hundred rubles st. petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.

what case?
here.
vicki?... this is batman. i thought i'd call and see how you're doing.
who's ted bundy?
no!
you be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
oh! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! what have you got for me? is it finished?
how do you know?
this story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. it's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
those are gifts.
you'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
what did that cost?
no. they don't.
hello miss.
that's good.
why doesn't it never work out?
ah.  would you mind if i borrowed your computer console?
i worry for you.
just a little joke, miss farmer.
he... he just does.
who are you calling?
no, no, it's not. it's better.
what tied the room together, dude?
i do.
i don't know.  i thought, maybe i'd move in with my parents for a while.
time will tell.
i know i don't want to stay in here.
now look what you've done to him.
..the next day i managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, i checked our aliases.
ho-yah. him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun, above great river, near eagle rock.

war's over, pal. 
"american president"
back off, just go away you klutz. alright, here's the story. the items in these cases belong to me. i designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
this is joe namath's old number, you know. you could get a lot of chicks with this. just don't pee in it.
use caution.
now where were we?
is that right?
i used it to start the fire --
but <u>we</u> let him out.
i'd never be able to live with mysel--
that's fine! that's fine!  now fall right into their laps. go ahead. say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off. you know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
we've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
why should i go?
it'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  the gardener will know what to do.
just don't tell me you "owe me one."  what file?
kaboom.
i can't take her with me.
you lied to me.
as if your mind's not all there.
yes.
okay, we'll come back to that.  so, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  it's longdale, looking for a snuff film. and you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. why here?
how you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... i don't know if she'll be there alone... she'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
what did he have to do -— look at the body?
we were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
why?
yes.
poor larry. obedient as ever.
if you were an artist you could have created something!
well...
that's it.
the truth can kill, my friend. five hundred men died out there. this isn't a story they'd ever want out. when paul's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing. i knew they meant business.
not in those words.
this is li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  it's too fine a gift. i cannot accept it.
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl i've ever known and --
morelli -  you knew julia.  was she gypping wynant?
no one thought they'd hold out so long.
well--what have we here?  a family.
you know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
your little jack-in-the-box gun. that might be useful.
news-flash, tanner. i'm a fucking rat.
okay.  top five side one track ones. number one... "janie jones," the clash, from the clash.
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
-- let's check that interpol window again --
my cousin is the harbor master. you must not bring in drugs.  you cannot be armed.  if you're carrying, it has to go.  or stow it inside.  no one will go near your boat...
let me shift gears here a minute...  do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
y'all have a seat. is this all of you?
no --
oh, harold! what a fuss this is.  so unnecessary.
go to bed with a man and lie to him? she's a woman.  she's got all the training she needs.
oh my god, mother!
-- now here's the way it's going to work..wallis, the shares outstanding are..
four.
where's kelly?
i really don't know her that well. we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house, but that was about it.
i found her in bed with someone.
nick, what are you talking about?
listen, i'm going to make sure steph and siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
it's a bi-partisan issue. everyone needs to swallow hard. no one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
what did you think?
annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
the 'death star' has become operational.  there is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
how ya doin', man?
don't be fooled, madeleine! he fears for himself. he's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
david. please.
no, no, i'm sorry. i didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside greenland.
why too late?
you saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
you wouldn't announce it?
either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. here all eyes gaze on us.
i don't know, i can't say --
it has to be the cloud.  it's fundamentally altered our dna.
'scuse me?
that's it. you're that policeman with friends in low places. tell me, how's guissepe torres doing these days? those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
bye, sugar.  we been playing with the wrong bands.
depends on what you call love. i grew up on a reservation. a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. that's where they stick indians, bobby. that's where they leave us to die. my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. there's no hope there... jake was my ticket out. mom and me.
then tell me what happened.
"hi. i'm mr. edgar!"  look, mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
hi mom!
how about it?
i'll settle for a pardon. you gotta drill?
himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. he's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
then why did you call the police in the first place mother, huh?
you know charlie how-come?
that's okay, kid...
if i can get to the chopper, i'll meet you at the rendezvous.  don't wait for me.
mookie, you must think i'm stupid or something.  you're gonna run outta here and i won't see your black ass for another week.
fast work. you just moved here.
uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
we been through that.
it's on the table where i left it! what the hell are you doing?! hurry up!
not actually .... our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
yeah, i know, that's why i took up the drums. it's me active compensatory factor.
bill, lou, we're standing in the heart of the united states government's intelligence community in new orleans.  that's the fbi there, the cia, secret service, oni.  doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time?
isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
but...what kind of a shooting war?  have they hit any of our cities yet?
here is the six month's increase in advance.  you needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  see me again in another six months. but of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
but nothing... i'm mad as hell. this is a terrible thing you've done.
... if it happens, it happens. if it doesn't, it doesn't. do you understand what i'm saying? you never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. that's what we call a paradox. are you following me?
oh, i don't have no plans. no plans at all.
that's my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito. i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland.
it's mine.  talley.
okay, folks, i think we know how this is going to go...
to doctor marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i.

i'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
i don't know what happened... and i don't know what you did...
no. not really.
a fender strat. you bought this?
don't be silly.
oh. yeah.  it was all worked out before, you know. she and dad had taken care of it.
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore - or starting to. tell me the rest now.
you never needed nobody. always made that clear to me.
a bird of prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
captain... this probe may be a key a key to the aliens.
if you've got "a broad" available i'll take her.
screw you, asswipe!
you've got to talk about it. what about me? you said they stole that plane to bring you here. i didn't want to come. you owe me some responsibility.
uh, uh, this is great.  i mean, i love e.e. cummings, but i can't let you get this.
okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
i didn't follow you!
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. they'll believe me.  i've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
oh.  well, i live--
mr. mintz.
i was beautiful then.
what are you doing here?
you're right: of course, you're right. it's just that i've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  our perspectives are different.
i heard cy coates was brought in. he looked pretty bad.
does it please you to say such things?
they're ready now.
no.  why only --  oh --
escape.
so whose car is it?
longer we hang around down here, jack, better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
do you think you'll find her?
not like this.  we were never like this.  i want to go over there.  after dinner, we can--
hello bill.
steppin' razor a warrior. but this man...  ...this man stone crazy. surely, the mute is a false prophet. our paths uncertain.
why?
you sold the car. you got a job. what's the third thing? tell me.
uhuh, uhuh, what's i tell ya? that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
good evening, sir.
...did you ever use the alias clay bertrand?
what about the gun?
everything sounds fine, bomb. dropping you off in sixty seconds. good luck.
get it out of here!
well, gallagher! glad to see you.
but edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
they're townies?!
okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
tell me, 007, what do you know about elliot harmsway?
to begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
shouldn't we be moving on?
dead and gone.
what the hell is the tampon test?
this old guy -- he's the kind of person i expected to meet when i moved out here.  someone who's done things with his life.
c'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
actually, we just wanna watch tv...
what?!
hi,
mr. appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress. believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
yes.
probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
ju-just stay away from her. it's none of your business, okay? there are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
no.  it stops now.  it stops here.
when i walked out, i waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  ten. waiting for you to come find me.
i would have said it was impossible, but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
okay, so i don't like it any more than you do.  i'm just saying
what makes you say that?
and you didn't see anything at all?
because you'd laugh.
well... what the fuck, man?
i'm sorry to disturb you, mr. gardiner, i know you must be very busy.
they loved you.  i told you they would love you and they did.
it's only for the license. there's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
i'm putting liquor in the drinks, i'm giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's gonna offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!

if you're going to openly be a bitch....
i think it's okay, king.  they should go off on impact.
no more man. i'm about to drop as it is.
you lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
where do we go -- my place or yours?
what makes you an excellent lawyer?
that's not news, zoe.

i think so.
your expenses are your own.

what are you doing, ted?
died...
what was he doing?
how long with paula?
thank you.  so, since i have a few more days of vacation left, i was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  i mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
no... but i found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
we have to go after them, find where -- !
give me their uniforms. i will put people at the gate, in disguise.
well, there it is. jesus!
master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
restraining order?  where the hell you meet this girl?
you're doing great with her.
tomorrow afternoon.  don't worry. i'll be ready.
then come with me.
fuck you.
mr. wood?!
all right then, i suppose i owe the family that much.  you'll have everything ready for me when i arrive?
you'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra. he played rachmaninov's vocalize opus 34. no. 14. it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard. i actually forgot where i was for a time.  you seem surprised?
did you read them?
where do you think we came from?
you call this... glory...?  all this... this blood... this smell of...
guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. if that's true, then there must be some connection with the amargosa star.
that's not my handwriting.
she's being called for.
...to big.  the in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
madame bougival; mademoiselle clairwil -- and of course -- the marquis' wife --
i said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  i've exorcised forces from this house. eliza knew, she was there.  it wants another soul, the one we've taken away. we must weaken it!
but those are our dreams, son. we have to make them come true.
who's in it?
go back to the bus and reroute the call.
maybe i'm not a good man. maybe inside i'm bad, and i'll always be bad.
nay, dearest jack... you are to be my husband.  i want none other.
there ain't no possums in this woods tonight, daddy.
...it had no choice. the defensive grid was smashed. we'd taken the mainframes... we'd won.  taking out connor then would make no difference.  skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  we captured the lab complex.  found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. the terminator had already gone through.  they sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. sumner didn't make it.
what cat  ?
where's ronnie?
what are you doing, plank?
it is the work of untouchables.
well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
what in god's name are you talking about, woman?  when are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
they can't touch us at this height.
yeah.  honey, if you're watching this is for you.
doctor.  ph.d.
incredible!  five for five.  you're not cheating on me here, are you?
what's the catch?
what?
obviously...
he said it made sense that gary's code was like teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. said it was all about his own guilt.  plus, he has a tendency to get gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. it always passes.
jack! i didn't like that.
mac, did you ever find out who molly went off with?
where is she?
yeah, right. the inspiration. it's a true story anyway, so i don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
last time might as well've been the first.  i remember all the times, don't i.  watching her grow up --  in increments.
shit, i forgot to call her back.  she's off on a trip somewhere.  oh god, my grandad's flat in london's been sold.
susan wants to come.  she says she's in love with me.
what's the limit?
you ready?
i don't have time... i need to know.
what about him?
it's all right.
it's my daughter! go after her.
it's important!
what?
what's on the other end of this thing?
what do you want?
do you believe this shit?
jesus! you must think i'm dumb. what are you bugging me for? i know what to do!
not talk!  i said talk!!
is not so hard to understand. her playing, very polite.
a look in his eyes! hold your hats, brother, here we go again. you think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. look at him. the bum! and the crush you had on that little abyssinian... .
i tried...
no!  it would be something better! something <u>impressive</u>.  the biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
you figured this was a set-up? and you showed up anyway?
"materiel"? what do you mean by that?
look at that.
you miss the pain?
that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and i'm beginning to see why.
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
what are you doing?
you mean kayo nolan, the old timer? he doesn't know much.
where are you going ?
oh, i was just writing you a note. what do you say we take a walk?
well, if you must know -- i fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. ain't that a kick in the head?
...why did she do it, ruth? why?
i'm going to kill myself.
ah-ha. favouritism. but i so want mozart.
dead, rose is dead? you mean... she died?
because there's a man i want to see.
oh, tracy... i have to tell you, i'm not the one to talk to about this.
i don't know.
well, he who finds the grail must face the final challenge.
hanover, listen...
no.  i have one more thing to do.
i'm at space station five, darling. how are you?
futterman!...he's got a little tradin' post on the south fork o' the brazos...laurie, i just got to get me a good horse! think yer pa would...
that's a sharp jacket.
dunbar says you were.
susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
faster than cricket?
don't get mad, louise, but where are we going?
just machinery.
you're too modest, nixon.  you're as evil as i am.  we're both from poor families.  but others pay to feed the hunger in us.  in my case, millions of reactionaries.  in your case, millions of vietnamese.
grrrhmmnnnjkjmmmnn!
hey ! what are you doing here ?
damn him!  i should have killed him on the front -- i let you talk me out of that.
i need some information.  thought you might be able to help.
you're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
no, you're stupid.  get going!  right now!  she's primed!
good.  'cause i...um...i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel.
you told me.  i've got to run, jeff.
and hollis knew about it?
what do you want me to do?
next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
the workhouse.
paul, how the hell are ya'?
he's alive!
no!  don't kill him!  pendergast, you were right.  it's john!
well, personally, i never went for church names.
throw the second switch!
here's the list of all sheldon's credit charges. nothing after the silver creek.  any calls?
isn't there something you can give him?  a pill or something?
who is it?
you'll take fifty and like it!
oh, this is terrible... please go on.
i can describe it.
longer.
honestly, the suites are all about the same.
what look?
then where the hell is he?
we should get back --  what?
uh-huh.
hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
didn't happen yesterday, i'll tell you that. torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
there are thirty five listed in the reverend wong's roster...
you have an interesting accent. where are you from?
why not?
you heard me. you already put a fucking nick in my piano.
waal, <u>there</u> you are, and have i got some news for <u>you</u>...
today is tuesday. what?
pull me in!
i'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
you know, eat healthier.
eight o'clock. shit. you'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
sit down and join us, cindy.
'couldn't convince teddy to come?
you know something?  i actually never think of that.  i gotta get some coffee.
i'll do everything in my power --
yeah, it's her job.
but.
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
this.
what were you talking about the other day?
you've got some on your face.
you're gorgeous, god damn it! from the moment i first saw you i knew i had to have you.  i had to have you!
then i'd say you're a lucky fellow.
no, no.
and mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  it makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
i'm interested in who handled it.
where did you meet him?
do you believe in it?
... okay, then, i have a confession to make.  i'm the batman.
you got the 400 grand yet?
thank god for you, faith.  i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  you don't know what a service you're performing for simone -- shielding her from those animals.
we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake.
stay out of it.
the telephone is ringing.
at least i'll have company when i die.  ain't that right, jake?
you tell maggie.
now what are we doing? i don't get any of this shit!
here's what i don't get.  for nine months, death does all this shit to make sure i win these tickets and end up on route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
is there objection?  you may proceed, senator.
why, i ain't hardly touchin' you!
okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  we don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
do you love me?
if i told you once...i told you a thousand times...
i am not living with him.  i've just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i'm doing. look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  you know that, don't you?  i left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  and i suddenly realized that i like my job, and i like what my life is could be turning into, and that i'm getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, i sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run.  probably nothing.
if she's not now, terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
...do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
you didn't have a gun before, did you?
why are you doing this?
i could kill that no good son of a bitch!
october 15th, direct flight, london heathrow to rio de janeiro, british airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. seven six five.
do you think i haven't noticed ... do you think i wasn't aware of the drift? oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
when did you have it last?
no, fuck you. this rope is bullshit. i'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. must weigh 30 pounds.
must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  it was always messing up.
what?
here's your carrots. you're in such a hurry. you can't wait.
"ingen."  what's ingen?
i guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
but it was a whole lot of killing. why should we miss that?
no, i ain't got you...
aha! -- the baron. what do you want here?
ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. like girl. you there?
you asshole!  i can't believe what a --!
lilly's up.
move out? i don't understand, thomas.
do you want me to pet your head?
i've been in here before.
you know everyone can be controlled pavel. where are you storing the personnel files?
honest, mr, charles.  i never touched that safe.  them bonds that were missing... julia took them.
what's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. and i'll be seeing her again soon. only what will i say? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? that he's down here laughing?
i see. tell me, harold, do you remember your father at all?
shit!  a nursemaid!  my first detail, and i'm a fuckin' slug!  i got a 'choice' at all.
if you're interested in what people say, signor matisti, i may be able to enlighten you a bit.  the newspapers, for instance.  i'm an authority on what the papers will say, signor matisti, because i own eight of them between here and san francisco...  it's all right, dear. signor matisti is going to listen to reason.  aren't you, maestro? 
um, because you didn't want to go.
the... interviews are about sex, ann.
yesterday. it all looked normal.
what time does the bus leave?
i don't want anything to happen to you.  i care about you.
is the hatchet buried between the english and my french father?
it's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
vincent...vincent...
which view?
he died...  ... in 1972.
it was beth's idea.
don't go there...
the c.i. what?  god, no...
he served on the goliath.
no more, robert... no more needles...
all right.  well, sure nice to meet you.
can you put men at all four?
let me guess... bullets don't hurt you.
this? this is a joke.  i'll give your group a thousand bucks.
well, this land is about to be condemned.
sorry, i wouldn't have made a joke if --
i passed out.
oh god...
i really thought he would show up. i waited... and waited... and waited...
i'm leaving in the morning.
sure.
it was.  it is.  but this is a different kind of show.
the group is more than a theatre company. it's the embodiment of an ideal. our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. you see --
yeah, i guess that's tragedy right there.
"what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  and that's it." and we sit there.  i got the pen out...
the university cannot do this. is the room safe?
this could be it!
ok toots, i will.
industrial refuse.
of course you didn't.  you didn't know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
what's the use! hooee! it'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
some of you i know, some of you i'm meeting for the first time.
killing his son was <u>stupid</u>! it made kirk willing to die.
get this, man. i was at the game today. face to fucking face with strawberry! jesus! i saw him strikeout. and you know what? he looked at me, and i looked at him, and he laughed and i laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the big one. tomorrow. today i understood for the very first time that --
terrific, boys.  really.  terrific.
certainly, general.  why do you ask, sir?
i miss you too.
but i'm not that late. you didn't have to give away my seat.
he's still alive, edna!
this is not right.
the novel.  no, skye davidson is playing the lead.
well, wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
it's a sat-tracker.
yes.
frederick didn't come with her.
there's no happier thought under heaven.
thank you, uncle.
i can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
i believe her, too. i don't think she's having an affair with enrique.
yeah?
i'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. let me tell you something else, vic-baby: wrong is wrong.
what's that?
you're talking like a crazy person,
you understand perfectly.
hey, debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
it's the only way. you know that. we'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
are you sure?
promise me you'll come back.
yes.
as opposed to?
i tried to be late, john- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
calm down, what, what is it?
i guess.
no.
what d'you want?
i can't believe you. dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
what about the mainframe's access code?
- in the gods - huh?
and i intend to be there when she's ready.
tell me what it was that gave me away. what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air.
she's done it.
you be our guest, jack.
betrothed?  i think not.
you're up!  you must be feeling better --
i just stopped your heart for five seconds. it felt like an eternity, didn't it? did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
she's had a lot to deal with...she needs time....
i love that belt.  what are you, about a fifty big and tall?
i will have to face the consequences, but so will you. don't forget they will ask how you got them.
you know who that is, don't you?  you really don't? that's skip skipperton, man. he gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
fun-ny. see you.
oh, very well. i'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. i should be used to it by now.
good.
well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
they don't?  then why do they still write me fan letters every day. why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  because they want to see me, me, me!  norma desmond.
let her go, cin.
i'll take everything at face value. i'll be a good listener to you.
goodbye, dr. thurman.
your mess.
are you coming...?
she's been bitten.
as i said, i haven't decided what to do, exactly. perhaps i won't do anything.
so. i got a question. just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. we call the coastguard.  coastguard shows up. what exactly is the plan?
a police captain.  i think he's behind all of this.
why two?
that's how it is, chum. one column - and i can bring all this tumbling down. i can take you off the streets for good.
what do you know about the highlands?
george, c'mon -- lighten up.  it's a beauty of a case.  don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. he ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
you wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after i get out of here?
naw.
we may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
but that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
i got married last night.
do you think frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
cops.
i'm hungry.
i seem to have dropped my key.  oh -- here it is.
banished... yeah.
good evening, odette, who is sick this time?
i'm not telling.
that's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
he told me to play blue-face with buzz. i like games.
my god!
hardly. i couldn't be less alone.
no.  you don't do anything.  i do it.
ex...ex, ex...
oh baby... oh baby...
maybe i'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. in south africa the numbers were small...
how long have you been back?
just trying to make it look real.
no!!
yeah!  here's a name.  this is somebody's personal tax --
who killed your patient?
thanks, charles.
we're always in here.  she really gets him, doesn't she?
i see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a james bond film, is it?
yeah?  outta what?
there've been some complications, sir. the chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
should protect you a little, from the compression.  if that thing gets ahold of you.
i have to make love to her. it's very simple. she has no choice really.
...i don't know what i do feel like.
i think i just got my period.
incredible.  the cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  it's a remarkable duplication.
glands.  you're supposed to be happy when you die.  call me comical again.
imagine--she was alive. what a horror. could have been buried alive. she must have run away from the morgue.
believes it!  jesus, it's driving him crazy.  he wants to kill him.  i don't know, corky, i don't know what he is going to do.  i'm getting nervous, really nervous.
i...i don't know.
easy, your worship.  only trying to help.
yeah, you did that too.  you earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all i'm saying.
i have nothin' to say.  if you wanna contact my attorney...
hold it, sefton. so we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
you monsters!
nothing more than a bother.  have you any news for me?
already did. he's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
one hunnert's the best we can do here.
einstein flunked out of school... twice.
maybe if you're on the coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
we learn from life.
why?
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard -- i wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
-- i don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
you -- sent them away. without even letting me say goodbye?
me?
yeah, bazza, what?
oh.  you look so beautiful.
i don't know. i packed up my shit and ran away. to this... so unlike you, i guess i do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
we'd gone to 'code blue,' we were administering electro...
now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. don't break it.
huh-huh. you?
good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
just tell me if anything weird happens.
i don't think so.
sure, i guess.
i want you to take a look at this girl here. she's been in some porn stuff.
tim!  lex!
well hi vanessa! what brings you to the mall today?
that's difficult to say, general.
rose, rose, rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know i love you? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? you are beautiful to me, rose, i've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. and don't you know mrs. hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
yes?
read it back.
why certainly, baby.
you know, i saw you guys once. you and frank.  at the roosevelt.
like you're better!
not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
travis, what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most?
this house was built in 1898 by a man named archibald keaton as a gift to his wife, cora.
i hope you make your peace with jabba.
yeah i guess...sort of.
for fuck's sake, abbe! what am i to do? police my readers as you police me? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? would you condemn the bible? i think not!
bullshit.  bullshit. you know the answer to every goddamn question and i knew the answer to those questions and i'm not half as smart as you are so what happened?
you need anything else?
what'd you say, captain?
i don't feel too good.  i think i'm still drunk from last night.
you know what that is, right?
hey, what the hell you doing?
but we civilized it. a place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
ha! is the pope catholic?
i'm a robber.
hey. fuck you.
it stands so still.
depends.
what, the heat here?
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  but then you make friends so easily.  don't you, grace?
i knew.
i looked it up.
what'd you say to me!
he was afraid of himself.  he tried suicide once.  he was ill.  manic depressive.  he had wild emotional highs and lows.  not a happy affliction for a scientist.  he'd been revered in our community.  by the end he was a joke.
lasher will act, rowan.  whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  i don't like -
i feel the need, the need for speed. i'm driving out of myself.
twenty. i'll be twenty-one next week.
i've been sittin' in the church.
roy, i know what to do with myself! it's a big world out there.
you gave me a 'd'.
i think you'll enjoy this table.
hear about ice?
no.
may i ask why?
you're gonna love it.
something happened to you.
what do you mean?
this should have bled by the pint. yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. how... ?  whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
not now, charlie. i've got a headache. get used to the word. roll it around your tongue for a years.
i could've saved them.
how'd you get into the shipbuilding business, gavin?
how you doing, ms. jackie?
oh.  okay then... lloyd dobler, 555-1342.
you see, it s like i say. you always have an answer for everything.
hold on --
did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
martin, uh, we've found it.
saunders, i've lit cigarettes -
yeah i'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. i've decided to make you a special project of mine. you ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
oh, no. i would never think it! it's so beautiful. you are so... i'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
can we talk?  just for a minute?
hey there, dan'l! black dan'l!
when he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. he will freely give the names of his superiors.  then we get them and they too will give us names.  and eventually somebody will get us to juan obregon and the cartel will fall.
we're not actually talking about it.
professor tripp.
what is it, doctor? what's happening?
it's on.
what? oh! i see! it's st. phillips. oh, of course. why... why that's very good, i mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
ok. that's wrong.
she's here.
you sabotaged the bus! you kept us here... to die! first keith, then carl --
i guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
oh, i don't know. either i'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
poor cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
i do not understand the final question...
i didn't mean it to sound like that.
so what are you thinking for college?
oh, nothing much. just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. if you don't want me to run it --
'bye, mama...
what do i love?  i love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths.
what do we do?
lovely.
um... liz -- i -- there's something i'd like you to -- something i need you to hear.
slow down, man. they ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
don't try to cheer me up that way.
i have been... afraid. afraid... they will hate me... because i am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
maybe she has.

claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
dad, i don't know about this one --
i wonder if that was the same copter.
ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
why the beach?
wow, that really is great. in a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
hi, alyssa.
i mean yes, i help people that need it...
fine, charlie.  you familiar with the marsh case?
what?
let's admit we struck out this month. the gulf stream's standing by. the basic lab stuff is on it.  you, zeller, jimmie price, a photographer. anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. we get the call, we roll. the scene'll be very fresh...
they buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. then something happened. half the tribe died in a season. the rest moved on. they said a wendigo had soured the ground.

then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
he's going to take his foot off slowly, david. then you're to go home, like a good boy. you hear me?

jabez -- help!

he can't abide a woman in trousers. he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
but there's one thing. the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. i mean -- i don't know what their policy is -- but --
no, but...
hi.
tom, where are you going --
that's ironic.  because we're here to protect her from you.
what do you mean, walked?
if this is a joke, it's not funny.
no, trust me, you want to take this call.
frank.
i thought i'd take some now.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  he looked like such a dope.
keys.
is tong older than ming?
what about all these letters?
where's the other guy?  buzz.
stop! --
when he finds out you tossed his list? i would.
it's not that.
jacques?  i'm pregnant.
you think i'd really drink that?
bastard.
that's my point! you see man...burning at his absolute. to see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. that's what i'm driving at. you get me?
very clever.
i'd like to place a 'personals' ad in the free press.
i know...i know. you did the right thing.
cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
it would be great if i'm crazy.  if i'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  i'll never have to live underground.
thank simone for the tickets.
no. you're just crazy about "liebestraum."
uh... uh...  umm... long time.
one shirt - blue, collar attached.
i'd be too scared to ask him for it.
crystal lake...where the nightmare began.
no, wait.  i can be dumb.  really. or mean, or whatever.  i can learn. i'm useful.
i mean real money -- not counterfeit!
i ain't no more a preacher, you know.
if i leave, you will be right back where i found you...
we did no impact evaluation.  the consequences of...
no. 
mike, good to see you.  got everything you want?
i don't need his life story. is he really that dangerous?
this isn't friendship.
you was right to change your mind, kid.
jackie shawn.
it's worse. i think there's something going on between cecile and her music teacher.
quite a shithole, isn't it?
oh yeah, the insurance guy.
run, tommy!!!  run!!!
marg!
i...i don't know.
i was there.
central park.
okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? what the hell is going on?  you got no discipline in your operation.
peter, you've got to promise me something. promise you'll never lie the way charles did. why do people have to tell lies?
this is --
cool. see you later.
i promise.  we'll talk.  you'll be great.  you'll be fine.  go ahead, just imagine that, uh... just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
well... i'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
come on, now, i don't want to see you unhappy.
are you sure somebody was back there?
oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
that wasn't the answer i was hoping for.
which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
what do you see...?
well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
of what?
danger?
i think i've lost my mind. i think you're not real. i think i'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
my neck, dog.  that's the last bag?
yes.
it must have stopped moving.  i'm not getting anything.
that's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
...that’s our war room. we did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
you really like that shirt?
i like guys if that's what you're asking.  not that i trust'm.
you scum!  you sick filth!... you did that to her!
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
what would you do up here?
on the contrary, i've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. and that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the united states army.
and how many soldiers do you have?
i thought i was foolish. i thought i'd mistaken infatuation for love. you said:
jesus, steven, that's...that's really lovely.
the camerawork's nice.
have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
... i cannot confirm the existence of praxis.
the official inquiry blamed weir's design for the ship's loss.
sorry.
you are not so sure that he'll come.
well, i appreciate your concern, but i'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
how does mrs. eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
oh dear.  i <u>have</u> made you nervous.
back-up.
and they won't be able to tell?
i'm really sorry about that, man.
it's like farming. i am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and george clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and i assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. and the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
my husband is a good man.
this place is built like a fortress.
what a pleasure, governor reynolds.  i'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-b...
pretty much what you'd expect.
where's lieutenant barcalow ?
did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  it'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies.
what?
about what?
yes?
the infamous dog?
that is amazing. what year is it?
kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
you'll like it here.
bon soir, mademoiselle!
moreover...
hey, hot stuff. you're still on the clock...
ow!
you stole a trans-am.
he's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
how do you do. would you care to finish the game? i have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
you'll *what*?... come on, pa. come on an' whup me. jus' try it.
why did you do that, billy?
ask her.
but you're thieves. it's what you are.
i will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; i'm strictly on the up and up, so everyone beware. if anyone's caught taking graft and i don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
see what i mean about it getting spooky?
otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, i'll dip my beak just a little.  just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
look! there it is!
he says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  and he means it.  ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
there isn't time.
yessir.
that's 'cause i <u>wasn't</u> there.
all right. you can't. but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd street that your brother-in-law runs. and we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
what happened?
okay, mr. detective, who did it?
jeanne, calm down.  you can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
you wouldn't dare.
jesus... you're leaving.
i'm... a friend of his. his best friend. see, his father...
wanna go?
i didn't look like a bum.
tear it apart?
oh, thank you, darling.
what about your film? isn't it due next week? have you even started it?
then if i wasn't born, who am i?
we know him.  he's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
i don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
you are really going to force this, aren't you?
'knows i'm altering the coordinates. let's jump to #12.
wait.
don't tell me i'm not a fucking asshole when i know i'm a fucking asshole!
excuse me, are you alright?  i noticed you talking to yourself.  i'm a nurse.  can i be of some help?
yeah.  it wasn't like my marriage to roger was so great, even before --  jerry?
i'll be frank with you.  this was his mother's idea.  a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
that we're going back.  i don't want it to end.  i don't want to be what i was when i left.
...jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? for christ's sake, you were seven years old! you think he could have heard you in there?
what's the matter, george?  something wrong?  you look like you just fucked your mother.
i didn't mean to bite him, i really didn't.
come on, we beat an instructor. how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
you seem to know a lot about him.
i am?
i'm going to lynn bracken's.  i'll meet you at the dining car.
like a sickness and its cure together.
oh.
mr. charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. listen, mr. charles --  i did do a little chiseling.  i come to bring it back and fix up the books.  i didn't want him to find out and come after me -

well, she probably had a deadline...
fine! don't put yourself out. i'll go to the land of death alone.
dude, i'm not supposed to make calls--
maxie! hey maxie wha'd'ya say!
so what's the point?
it hasn't adjusted.
i've lost my napkin.  it was all elf-work and lace... i must have dropped it when you startled me so.
because i have something very important to do.
four-twenty-eight.
but you, you've had them.
if she says anything to them i'll kill her.
what's the matter, baby. don't you like me anymore?
code. if you work with gordon you learn that right away.
i'm glad you're here because i have something i want you to do. i want you to call up ben tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
-build the bridge over the tsavo river. and be finished in four months time. can you do that?
stop it. you are blowing a great opportunity here, miles. fucking maya, man. she's great. she's cool. she's funny. she knows wine. what is this morose come-down bullshit? these girls want to party. and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, vouvrays? i mean, come on!
i don't know.
i can’t believe this...  what’s coming now, eh? if i don’t pay all hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
it's true.
then i'll call the mainland for a charter.
all i know is, ever since "glen or glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
they keep sayin' two homosexuals. i'm not a homosexual.  i want you to stop them saying that.

i-i can do the job, sir.
i don't know what came over me.
she's downstairs with ruth. get ready.
so, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
well, we got some of taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
and cooperate? you might get probation.
she comes along too.
'cause you don't lose loads?
there's only one thing we can do. we've got to get rid of it. we've got to get an abortion.
i mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  and you're going through them quick.
i hope so, sir. golly i never knew it could be so exciting.
you'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
i can handle it. he's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  the queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- like that.
drew told me.

what do they look like?
forget the money. you've got to get these people out of here. this is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
do you expect me to believe that?
not really.  i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  that's what all our friends think, anyway.
since the school is closing anyway, i'm going to write that novel i've been threatening on everybody.
this isn't just a story!!  it's history made allegory.  it is a philosophical handbook for life!  it holds the secret of this very voyage.
i hear you talk when i'm waiting!!!
she's all right, andy. it's just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks, and i was expecting something better, that's all.

case?  so far i haven't seen a damn thing.
i need you to do two things for me. one, watch danny witwer.
where?
mary -- look! hessian gold. i found it in the barn.
the eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  not a very real expectation.
yeah.
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
this is all a mistake! don't you understand?!
how can anyone say that? we have no cook, no maid. we have no footman. nothing at all!
oh, something. . romantic?
i can do it myself.
what...happened?
go away, assface.
your friends are probably still on the line.  pick it up and say hello.
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom?
what does it look like?
yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
what i'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
ten points for our fearless leader ... sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the bill bixby trifecta -- ?
colonel vitelli.  we got a busted-in cold vault inside.

that's a good question. what's the last thing you remember?
sorry 'bout that.  so queens, you psyched for the series?
look, i haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

i don't know.
i'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.

we could pass for that.
c'mon, tommy --
well. i hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. pitching right in. lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. you're smart. in fact, *i* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
oh no you can't. get on with the painting.

no, i can't. i've already convinced both mom and dad to come.
i'm not hanging. i'm fixing my car --
how about your wife and son?  how do you think they'll take to it?
weir can't be alive.
i'm sorry, but i need your help. you contain information.  i need to know how to get it.  can you just tell me who leo crow is?  can you tell me if --
short shift?

you'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
you suck at lying, archie.
they don't know this.
31 people.
it was my finger that pulled the trigger, but i'm not morally responsible.  my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of.  how could i know. i'm not a doctor.

not i —- i am alive, yet every hope i had is dead,  death can be good. death can be happy.. if i were really dying i could speak like cyrano -— "my courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. then perhaps you might understand,
wait... he wants to give her...?
who's doing this?
candy man.'  is that all right?
do you?
jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
we're warriors, not desk jockeys.  we've got to be bold.  you always want all your ducks lined up.  but nothing's 100 percent.  it's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. hell, i'd take 40-60.  then roll the dice.
pulse, slow, very little pressure.
goodbye mom.  i'll be okay.

a 4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for chrissake!
you talk kind of funny, but i like it.
just like this.
your birthday celebration, your majesty?
i told your wife.  trials aren't always so much about actual truth. as about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. that's sad.  and it's real.

life.  you've stopped living it.  you look, but you do not see.  you listen but, you do not hear.
what's still there?
let's see... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  and that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
why were the other two women killed?
and they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?

i can only speculate as to the reasons why.
miss mollie malloy. she's a wonderful person.

that is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
how did you get in here? and what do you want?
dead people.
really? you mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
guys like me, huh.  well, listen, even though i've been celibate lately, i'm not gonna force myself on you.  i've never done that in my life.
why do men chase women?
we just found another body.
jerry told me you were an expert with animals, mr. galbraith. couldn't you tell where it went?
someone's bringing in a kitten...?
they stole it.
yes.
sorry...
what'd you say?
how was your day?
up.  we're moving out.
what is it?
i figured you more as a socialist?
through ... we found them.
best equipped dentist in the whole goddam army. care to have a look, a man with your background?
what's this? what's this? god damn bullshit. bullshit. don't put those --
this is the end.
see? i'm psychic. not completely, but pretty much. that was pretty good, wasn't it?!
you're sorry!!
i can see that. you watch too damn much tv.
hurry!
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did?
i'm rachel. thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
that, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
take your money? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
it doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
i don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
yeah, but i don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
dj. the clark's gone. smith and cooper are dead.
worthingsly... worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
mmm.
why isn't he locked up?
i would have tried to show her a good time. i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did. stanley rosenfeld does not forget.
my god...
what are you <u>doing</u>? you just can't go.....besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
i think you better leave.
but --
you and me have nothing in common.
what she did not say was, 'i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' all she cared about was that look. all she remembered was that look. and why do we remember things in movies? because we can see them.
your unfaithfulness -- that's what i'm trying to talk about. your unfaithfulness. your betrayal. your dalliance. and you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
i'm sorry.  i'm so sorry to do this to you.
are you clean?
what are you talking about? you think i invited them?
go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
okay, now you gone and done it. you done messed with my business bitch!
what a place for them...
most of the creditors i know personally. i've seen them grow up in the community. i knew their fathers and mothers before them.
relatives of old man semple.
why not?
hey look at this!
miss kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as i'm concerned, you're tops. i mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  cheers.
like you said jack, i'm just a new york lawyer now.
how did you know?
but more or less.
thank you.
only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. now let's go!
uh-huh.
howdy, miz lampert.
look at that. eskimo. one word. i love it. i usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. eskimo. so mysterious...
i told you already: jennifer jenzen, executive v.p. of --
don't worry, george. nothing's going to happen. i'll fall right into line. i'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. i'll be the best little foreign secretary we ever had, just because i haven't the nerve to be anything else.
that's impossible, man!  okay, clark, out of the john where i can see you!
he's been like that for awhile. we need to get him some medicine.
give us things. not just some old flag like this, but –-
years.  this collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
i'm stayin', homer.
how nice.
she hated sleep.  she used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
she was?
i only eat popcorn at the movies.
yes, eve. that would be good.
you bet.
we are totally booked.
she was never attacked. i think she made it all up.
it's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  they diagnosed jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. he has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
when i found you?
that's it. that's why i don't come to the goddamn reunions! becaue i can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! you think i'm a failure! i know who i am. i'm proud of who i am. and all of you, you think i'm some kind of pity case! you with your sycophant students following you around. and you goddamn medal!
why do you think he does that, gerry?
i don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
you don't want the police any more than i do.
what are you doing?
you all right, mama?
what does that mean?
come on, gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
i'm telling you i don't care what time you think you're in. you're not william starks. [beat] i don't believe in many things, but i believe in death. and it doesn't give back what it takes. so whoever you are...i did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
last i heard, his mother was going alone.
you've been there?
i don't know how many times i have to say this, elaine, but viktor and i are not in love.  i only make love to the camera.
i thought we were talking about sidney?
after you -- mrs. peel ...
you're learning the hebrew really fast.
oh my god...
jack!  it's christmas!
does he have to go?
where can i meet this man?
this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so... so...
no. not this. this is real.  and he's right there... 
why didn't you tell me?
oh, come on-i mean, i was still younger.
go on. get in your tent. you don't know nothin'.
she used to tell me she'd turn me in.  little kid.  ten year old.  "if you're naughty, dad, i'll tell on ya."  she didn't want me sent down again, see. when i was planning some job.  "i'll tell 'em, dad, i promise i will.  here, look, i'm calling the old bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  i can see her, the phone in her hand.  became a sort of joke between us.  only it wasn't a joke.
ya like that, chief, huh?
unless they're in your summer school class!
...you are so goddamn weird.  oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
but i'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
is she?
we're stuck with this...
it was a racial incident.
i do *not* want a senator. and i do *not* want any more of this nonsense! emma!
well that is to be expected. my father...
what do we do now?
thanks just the same.
the habeus corpus is thickening.
i don't know, but under no circumstances would i talk about it here.  i want you to go home and relax the best you can.  continue your life as if nothing has happened. that is very important.
here. i've got every credit card ever printed. take this. stay here till you can arrange to get away. it's on me.
you're really good friends with the chancellor, aren't you?
i kissed him, kit.  on the mouth.
i fail to see how a little christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
don't look back! act naturally!
i never expected to see you again.
an actress.
tuesdays and thursdays.  but after play practice, i'm yours.
you're a deep one.
is it finished?
be quiet.
doctor lizardo. wasn't he on tv once?
because she loved him.  i know him, thea. believe me, he is not a cruel man.
they think i'm nuts.
i am so happy. no one can be so happy without being punished. i will be punished and i should be punished.  i want to confess, darling.
i can't. i'm involved now. if you let go i have to jump in after you.
like where?
what's there to do at the point? god, lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
well it just doesn't happen anymore mrs. macneil.
hmm?  oh, the knifes?  they're just props.  nice, aren't they?
the countess has come to our aid. the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. and i have been asked to oversee the ranch. for $300 a week. and as it turns out, the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, alice...
all right, commander, you wanna tell us anything?
u.s. pilots, this is air force one.
you don't "have to."
in that case, here are ten basic plays. i think that's about all this bunch can handle.
oh, i don't know. maybe i was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
good-bye.
the real nazis. hitler, goebbels, they talked about jews incessantly.... you ever read their diaries?...
look, i'm a lawyer and --
fort powell.  what do we tell 'em?
i believe in you, me, and rock and roll. and i'm not too sure about you lately.
so ... ?
that is a load of shit. personal power has nothing to do with any of this. tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...well that's just more than the man deserves.
didn't we play this scene before?
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone?
lotta rich women back there...
cute?
is it always like this?
what about them?
it's not <i>exactly</i> him.
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth.
you're really doing a great job here, josie. i like your "can do" attitude.
he gets it, but he's pissed.
i'm... i'm alright.
"a high court judge has confirmed that mr. gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor mr. khan resisted arrest." -- i told you about english law.
back to your bed!  at once!
no! fuck you! you start getting excited! we gotta fucking go!
i'm sorry ...
okay.
you said it wasn't a tragedy.
turn that back on!
then why do i feel like we're still being shadowed?
your phone's ringing, dude.
no, lemme finish.  i don't like this job!  that boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  and susan, like you said, she's growing up.  two heads. what i mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
you already have the tent?
well, okay. but we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. now the first thing i want is an exact copy of the john doe letter in your own handwriting.
at thy good heart's oppression.
let me tell you something cooper! i never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
of course i like children.
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? you know what code blue means?
he wasn't lying about marco:  he's thirty stories down on the street. the other man is heinrich, and i found his body upstairs.  and his bag is missing.
but would we get the phones back?
sorry. how'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
if i remembered you.  i came looking for you.  i would've said sure, let's do it.  but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team.  why would you trust me?
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to.influence your command structure. it was a bold plan.
where are you, what floor?
uh, helen, i wanted to talk to you a second about sean...
want me to drive?
i know i left them there.
maybe so.
well, it means another two weeks in paris.
puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
she was murdered?
i... i would take advantage of it.
i am?
i'm a loner, i'm not a monk.
do you have me?
i've read a great deal about your new york city.  do be a dear and tell me all about it.  sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
joe--i'm getting leery of this guy. we keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! i'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from sunday--
harry, you know everything.
i was attempting to get in the spirit of things. i thought it would be humorous.
i don't sell my work by the yard!
all right, what do you need.
i don't even know your name yet ...
i'm...in...the...room, here.  don't talk about me like i'm not in the room.
it is urgent, sir.
i'm really rooting for this one.
penguin? oh, cal! he is them.
upset!  what's he upset about?
fucking desert.
yes, sir.
slash what?
no.
sir, it only costs a nickel.
how does the distress signal look?
i can't bear it louis! the machines out there, that fly and that roar! and such lights! they make the night brighter than the day!
how is that wally doing?
gin and tonic.  plymouth or boodles.
fuck you.
is the plaintiff ready?
i wish i could stick it out like you.  i just, with trish and the kids...
tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. there's no saving it now.
what do you mean?
what could cause them?  what's in the core?
apparently, your sister died.
you remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
so, you just get here?
the car for debbie?
only the stupid ones.  cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  besides, i'm not ira no more.
there'll be another after me. and another after that. you'll find we're a resilient species.
max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
ours was one of the first. erasmus hall. i'm the president.
hey, sull.  my cable's out again.
who are you going to see?
so have i, actually... i wish it could always be like this.
yeah.
it's more like a date.
i like you, too, nathan.
he's really not a bad fellow.
wes, do me a favor.
that's pretty freudian, joe.
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolan's farm to see him.
i don't know.
what do you think?  any chance?  there's nothin' else i'm any good at, but this.
upstairs, with doc... yeah, it's very nice... i heard your shower.
you got a name, cop?
edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the sisters, and to keep you from things like i just seen out the window. my own daughter arm-in-arm with terry malloy. you know who terry malloy is?
what kind of guy do you think i am?
give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  what do we pay mookie for?  he don't even work.  i work harder than him and i'm your own son.
i do.
i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
i didn't make it...
are you a 5 or a 6? 
-- i guarantee she won't gain an once.  she's very disciplined.
it's another day.  i think i'm alright.
you will.  you'll get it.
it'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, inspector--
indeed.
and i think they just came back from masters and johnson.
all right. loneliness.  well -- separated. from other people. forgotten.  well, as if i can be here, i can go through the motions, right? but the truth is, i don't belong.
hell, man, that don't matter. we're loaded. we were big wheels in the black market in seoul.
come on, alvy, they're only baby ones, for god's sake.
there's so much, and so much of it is dull...
another rough night, huh?  that it?
no. this has been going on for some time . several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body. only parts.
i hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
love? love? what do you <u>know</u> about her? where does she come from? where did you meet her?
toby tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and i'm gonna have his love child.
i just don't know what i'm supposed to be. i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer... but i hate what i write, and i tried taking pictures, but john's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
get a grip. i didn't know.
yes.
you can check in on him tomorrow. between eight and five.
why don't you ride anymore? grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
maybe not...but maybe it does. if no one told me about this, i mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
you like chagall?
you're very naive, major.  don't they say they want disarmament?
on the nose.  i tell you what, because you’re so cute, i’ll take care of our incidentals.
you gotta help me. okay? this girl i told you about? diana? she's from the five towns. she's jewish. she won't go out with me alone. can you believe this shit? she's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. she's never been out with an italian before. she says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  you believe this shit? but you gotta see her. i mean, she's beautiful.
tomorrow. it has to be tomorrow. or forget the mask.
hey, he moved.
this other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
it happens.  this is where you'll be sleeping.
no, treves, it's out of the question. now if it was up to me, i'd say "certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," i'm sorry, i simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
c'mon, beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
yes.
you said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
back to the ship, huh?
i don't like what's happening.
its metal, god dammit its metal.
i don't understand.
cindy, what's going on?
fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
so that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
you don't find that repugnant?
why do you want to do that?
what is it?
names.
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice, relaying that information to you.
right o'.
do i?
i don't give a damn about his girl...
you don't need to know everthing, carla jean.
here you are.
yeah...
it's 2041...
*no*! i don't want to know him! he's doing *missionary* work--in *india*! i wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. maybe he got killed in the war!
we saw it in the office.  it went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
lizzy!
hey baby...
you really do hear a lot, don't you?
is, uh... is he okay?
they're all the same.
wait.
it doesn't seem right.
-- did i hear 'business'?
yeah. i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
ok.
i don't think i remember him.
will you have dinner with me?
i am him.
and, america?
are there any questions?  hudson?
i did not realize it was obligatory.
that wasn't me.
what?
that's my daughter.  or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  she's a drug addict.
what was that?
let me talk to you.
look at me...
i'm only human, you know.
you're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
i would cherish you--and stay sober.
yes.
oh my god! what's lonnie doing here?
he looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
it's my fault...i have to....
a little of this, a little of that. mostly i tell fortunes.
is the rest of the house as bad as this?
am i entertaining you?
yeah, i'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. there's nothing else.
what?
may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
pretty, isn't it?
what's he doing here?
ssssh.  brad's probably asleep by now. do you want him to see you like this?
only on the football field.
you mean to take us all down with you?
you see, i don't care if we are rich or poor -- i don't care if we're big or small, all i care about is jabez. he was the first man i loved. he never used to care about money -- we were poor as job's turkey, but none of us minded. now i've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. i've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. i've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. that's not like him, mr. webster -- it must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
i just realized something.  we've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
"it's why the witch kills children."
it is high time you got out of russia.
what's your worst memory of childhood?  quicker than that. i'm not interested in your worst invention.
i know.
fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
if this little show is for my benefit, i’ll take you home right now.
not from me. i only stole it. when are you coming over to the chamberlain's men?
shhh! do you hear something?
i can't lay that off in time.  we lose a bet that big, it could break us.
what kind of a dog is he?
what the --
daddy....
sorry. that was rude.
valentin zukovsky.
cry-baby?
well, honey, just grab some other toy!  now c'mon!
what did you say?
how are we gonna do this, nick?
i gotta pee.  can i ask you something? this town is called mumford... been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! right?  now here's the question -- your name is mumford, too.
uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
true, but neither is attempted murder. in fact i'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, earl?
...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  so full of..life!
incomplete, i might add.
about two-thirty.
what are you doing, ross? i've had that 15 years! ..
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late.
mr. gardiner, i have a telephone call for you. sidney courtney, the financial editor of the washington post.
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
that’s totally see through...
beyond what i told you, sir, it is classified information.
just terrible?  that's better than yesterday at least.
but you were such good <i>friends...</i>
hey val, listen.  bearing going out, you think?
what's going on terrance?
... that's perfectly all right.
i'll be all right.
by her own hand.  there are many such stories.
when i left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
but dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
some sort of lead or something.
don't be an idiot! i'm not the only one. if i die, serafine dies!
now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
yes commander?
like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
because...well, that's what he does.  he's a very powerful man.
what's wrong with him?
funny.  would you like to buy me a drink?
ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
ok...it's open.
but first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
no -- that's exercises. my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. that's the place where i sing.
if this bridge were in europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
as a color, not as rust. you know, a rust colored paint or wood?
i agree there should be more.
it you really loved me, steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
so, what makes you so popular? what's your secret?
did you do it?
we'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
it's sanskrit. it tells the story of sankara climbing mt. kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva.
this is just our cover.  we're dedicated to a higher purpose.
i've got good ears.
i say we make him pay first. after that you can do whatever you want to him.
you can't get away from me, albert.
as usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  except  it wasn't local democratic headquarters, it was national democratic headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
god, i don't know who's weirder, you or me.
i told you -- i quit.
please tell me i'm gonna get to see the jets win the super bowl.
je...sus christ!
dr. thompson, just so the jury knows, you never treated deborah ann kaye. is that correct?
bought at the airport.
do you wanna tour the clubs?
kinda tough on the butt.
you could help me try and figure it out!  i gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
should we get a what?
shit.  it's my galiano.
bully for you.
will you let me go then?
cora, is something wrong with the laser?
malcolm, this is essential work i'm doing.  just think what my research can do for education. elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
now i remember why i went into theoretical work.  kent.
no one. no one at all. i'm unemployed. who do you?
yep.
yeah, right -- whatever.
of course you shouldn't. you don't know how to do it. dunking's an art. don't let it soak so long. a dip and plop, into your mouth. if you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. it's all a matter of timing. i ought to write a book about it.
possibly some coffee?
shopping here?
billy prince is asking you to prom.
i do.  you seek the holy grail.
a mistake?  that was no mistake.
i have a headache.
yes, that's the trouble with mothers. first you get to like them and then they die.
this is years ago, before he joined special forces, i guess. we had an argument.
why'd you come back?
no. not at all,
here we go...
nothing.  so good luck.
do you know what that lillian bercovici just did?
keeping an eye on dr. duval...
how come you don't like me?
oh it's just a rental. i'm moving to the east side soon. i've got a couple of deals brewing with gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? like dinner. the two of us. friday. cafe. santo domingo.
both, sir.
i'm not exactly sure... it looks close. did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
oh, yeah?
for what?
why, mr. conway, you surprise me!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
i guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
shoot him? like with a gun?
i guess. i don't know. how do you remember your phone number?
need a ride?
are you kidding?
don't see me to my door, there's no need.
you know, the more i think about it, this really isn't david's kind of place.
oh nice save.
my office is a dump, i answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
oh, shut up. i thought it might help you get some sleep.
zach my boy, i can spend your yearly salary in a blink. i have had that kind of money all of my life. if i wanted to, i could fly to paris for the afternoon.  my father formed this company over seventy years ago. when my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. now running a bank of this size is very stressful. i need to relax on what little down time i have. a yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. understand ?
that's my mom.  i'll get 'em in a sec.
the creature?
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
that was very good.
but what about the past? our past?
but father, it's not fair.
sure. i finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when i was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
hello.
i'm a writer. ted o –
mr. congeniality?  let him find his own clues.  there's a journal article in this somewhere.
well you did.
you know, i been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
oh, there you are, mister turkle.
yes.
the ones in the box of files.  the box of files?  the one from your office?
what do you have?
if the pay's right i'll do it.
hey. look. there must be something.
oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  we're just about to start cutting in.  you're welcome to stick around if you want.  it's really fascinating stuff.
she's been marked for it. the house does that. happened to pritchett's father. likely happen to you all. isn't that what you told me, mr. pritchett?
and we won't stretch up our arms...
fuck you and stay off the phone.
but i ain't got you...
no.
one-ball mccall?
how much time?
i'm on to you.  you're a faker.  you aren't dying.
oh, please give me back my dog!
dreyfuss.
where are you,...al?
greedy.
you been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
he sold the feed to me, didn't he?
no. the bathroom is off limits -and when i go to sleep they go to other programming. unless i get up. then they go back on the air. unless i get up to go to the bathroom, i guess, then -
what does he do? is he an actor?
it'll hurt the box office.
because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
you got something to hide?
phoenix asteroids? never heard of 'em.
good. you're just what i need right now.
what'll i do with this card?
you say she killed a policeman?
yes, we had, uh...
did you see that?  that was a w.w.f. hit right there, huh, day-day?
i'm as jewish as fucking tevye
oh?  perhaps someone pushed you then?
i am better.
so--friendly or otherwise--?
you promised justice.
<i>the bounty hunters have arrived. they will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>where do you want to meet?</i>
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? a maid comes in -- a french maid.
if ed ever found out....
look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? ya hit or sit, martini?
no, i don't have the right.  you're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
no.  they're beyond that!  they're smarter than the humans.  what's <u>more</u> advanced?
you know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
how old are you?
it's about my salary cheques.
let's call that a start.
cole...
then why are you talking about this?
the wrong word, maybe.  delete that. and, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
she saved our lives.
here's how they're organized. groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for.  and they all score high on the insomnia charts.
no. but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other. if you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
do you know lily?  phil..do you know her?
don't start.
ready.
what can it hurt.
john thinks i'm so snotty.
no, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
and maybe my lawyer.
why would lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
good seeing you again.
nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
sure.  want to try that new italian place?
because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. gary, i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when i get mad.  no one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
<u>bobby</u>...
encourage them to be bolder.
you looked like you did?
everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
how's loomis?
and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
you know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
he say anythin'... the kid... ?
you're cold.
well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
he was an m.p. in bangkok back in '21. caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in berne. then, last september... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
mr. reed, please, for mr.  brandon.  very well. have him call. mr. brandon is in his office now.  mr. reed stepped out, mr.  brandon.
i'm not sure why i came here. i had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
how did it end?
i'm not going anywhere. we're a team.
nothing.
tough break.
so do i. over and over.
i look at it as how many i've saved. that's the way you've got to look at it.
you can ride like that?
aw, come, come, come --
rose?
you've either got it or you don't.  let your conscience be your guide?
how about a deal?
oh your a pilgrim all right. i saw it on your face back there in the dust. i saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes. would you like a drink? 
i'm gonna punch you. what you want with her anyway? you in love with her?
it's all just business to you. him.  me.  your life. everything's business.
i've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. it's an even ten who say shu's gun killed jimmy chin!
now, that's all right, isn't it?
i don't want to go.
not so bad. we'll get you to medical quarters. you're going to be fine.
i understand... if you could tell me who employed you, miss sessions. that could help us both.
give me the district attorney's office.  i'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the state penitentiary.  hello, d'arrasty! this is hartwell. come over to my office, will you? i've just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions.
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
yeah.  two weeks.  i didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
but, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
then you shouldn't have to ask.
my apologies, madam.
snow covered fortress. army of bad guys. the usual.
hello, steve.  i'm glad you could come.
how much you got?
sure. mostly often.
and i don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
ya gotta keep tabs on your "eleanors", memphis. cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
from a chicken, bug-wit.
hah! you don't know me, boy.
why would i do that?
i say, fuck 'em.  let's go.
you know what you remind me of?
i don't know!  i don't know. there's a lot of things going on here that i don't understand. truth takes time.
hey!  mr. big shot.
johnny. supernova.
i've got something...
you're ayip!
owwww...you're hurting me... you're hurting me...i hate you ...i hate you...
well... i ought to be getting home anyway.  the kids'll be back from camp soon.  the house is probably a mess.
dad, are we hit?!
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
165  continued:  
hello, doc.
is the hospital covered?
...could i get you to call loretta and tell her i've gone to odessa? goin' to visit with carla jean moss.
hamlet.  what's david berkowitz got to do with sid 6.7?
your life?
hiya, lou.
i'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am i right?
not her, the one with the little...
okay, okay, okay--
yes! the only thing that matters is the grail.
oh. i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
the foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  i hope you'll forgive me but i thought you'd...
conversation...yes...well...  wasn't she briefed?
why didn't you get into bed?
c'mon.
the receptionist said you called earlier about something.
hello, rick.
subtle?
cia policy?  the cia has no policy, mr. helms.  except what i dictate to you ...  i try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago.
the stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. do you know what i mean? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
you're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? you almost sound like him.
so we'll guard her together. through the night.  in each others' arms like we always said.
fuck, it's freezing.
have you talked to eric?
ted...?
she's pretty.
if we run into billy first, let me try and talk him in.
do you know where david took me tonight, star?  do you?!
okay, we're going to naples. there's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
bruised.
what are they?
we need signatures.  to overturn the ballot.  i can supply those, oswald.
did christmas come early this year...?
hi.  my wonderful junk yard. the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
have you done this sort of thing before?
ain't all of us gonna make it.
what, vincent?  this is me, doll.  i know you.  what did you think you were doing?  running to the cops.  hiding out. no, no.  you're sorry now, aren't you?
all you got to do is name it.
stars... when a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
honey, just leave it.
so then she just stops calling.
i've never accepted that privilege, and i'm now on french soil.
you use their witness.
you greased the rails!
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
mrs. jankis, what do you want from me?
we can't carry all this.  it's too heavy.
obviously.
...shut up, sue...
hey there. they're showing "groundhog day" if you...
yeah, well, what do you care, walter?
oh really? what's the verdict?
i understand.  that's already been taken care of.  now you appreciate i can only work with the raw material i have at my disposal but for a little extra...i could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
what the fuck you doing!
ay, yi, yi!  the rangers are going to be crushed!
what are you doing?
get me on the am shows, larry king, cover of the journal...  i've got to do something about this scar. make sure they only shoot my right side.
hey butt-head, i'm starting to feel weird. i think i'm freaking out.
they found him. poor fucker was practically blown in half --
you know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
this is sweet!!
no. i didn't. i swear i didn't. i probably helped push you to kill yourself, but i didn't do it.
i can't wait to get there.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  his parents are at his bedside.  fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"...
i went to a few just to meet women. but i don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. during that whole scene i just drank in bars.  who didn't make the cut?
go!
wanna drink.
...remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
you were holding it upside down weren't you?
cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand i'd be tripping...
does it burn?
why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
we were attacked by a werewolf.
oh, my god, are they vegetarians? that's not in here...
cut it out, sam.
we rented a car.
are you here to help me?
he pushed into me... i couldn't stop him... it hurt.
david, i promise we will. keep him happy.
i have to go.
you don't have any baggy shorts? pajama bottoms?
i wouldn't. if i were in his shoes, every morning i'd get up singing, man. do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of coors lite. then i'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit. so i'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. and then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan.
oh, and your line to charles atlas in there: "i'll take that gun", "you'll have to".
i don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  and i buy my own clothes.  my life's a little boring...
where?
whatever happens next.....
it means she's screwed up.
do you still want to meet?
what are you doing?
oh, i'll "get it." i'll "get it" all right. i might even take seconds.
i don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. i just got to have certain information. what's your name?
harry?
because, my dear will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  have you seen blood in moonlight, will? it appears quite black. if one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
you got any coffee?
are you crazy?  you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
fag.
i am michael simonovitch iranoff.
can i make a statement?  if you request me to go back to washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  can you take me with you?
well, we worked on the school paper together. i remember when the legion of decency declared rebel without a cause unfit...boy...that jim backers, what an actor uh? what an actor.
i'm sorry, major kong.  i guess i was way out of line.
"to the love of my life, love, doug"?
fuck you. you owe it to me. tomorrow i'm gonna wake up and i'll be fifty and i'll still be doin' this. and that's all right 'cause i'm gonna make a run at it. but you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. and that's bullshit 'cause i'd do anything to have what you got! and so would any of these guys. it'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
... but we shouldn't have fired him...
i do, sir.
there's our man.
so what do you say? can we be friends?
without your pants.
i'm pretty nervous. are you?
you waved to me in the elevator.
we lost cousins, friends.  we will wash this in blood.
oh, see - i killed it. oh, i killed that poor little honey bee!
it's that lady from norfolk again.
sorry.
are those cameras all throughout the house?
you said it!
why, dad?
karl, what are you doing here? come in.
oh lord. you think i'm so dense. and now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. you want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. you want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... you don't really know what this feels like.
so much for honor among thieves. you would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
what're you doin'?
that is correct.
you mean he might have -- mr. bartholomew, i'm catching the next plane out of here -- i'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
some weather we're having.  must be from all the meshugass at cape canaveral.  you locked out of your apartment?
elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
enough about me, what's happening with you?
—do you?
and deep down i'm a good person? make no mistake, dewey, i'm a shit.
how long is that gonna take?
gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. we need help.  where is the old girl?
what?
that's all right.  there is nothing anyone can do about it.  you can call me luke.
he said he'd kill me.
how about family? got any family?
mr. saavik, all stop.
you know, in russia, there's no work for women. it's a different world.
you're a good friend.
what's that?
this isn't gonna work.
what are you crazy?
has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
all my life i've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. well this is it. this is power!
you're the one who found the bodies?
you have an unusual hand.
i've been aware of that for some time.
let's go back, barry...
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! he is better than that!
thank you.
...i can't make it tonight.
and yet you started the engine right up.  with all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  did that strike you odd?
what effect do you think this would have on an infant?
whatta you mean, forget it?
oh my god!
i'm afraid not. i promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
hmm?
okay, what do you want? what dumb favor do you want me to do?
you like this house, max?
just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
no radio source.  nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
i get it.  no sweat. you'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. and you'll have him by coffee time.
what? did the politburo just one day say - "we give up?"
i can't do it.
alright. i'll start at the top, and work down.
...but she's, no, betty's smarter than that. she wouldn't be here for a...
it works.
there's a new virus in the database.
of bodies.
are you alright?  what is it?
i don't need your gratitude.
mr. president, i'd like you to meet my dear friend, mr. chauncey gardiner.
find me something, i don't care where it is.
well, you know...good days, bad days.
gardens.  all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. they're like little villages.
i dunno .. guess the dozer musta shifted him? you need some hands up here to look ..
do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
exactly, but... exactly. ooooh!
don francesco.  you murdered my husband, because he would not bend. and his oldest son paolo, because he swore revenge.  but vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  he never speaks.
i don't want to fight, george.
my pocketbook.
the thought had crossed my mind.
okay by me - i'd sure like to see that opryland.
the ladder?
yes, i'll bet.
what are you saying?
oh.
mickey!
how ya doin', ainge? evenin', lily.
teh... tehronne?
we don't know of anything, master...
that's part of the reason i dropped by. i need to learn this stuff.
bullshit.  getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  besides, we do have a choice.
do you miss your home, captain? have you someone there?
'cause i wanna watch the knicks on television.
damn. 'have to go back over there.  be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
maybe we should do some exercise.
nick, i gotta tell you, i got pinched twice for no reason. you really gotta be careful. i'm running a licensed place. everything's legit.
abu kaleem malik.
do you have everything?
new york city?
it isn't worth getting a heart attack over, lois.
what's the award?
he has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  he gave dorothy a coach- and-six.  that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  faith, the business was well done.  your cousins, michael and harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to england, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to dublin.  are you in want of cash, my boy?  you may draw upon me, for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
oh? 
you've been real good to me, too. it ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. you and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
motion sensors.  looks like zone three.
oh, i used to be such a catholic.
it doesn't matter.    it'll work out.
in front of greely's. it says, "this here is what happens to..."
a little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
how could you not *care* about the movie?
okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  you need to seek the help of a trained --
i did, sir.
okay, i guess. it's so intimidating. you know being away from home, not knowing anyone. i feel like such a geek sometimes. everyone's so cool and i'm so not.
what about the water...
she believed you?
don't feed that dog.
you want me to go around --
that's how dry cleaning works.  now i'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
you can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight!
from the sun.  it's a reflection on the glass.
larry....
you better not miss, friend.
why did she do it?
sure.  okay.  fine.  can you pass on a message?
i'm going on staff at the n.s.f.  to work for drumlin.
four.  four years --
are you okay?
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
have you ever done that before?  pulled someone into your dream?
there are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. this is not a toy. i've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. worshipping, schwartz, worshipping properly.
excuse me, mr. crandall--i've got to change this kid. it's nice to meet you.
roy! what are you doing in san diego?
she grew up.
jeez, louise, that wasn't very nice.
what's he looking for?
what the devil?
that's lord frederick tessier. owns most of freeside. wintermute's mainframe is centred in the royal family's villa.
i didn't do it.
no.  you said the one.  that's why you said we couldn't talk till kenilworth.
sounds smashing.  i'm in.  muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  now be serious.  you couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
as i am sure you are aware, professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why i've given them special consideration.
betty elms?
..."the devil?"...
ha-ha-ha. i'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. that shit robs you of your ambition.
relax.  we're almost there.
i just dislocated my finger.
i'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
well, mom, he's the first to admit it.  he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice.
my first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
well, yes, he'll talk. well, no, no. you'll have to teach him to talk.
it's too dangerous.
was i money?
what?
perhaps, later, when things are settled, when jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
it never used to be.  you were two left feet on the dance floor.  like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
i wish i could.
lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
as large as castles.  you are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
that maid saw us.  she could identify us too.
look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
but he never ends up marrying her. strange.
well... i have to take this over to debi.
figures.
he is dead?
no.  don't open your mouth!  you <u>honestly</u> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
gee, i hope they don't have a fight out there.  you don't think they'll call it off...?
it doesn't matter how much we're played with.  what matters is that we're here for andy when he needs us.  that's what we're made for. right? everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
i beg your pardon!
i am so tired of your bullshit, bernie.
i'll be right back with mrs. wheeler.
no.
gee whiz, dad--
well, not exactly. see, i met this girl. real nice girl. god-fearing girl. her name's sylvia.
poor color composition, lousy use of space. but that shit doesn't really concern me.
we have a lot of work to do.
yes.
hold on there - i don't want this pomade, i want dapper dan.
you should always work with a spotter.
i think i prefer to see my client privately.
jesus mercy, that's charlie higgins, dave laller ...
a certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
i'm not hungry.
eughh. sounds horrible.
you said things would be fine, and they're not.
glad to meet you, too.  you are all your father talks about.
now... i'm in ...
and what do you see?
...would you use a small word?
atley jackson came to see me ...
what do you think of him?
okay, you win.  i'll call you mom. now can i move into the dorms?
smoking is bad for your heart, michael.
ain't that too bad! tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
bullet resistant?  whatever happened to bullet proof?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
cut it out.
it's possible. just negotiate.
ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
what does that even mean?
god rest her soul.
and of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
order!
trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
gimme the ball!
full scholarships.  princeton too.  she wanted to stay close.
oh, but i'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
see that. they're gone!
he will not!
this is not an easy situation.
continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
it wouldn't have made any difference.
...may be the heat....
because she's visiting me.
are you torturing me on purpose?
it didn't go off.
you're just like you mother! always jealous!
when, may i ask?
no. what are you looking for?
this same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. como se llama, amigo?
of course not.
why don't you just have the guts to admit it
i'm just tellin' you. don't say i didn't warn you.
sorry.
you're not my brother.  the brother i knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck archer.  at least tell me the bomb is still going off.
that's weird --
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
i don't know.
you remember where you got this eleanor -- ?
we got the wire ya was comin'. you're the indian official, yeah?
okay. go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
you've been back to dallas?
here i am lecturing you.  have some pâté.
like you'd get if it was hand held.
this is the first time i've seen him in years.  i didn't want him to think i was high-hatting him.
a million things could have caused those problems.  poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  our offer is final and more than fair.
i promised i'd go right home after school.
hi...
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland.
yeah. it's close by, that's what's creepy. they've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
i heard about your sister, and i... understand your pain...
we've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
wow. you ever see her again?
engaged.  plan on doing it this summer.  you still married?
oh.
and when do you betray us again?
hush.
crabtree.
i wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, david -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
yes.
and being sixteen.
we've arranged for you to take the blame.  everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
well, what if?
and what you going to do?
into stargher.  inside...
vit the fuhrer, of course.  he liked me.  out of all the household staff at berchtesgarten, i vas his favorite.  i vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
oh yeah? oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? federal express? hm? by the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. total waste. cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
dino droppings?
but you have to.  they said you would.
where's your brother?
what is this place?
why are there still such headlines?
he's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the supreme court. he really must be crazy. he's gonna go to washington with this?  he's out of his fuckin' mind.
would you excuse me? i think i'm going to go to bed.
go where? you can't get away from people like this.
all right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
some say that's the way of it.
your suit is fitted desert fashion. who told you how to do that?
she says juliet's in a terrible state . . .
do you think we'd cheat?
it's a bucket of vomit.
because i'd be to blame, right?
real good, chet... it's been awhile.
none taken.
you smell like baby powder.
that's not me. i didn't... i'm not doing that.
which god would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  in your world, the lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. but in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
i really don't think that's necessary treves. i'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach.
you can wire home for some money when we get to jacksonville.
i will stop this car right now.
i kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
what is it, paul.
think of it as special assignment, mrs. peel. with a twist. you're our chief suspect.
hours instead of days, saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
an old junker. like a reservation car. blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. new mexico plates. a ford or ah, yeah, a ford.
what?
cool pictures.  you a fan?
david hasn't seen him either.
you get what you pay for.
oh, i'm afraid i couldn't get away, sam.
you missed a hell of a game, frank.
i'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  you know what i mean by "changes"?
driving?
yeah, he can go ...
excellency, may i present my niece.
welcome, mr. miller.  jim garrison. would you care for some coffee?
nerves of steel.
nels, don't let that cop pass you.
we're very lucky.
it's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
they outnumber us, my lord --
what are you doing?
come on, i thought we had fun, rich boy --
the nightmares.
yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  right?!  well you figured wrong, dork!
well...
while you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
i ain't gonna tell you no more. no pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. you're killing your own people asshole.
i mean walter owns the sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
what?
yeah, i swiped it from ms. rancick.
what is this?
well, i wouldn't call it an elegant profession. it's in a lower social scale. people look down on butchers.
chicken shit.  where were we?
good night, alice.
margaret, take william and susan to the river shed.  hide there.  if we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the richardson's house. they'll take you to your aunt charlotte's farm.  nathan, samuel, and i are going to get gabriel.
i mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
why don't we go together?
i'm sorry, i did my best, i thought the certificates would save us all.
blue, then.
small town on the eastern side no one's ever heard of called bari.
i called gerta rauss. she says she can represent both of us. they call it "collaborative divorce." it's apparently all the rage right now. and it's easy because we don't have children.
she must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
merde! just missed!
peter lassiter...
please.  sit down.  we'll drink some scotch.
oh. i thought maybe --  gee!
the patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
i don't know.  i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  he knew he was holdin' ya back.
i don't think i can go on, sir.
we just smeared a skunk.
of course i do -- i never knew what money really meant till i started spending it. do you know --  i can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from preysing -- i'll take care of you. will -- will you let me?
seriously.
that's not really a very proper question.
i sympathize with you kids.  the best i can do is call the station in carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
monsters?  the only monsters...  ...are here.
what if she isn't?  where are your priorities?  you have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
yes... and in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
you might think -- i thought so myself at first -- that burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. but that's the very reason to beware! it's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
mordechai. do you love your mother?
you have my word on that.
we're too young.
what?
then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
i'll be delighted.
i know.  jean-pierre did.
beetle!
that was some shit, huh?
we did the decent thing.
i eat.
first of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. we're already on the list to be heard before the supreme court of the united states later this year.
there's a rumour... i don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der null.
wow.  do a puppet show for me, craig honey.
i ran out of bribes. bizimungu took them away.
now what is up with that?
they aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
i'm okay.
you were right.  it's nothin' like i thought.  i almost wish...
get it through your head, little girl; i'm not going for you.  if this toby likes you, then if i were you i'd marry him.  you're not going to get much better in this town.
won him over just like that.
you don't like public enemy?  it's the dope shit.
indeed. just a moment - as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him. a very appropriate person to do so. yes.
radio said negative five.
[beat] i've seen a time that's not this time. and i'm only able to see it when i'm in the jacket.
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
weapons storage...
you bet.
so, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
where?  show me where.
i'm not asking you for help, mike. just take off the handcuffs.
my blood?  i ... i gave at the office.
she, too, is a great admirer of yours.
mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  they'll see the fucking smoke from canada.
we're going to steal a ship?  that ship?
let's go.  time to move out.
i thought i'd stay the night.
she looks just like you.
--  now to recap, i want to stay in arizona, i want my new contract, i like you, you're nice to my wife, i will stay with you, that's what i'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. you listening?
sure. anyplace in particular?
great, great. that's fantastic.
they did.
thanks, patrick.
frank!
well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and i am.
it made them holy.
maybe we didn't want to come back.
you would be. they tore me apart.
wait a minute, wait a minute.  we can still handle this.  can we still handle this?
don't go.
a better friend.
how about another beer?
and that was only my first try.
should i be ?
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. he feels no pain. he can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
i am not crazy, tyrell. he was right there.
right.  she's only fourteen.
who the hell are you?
so, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...and you had to kill him?
but how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
hmm. to protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. the emperor knew, as i did, if anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
and you listen to that?
do what?
where does it make berth?
he broke because of me. i saw it. he lost all will to fight.
was it sister marguerite who knew about the baby?  alright agnes, i want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
c’mon, you know what i like to hear...
sorry. i didn't know...
jack, we're not living in the same country you and i knew in '46.  our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  we can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  hell, the arabs and the japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
you like it?
let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, giulia. that would be really sensational.  come on, giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
i'll take your suggestion under advisement, princess.  in the meanwhile --
about an hour and a half, because that's all the longer i've been gone.
what are you doing?
ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  not even a detail?   you must try.
that's the last.
you are a friend of his?
you can't, it's too dangerous.
cathy?
i don't sing very well.
absolutely.
big day coming up--i wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. but he went so unexpected.
i'm going to my desk.
it was off the statue.  in the club.
so how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
go. i command you.
when the hell did you write that?
meaning what?
you've made a wonderful impression. your views are liberal... it is easy to see you have an open mind.
there are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  but they're all part of two warring factions. one:  families that have held wealth for centuries. they want one thing.  stability. group two:  the boat rockers. eisenhower's military industrial complex.  they want instability. it's a trillion dollar a year business.  when there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
tell me about beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
if i could go back to farming --
hello?
he's missing.  he's gone.  he left.
well, maybe we should talk ab...
what's the point?
yes.
can i ask you somethin', lieutenant? how come you're doing this?  i mean, we're kinda curious.
bianca's taught me all! need to know. i'll be safe, as long as i don't go too far.
both of them?
i have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
all i know is -- it's not brooke.
i don't want to show up hammered. we're supposed to be representing max.
you were saying...
i took off my gloves today - with aaron -  - and it was okay.
get the... midnight... express.
yes sir. right then it was.
how can he be playing chess with you? you're not making any moves against him.
i wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the riker maneuver...
why, sure. it won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
are you two all right? did you see that!? they left! we made it! i think we made it!
poor billy-boyfriend. an innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
who is that young man?
the cloak invisible. it was my mother's parting gift.
you blaming god. that what you're doing?
you said you wanted these.
my dear president...  read it back...
maybe that is his boat.
so this means you've reconsidered our deal on mr. lovejoy?
it's ours.
no -- no, thanks.
is it the sex thing? am i being too pushy?
i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
where are you going?
that lets us off the hook.
i know –– i know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
i have no idea.
he's a miserable twit!
ow.
i didn't want it to end this way.  i wanted hauser back.  but nooo.  you had to be quaid.
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty.
kids' game a couple galaxies over.
i know i did. but i don't.
thanks, max.  i'm touched by your concern.
milton's not a killer. he's a pervert. he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
there's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
bruce, look! dad got some german jam.
this is your plan, finch?
no, you wouldn't let me.  and i don't want to go...
when you didn't come to the club.
two weeks.
you ever had to open it up like that before?
clay phillips.
young masbath, i am sorry for your loss.  it is a great and sad tragedy. however... i cannot be the one to look after you now.
i checked the files. this one holds the record for shock treatments. four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
with all due respect to merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. but he has no right to stop others.  ever hear of the first amendment?
the first guys to the car when jack and i got there were bruening and carlisle.
you and kay were like sisters?
look at the way the little punk is driving.  he's all over the place.  look-- he hasn't signalled once.
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
i got it.
bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
okay.
we? don't blame me!
no, i promise...  not a chance. i own this guy. there was no one else. i'm on the move too much. trust me.
i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
i'm sorry.  i was too late.
i wish you'd talk to me.  we can figure it out, you know.  we can figure it out together.
what's got billy so spooked?
i haven't got the energy.  i mean, i have to conserve my energy.
what, honey?
where have you been hiding?
he's a menace to the whole world! it's our duty to turn him in.
i haven't brushed yet.
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
i asked you...
it doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  it's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  like you both know something.  but then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "what if i had stopped and said something?"  it might happen only a few times in your life.
excuse me.
brains aren't everything.
the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
got vodka in it now. gotta give it a new name. hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. what's your name?
who?
i had a feeling you would say something like that. so i brought us dinner.
they crashed it into a wall.  a flight <i>simulator</i>.
"bring me a side order of mrs. wheeler."
but if you're one of the misfits... that's where i come in.
okay.  good night.
thanks a lot, daddy. you really came through for me.
what?
maybe you and brooke could come over to the town beach....
how do you know this?
it wasn't the gold.  it was the claymore mine.  the gold's in my pack.
it's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
that's a bit much.
how about this?
i told you no calls.
yeah. like you said, you know. i guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
good night, papa.
you killed him!  come on with the rest of it. you killed him!
then you go to the left. there's a landing.
...brainerd?
how was school?
what did you tell him?
well, state's got a good business school.  and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  green peppers?
what does it say?
he's activated a transport inhibitor.
sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that's it.
hi. sarah knottingham.
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video, respectively. as such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
yeah... you just want me to wave, right?
for what?
what does he do, this bert gordon?
my fuckin' head.
lowe's car-?
i'm tired, paul. so tired. i have to rest a while.
and when will you be ready to do that?
oh yeah.
excuse me. excuse me!
do you get paid a lot?
what color underwear am i wearing?
fucking mariners.
goddamnit!  goddamnit!
yes, isn't he.
-- where does this come from? --  how do you have my picture?
we expect an attack on the convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and i have been placed in charge of its defense.
go ahead--punch.
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews. but--  i have things here you said and wrote. listen to this: 'the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international.' and what about this: 'jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' you deny you said these things?
but they're nighttime hunters, hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
are you from washington originally?
buck duff.  i was in maxwell's boost in troy.
avoid-all-contact-day.
yes. we're in danger here. every moment we stay.
captured?  how?
agent mulder --

the capitol dome! lighted up!
the old man has his own way of doing things
don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
elena, it's not what you think. it's not a big plot. honestly. honestly. i don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. i don't feel good about it. i know i've done what i didn't want to do. i don't know --
why don't we accept, animal? the worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
are you in love with someone else?
ten percent.
that's what she would say herself.
what do you mean, "good looking?"
from the cook, sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
how do you like it, nicole?
admiral, may i suggest that dr. mccoy is correct. we must help chekov.
it's written all over you like a neon sign. now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better.
yeah, well, you fixed that.  what the hell happened, anyway?
oh, that's nice.  i'd love to see her wind up settled.  she's a tense one. 
how was your trip? profitable?
which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
a wiseguy. paying 100 grand for the rapists if i turn then over direct to him.
i need a favor.
open it.
charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
so, where'd you go today.
she's in the desert. she's out in the desert.
beats me.  look, jackie-boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to matt reynolds.  he's tripping the light fantastic with tammy jordan at 2245 maravilla, hollywood hills.  it's right around the corner.
god, you're sick.
don't you believe it.
but it's so good, i mean... it's so very good.
i wish i was your wife. i wish i had your kids.
grow up, johnny. you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
that was so good i am gonna have another.
how 'bout this?  how'd neptune know where to hit us?  huh?  whose op sec's got a leak?  yours?
elizabeth, i'm prescribing hypnocyl.  it's a dream suppressant.
no! don't you understand?? he's got my e-ticket! he's got my -
right now, curly. it can't wait.
he's not talking about himself.
so how long is this trip?
why would he pick this one?
cheaper i guess, take us both down in one van.
i'll boil some water.
still here...thinking...  you mean brazil, the country?
yeah, i guess i do.
what should i be, a white inferior- ist? a multicultural zulu egalitarian? let me ask, where are your people from?
what the hell was all that about?
what you just said. say it again.
sarah, do you think i'm a loser?
all right. when <u>is</u> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
oh, you're not going. you're staying.
alright agnes... it's alright. one, two three...  it's alright... it's me, doctor livingston, it's alright, alright. thankyou agnes, thankyou. how do you feel?
you are writing another book, aren't you? that's why you're here. the story's not over.
yeah, then what?
good. good.  i have thought of calling for a royal commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  i think i could guarantee they would recommend the act be repealed.
you've done nothing but get rich off of me. how many books have you sold, gale? you think i don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
what?  what?
fuck this, let's get something to eat...
this has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
hey, eve!
that's tony mccoy.  he's playing lieutenant dick craig.
not according to my charts. do you have an appointment?
c'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
you told me that on the phone. what the hell are you doing here? showing off your communication skills? go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
we should tell him we're not going.
i've wanted a friend too. i've been lonely.
first, we may as well decide on gender. have you given it any thought?
they are live ones?
leave it to me.
i couldn't help it, wyatt.  i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face.  i mean these people're afraid to even walk down the street and i'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture.  that's not me, that's somebody i don't even know.
you're chuck noland.
god creates man, man creates technology, technology creates god.  end into beginning.

why did you want her body?
coffee, ed?

i'm your future husband, remember?
that dude who works for valentine.  he's the one sent those guys after you.  you know that.
i love my blender.
jesus christ.
oh, for chrissakes. it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
climb the corporate ladder, boy. don rocco.
but it's comfortable.
what did you say your name was, sweetheart?
what does that do?
teddy, hon, are you okay?  oh heavens to pete!
oh
as friends -- always as friends.
you're my girl, aren't you?
what?
i thought i'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
go ahead...if you want to. it doesn't matter.
then why ain't he dead?
would you like your things now?
so what's the deal?
well, we have one lead and that's what i'm looking into next.
you see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  it won't be long till they're calling you senator filmore--
mr. reynolds!
no one would blame me if i left!
you're doomed. i'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. right there in that tub.
the one about the siberian bloodhound?
hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  but, this was a fat guy.  the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. and, writing on the walls happens all the time.  it's like the fashionable thing to do.
billy, i love you i really do... but i've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
that, my dear conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
i wouldn't drop my gun.
twenty-six months.
josephine and i have a lot in common.
we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
i bet lizzy told him where to put it.
projecting joy is not my job.
what were you doing in felton?
now that's a really big house.
great.  i got some wine.
harold, i think you're getting carried away here.
boy or girl?
i had to see you.
sanchez...?  hey, who...
let me just check on my boy.
charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  the only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
good times.
go fuck yourself.
you know he would have done you, too.
who lives?
okay, baby. okay...
a little ol' boy.
jack, she's innocent!
i don't know... i'm getting these <u>cramps</u>!
[south america.]
'a moray eel....'
form a brute squad then. i want the thieves' forest emptied before i wed.
uh-huh. till my wing[4] went bad.
it won't work.
i, uh, i have some problems.
how long would the interview take?
thanks for coming.
i understand that.
maybe once upon a time.  but that was long ago.  back before... before it became what it is.
listen to me.  is there a gas station nearby?
we've got to get you out of here.
why is it important to you? if i inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
it'll never wash.  pardoning them means we're guilty.  the people, the press will go nuts.
yeah, i saw her.  bitch took my wheels.
no, this is the center of the universe.  if i were living in roman times, i would live in rome, where else?  today, america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself. john lennon.
that's because you keep reminding me. if you go away then i'll forget.
catherine!
melissa!
guess i just got sick of him.
i'm getting scared.
in a dress.
important? of course it's important. the point is we can do something about it.
do we run into the street? no, i didn't think so.  nice car. how's that place?
not really.  you see your goal and you go after it.  anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
the line's over there.
excuse me?
i can't believe tommy's still pissed at me. he knows i'm moving away, right?
what else have you got?
did you go?
i won't.
you have blood on your pants.
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
they're turning around.
i always felt i could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
he's a good student.
a true and troubling question, gump... we'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  the baron must have left a trail.
you stay here a minute.
ellen.
tom, i've got something real big for you.
i'm not, but there's some of it i don't see any sense to.
i gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
okay?
right.
thank you...
give it back.
that's how long you were gone.
you're not capable of it.
no, no, we haven't the time. talk prose. where is my play?
basically, yeah.
what gentleman, maria?
in this there is a chance. if i live, i can try to free you. if we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. none. i can do nothing. do you understand?
the father. the father.
here, officer, take me in. i'm clean. i didn't do it. got a ticket once in jersey. that's all. honest, officer.
come on. frozen. how much are they?
at the finish, it's single action by two, fasanella second, visitation third.  line on single action... 3 to 2. hell with it, that's no good.
fact of the matter - there never was!
no, no, no.  certainly not.  i wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. was that unclear?
you took that money from julia's hand.
congratulations. you passed the test.
you were good.
hi.
oh, my!
that's it, it's go time.
four thousand.
it could have been worse, john.  it could have been a lot worse.
a target, kendall, cap a fucking target. what's wrong with you?
still alive.  hmm.  i suppose that doesn't bode well for poor bruno.
mr. chekov, when do those devices activate?
no!  i'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
what?
what?!
what happened?
i figure a couple of months. that's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
but chickens?
i know this may seem like a strange question, but can i ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, i know you're a professional, but just for me, i was just wondering.
it's wood. it's fake. five years ago i was engaged to be married. johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn't paying attention. the slicer chewed off my hand. it's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that i was maimed, she left me for another man.
your soul...?  why should i bother with such a paltry trifle?
okay, here's mine.  my name is special agent jones.
keep june first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. and give warner our love.
what about our friend - sark?
yes, but how often?  tell me, are you happy?
i collect spores, molds and fungus.
impressions? those are hard.
he was doing his job, protecting the girl. if police were involved, you figure it out. i'm here for him.
now can i tell?
please sir, don't beat me up. i do have a kiss ticket, but not on me.
he's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
she soars -
you are.
i think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
that's good.  sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. it's very embarassing.
good -- also, give it to the papers and tv.
you know each other?
i want you to see my room. i want you to see all of it.
gerald wants to see him first.
and you want to use me to get him?
it wasn't my fault. i was just part of a team. i was doing my job...
david?
i'll call her later.
we're doing it tonight.
aren't you going to say anything?
ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
toss 'im overboard!
i'll be damned.
it's not serious, it's just training. you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
i've struck my blow.
show me some respect, you little asshole. it's special officer tannen to you.
... you see what i'm getting at here? she got a penthouse up there with color tv and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when i ask for money!
it's almost impossible to find, especially on cd.  yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  but every other echo and the bunnymen album --
you happy?
it's not about sex, ben. i'll make you up a bed on the sofa. do it for me. we can talk till late and then sleep till late. as you know, i am my own boss.
my old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
here's the picture of my wife.
yes, well...  famished.
negative. he's established a security field around the control room...
john... what's the matter? john... why are you upset?
you're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
are you going to leave, too?
are you trying to be funny?
karen, say hello to chili palmer. chili, this is karen flores.
'bye, mom.
who did it?
wow. you did that for me?
so let's do it.
patrick, please. i hope i've been informative. long day-a bit scattered.
jesus...
dr. crowe.
uh-huh i'm sure. i've killed someone! oh my god i've actually killed someone!
why not?
i don't think we should meet again.
a little?
coincidences happen.  you run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  split-second tragedy happens every day.  or maybe...
but it's so far away...
why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
it's so cold.
how do you say nineteen?
yep.  maggie -- someone to see you.
why aren't you there?
but you're not enrolled.
c'mon, just do it.
<u>find</u> it.
mama...
i brung you a little basket of goodies. fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
please. you owe me.
no.  i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
--the calan.  do you know who they are?
what a mess.
what'd they take?
i-i couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
well, ill tell you this. i have learned a lesson tonight. i wasn't gonna run around, but when i start botherin' your daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, i gotta face the facts of life.  tomorrow mornin', i'm gonna get myself up and go out.
i could be you rguard!  i could carry your spear!
so... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  she was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the maytag. listening.
just an accident. he's all right. will you drive? he needs stitches.
there are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, master
thanks for reminding me.
ever talk to him?
he pulled us over as we left the riviera tennis club.  claimed we'd run a stop sign.  and when elliot was reaching for his license --
i told you it would happen. it's bound to happen when a man works alone!
asked what they looked like, that's all. christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
i need this one.
i need the wayne diamonds.
but ... you did it before!  last time --
no. nothing is nothing. i want wally to come home. i'm afraid to see him, too.
yes, ma'am.
who's she talking to?
come on, man.  what else could it be?
what does he say?
where the hell is his body?
well, i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
you didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
you "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  typical.  what does this virus attack?  don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  have i ever "developed" a virus?  do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  wow!  and i'm crazy!
nope.  back then we did not.
no act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. as life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
wake up, lex! we just watched jam's mom torch our fuckin' kiss tickets! not reo speedwagon! not journey! not the bay city rollers! kiss! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, i'd sure like to hear it!
stan and i're okay.
how are you feeling?
y'know, uncle frank...
you knew?
it was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. it was simple, whatever it was.  then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good.  it's been a long time.
oh look at that.
hey, did you hear that?
sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. i'm nothing. it wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the congress.  hey, you thirsty? you like orange whips?
how can you read that again?
i played piano in a few places.
oh shit.  hello? director's office.
you didn't have to kill sophie.
you're just talking nonsense.
all right. all right. now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
hm hmm.
of course i'm happy for you. you've worked very hard for your success.
i just paid out twenty. i'd like to get it back.
i'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
terry?  what do you want?
if he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
what was her major?
<u>i'm</u> full of shit?  you're a monument of bullshit.  you even bullshitted yourself all i am, is taking out the garbage.  bad guys killing bad guys...
...well, i'm not sure where i --
you ain't going down there.  not alone. i'll go.
i...do you want me to leave?
oh come on, verbal. who do you think you're talking to? you really expect me to believe he retired? for a woman? bullshit. he was using her.
that's what i'm saying.  the old ways.  the old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  the...bruce, harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...i say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. i plat it out eight units.  eighty- two grand.  i tell them. "this is now.  this is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  this is it, harriett..."
is it dry?
prnceton.
you drink rum?
so you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
well, he has a straw hat--
clarence, i gotta hand it to ya. you were cooler than cool.
paula, he dored and nobody's seen him.
oh no, i can't do it.
elliot blitzer.
no, i'm here. where are you?
maybe something happened to them. maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
yes.
son of a bitch. get over here.
charlie?
yeah, i guess so.
one we're producing.
what about the record?
proms always make me sad. they're so final. graduation. everyone's scattering, moving on.
helluva game!
when i thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  it wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. it was something that i could never get away from... but now, i feel it's okay.  i feel good.
arrested on an assault charge five times...
you said you're gonna call me up. you didn't call me up.  who do you think you are?    who do you think you are...?
but father, i'm assistant editor.
that's true.... your soldier knew, didn't he?
shit, shit, shit...
you got thirty minutes.
why didn't you tell me sooner? i would have switched doctors!
nice to see you, lieutenant.
i gave it to him yesterday.
marcus!  i did it!
it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before... a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known...
ain't heard from ralph since last christmas. don't matter -- i've got a new crop.  i'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. i'm good for something in this old world and i know it, too! we know that she will rout the devil.
no, margo.  this is one problem you can't solve.  you have to stay out of it.  the fact is, i want to retire.
i thought i was supposed to stay in my room.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow i can still see.  look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do i have to --
ah ...
what?
ann--
beverly, there were many reasons why you and i...
i can't find that charm daddy gave me from india.
i don't want to erase anything.
not have it.
i don't know.
lonnegan's a fast egg, henry.  he's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
the document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form.  it's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
too early to tell. nervous?
well, that was plan a.
does my colleague's piece concern section forty of the bill--a dam on willet creek?
i'm not using him as an excuse.
my god...
you stop him?
i don't know, grady. i just dropped him on a corner.
women?
one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon, sir?
agnes, you're stupid.
oh, mr. denby, i wrote a poem about a bracelet--
no.
right now?
you're on leave, man.  you're on psycho leave.  i'm talking to a possible whacko here.
what's going on? let go of me! stewardess! i'll never fly this airline again!
i have a small window of time.
john, get out of the way!!
i switched apartments with her. she's in #17. just walk down that way. it's just to the right.
yes?
i'm chairman?
you don't understand.  this is my niece vera.
thanks, harry, really, but... i can't explain it. she's my mother. she's just... i can't give up on her that easy.
answer him, goddammit!!
whatever --  what'd you do to the charger?
yessir. i'm sorry.
after 12 years in the minor leagues, i don't tryout.  besides-- i don't believe in, quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
you don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
not too bad. i'll be here a few days longer.  i want to see you.
this is the unified field!  all the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
did to.
forty.
no.
sonofabitch!
what a bitch. you should see a doctor. that can be dangerous. george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room.
she came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
would you like me to change anything?
you don't know where your mother is? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
i could make her another cleopatra...
tonight?
no --
great. hey. that's great.
who was the last person you had sex with?
b-but... we saw... your neck...
what do you mean you can't?
true, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  we can keep him contained. it's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
ya got the car?
the one to town is, but that's about it. i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. i told him who you were and what had happened. he said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
yeah, well, he's from a third world country. he doesn't have it easy.
they'd put you in jail, eh? well, historically you'd be in very good company.  that's what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo. would you like to do a little raking?  work, i'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. on the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
'the last of the mohicans.' only book my father ever read.
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day. fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
hey mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... how do you like it so far?
what is that <i>thing</i>?
oh don't be, i'm here. it's alright. i want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
nicky, the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
i'm not going to get fucked like gribbs. he's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  i don't need that. i don't care who it is. i'm warning everybody. gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. that's not going to happen to me.  you understand?
yes. i like to watch.
the queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
i have to.
oh.
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  take my advice and make that bet.
man, is this interesting.
we have to!
jesus. what are you doin?
also identical?
...i’m emily stewart. the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. however i go about this that’s who i am. do you get what i’m fucking saying, mr lombard?
casharoonie!
well, you're married.
forget your tie, handsome ... frank!
why not?
i know, mom.
i can give you a lift home if you'd like?
oh, god!
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
going somewhere?
hey, doolittle, here's one. an unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
that's one dollar an' twenty cents.
shit...
but, andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
how deep is he?
what for -- ?
well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave grubbel a job watering their lawns. isn't that wonderful? and then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
wow just like marco polo.
let's get the kid home.
i don't know the last time i've been out of the city... hey, my arms are tanning. i used to tan great. we gotta stop soon so'se i can check on spencer.
sex?
don't say that, we can do it somehow. it might not be perfect, but --
not just every six weeks.
laying in supplies, mrs. peel weather may get very nasty and i've no umbrella ...
like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. anything i can think of.
what about that waitress at the ambassador?
i'm okay. i just -  you just have to understand. i've been with lester since i was a kid. i just wanted to say goodbye. i - i just...  i don't... i think i have a right to do that. okay?
okay, take it off, take it off.
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
you really do hear a lot, don't you?
i've heard good things about their london branch.  you have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
and so i... i prefer my banner.
oh!
so caesar, what did it total out at?
diane!  alright, let's stop this right now.  let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  this isn't even smart thinking.
i don't like this place, mom. it's creepy. please can we go? i promise i won't make any more bad pictures!
yes.
what happened to your face?
who are you?
what about now?
that macho pompous english --
mr. president, how the hell did you get on board?
sir -- our shields are dropping!
i'm duff.
osgood proposed to me.  we're planning a june wedding.
then how did you get here?
now, just have a little patience, my boy.  your birthday isn't until next week.
and another thing.  stop with this spaceman thing.  it's getting on my nerves.
it's a bad idea.
mark. what happened to your date?
can i be anyone i want?
that's a crock! if one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
i'll send you straight to hell, fuck!
-- stephen, this is bullshit --
listen, jim -- and if you wisecrack while i'm talking i'll crown you with the inkwell.
something's not right...
i got word from wynant this morning...
are you sure?
well which of those three ya want fixed?
a date... coffee... a drink...a walk in the park.
i'm not even a field person.
just the same.
all right, gwen, alex, fred, follow me.  guy, set up the perimeter. tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
what is it? what happened?
i'll just say that we had a great night together.
jimmy, you've got --
why then, sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
what do you mean, ‘no’, mrs de moraes?
but what if something happens to you?
on the beery picture! where are we? wuddya got?
you were right.  i didn't find anything.  i'm going to run and get something to eat. are you hungry?
i'm starving.   there's got to be something open around here.
because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. but i think this goes deeper than that.
you're such a kidder. i have a big surprise for you. but first there's something you must do.
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business.
seven terraces of purgation.
we should slow down.
prettier than ann?
well, then let's climb abroad.
we're going to make it back, grant. three or four times over.
darcy?
ready?
it is also a place of burial.
what happened?
so how's your work?
do you trust him?
what if the japanese did invade?
so beautiful, irena. so beautiful.
no. it's for a lot of other things, too.
darling!...you will be careful!?
is the dead guy in there?
...here's to child abuse!
about me?  how sweet.
what a i going to do for the rest of my life? i don't have a boyfriend anymore.
i didn't.
i'm committed to nuke for the season.  you had your chance the other night.
where are you going?
ouch!  that really hurt!
are you gonna kill him?
i need my paycheck.
some cream?
how much we got?
is that a fact?
ok, don't panic; let's think about this.
the point is this -- i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?
just a minute, mrs. lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. who's adam?
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach.
congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition, doctor.
you're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
i don't care for him.
they recruited me when i was in high school.
he's not showing it until it's down.  but it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  you and robert got great ratings today. which is the first thing we needed to know.
what did i tell you?
you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  teddy was furious when he found out i'd taken tranquilizers!
do you think i should go?
--whatever you want, no problem--
he's perfect! a baseball player. what could be more american!
i'm talkin' his spiritual mother. maisy blue legs.
i don't believe it. wild horses wouldn't drag dickie to --
it is now.
he takes off and i gotta go to kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
danny!  danny, where are you?!
coney island??
'kay, place your bets.
what!?
yes, i know.
have you ever been there before?
why? why's anything happen? it's all money, man. money. the girl just got in the way.
and what happened then, mrs. rand?
what's the decoy?
it's clear.
i thought you guys were going to call me.
saved you last night's, too.
oh come off it, mare. what about what's-his-name... steverino? you could've at least passed the baton on that one.
yes?
i can only stay for one drink, ben. i've got to meet with victor.
by the way, laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? you know, just before he disappeared?
did you just have a brain-fart?
not all think it is the horseman. many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer, offering death as tribute.  and, still others believe none of it.
i'm home now.
you won't have long to wait. in just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. off with you now, amy. go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
a fucking wheelchair?
why not? they're my favorite.
it's been a while since you read the news -- i'll have somebody work with you.  just on superficial performance things.
pino, i work hard like everybody in here.
it's me... elizabeth.
this monster escaped from cryo- prison this morning.
what else, stupid! you don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  ten thousand bucks? chicken feed! we're holding her for a million smackers.
nothing. nothing much. passing through.
sign here please.
guys, he's right behind us!
yah.
the dark side. the price you pay for all the fun you're having. you knew about it, of course. didn't you?
well?
why would you let me go back?
hey look!  it's buzz!
okay.  these are good.
i'm going to kiss you, mister o'connell.
where are you from?
you think they're watching?
well yeah. of course. everyone kisses.
wade's got a point there. i'll handle the call if you want, jerry.
her life is in your hands.
where's that?
go then. i can't let you put it in me now but i want you. i like you.
why should i call the police, huh? they don't so any good.
no one's dying on my watch, smith! what about the reserve tanks?
tuna, this is crap.
me?  i was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  but where else could a red-blooded american boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the all-highs?  besides, now i'm trying to pay my penance.
only about a thousand times. what do i do now? "what's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
'night, jim.
would you marry me if i was?
suspect zero.
yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you i'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. it stands to reason, i won't have it.
nice club, mr. gekko...
you've kept up your end of the bargain, i'll do the same. but you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
now. you say the driveway's on your side of the house. so i guess you don't sleep in the same room.
i have to go back. or it'll never stop.
don't make it difficult for me. this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
... as they head up for the show. oh yes, well i mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
thanks. i'll phone hildy right away to get that story.
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  he's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  he's probably planning it right now.
check your gun before you leave. they're not allowed in japan.  it's a nice, safe country.
what...! --
got sanchez... world war three wouldn't mess with this fucker... can go through walls... and it's like all over the place...
no shit. i got no problem with that.
thank you for your gift. i'm sorry about marie.
all right, johnnie, you want to play it this way, i can play it this way. you want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
intuition.
that's pretty good.
you can talk to me.
what deal?
i guess i'll see you around the orchards. thanks for everything.
...quarrel?
a horse?
yes.  dr. h. delbruck.
you live a fabulous life, robin.
what part of 'off the record' don't you understand?
how 'bout i come next sunday and watch the super bowl with you?
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
like i said, i'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
we used pull.
my plan is just beginning.  i'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but i'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses!
come in, please. come in. can i get you a cup of tea?
what's up?
is it?
it is. it's very warm. i wonder how long it will last?
it's very possible ordell's killed somebody.
i thought michael was picking me up.
...a lieutenant james dunbar?
when he was alive. i wouldn't fuck him now.
three years.  how long have we been in business?  three years.  does she get to meet your connection?  was she good enough?
okay?
scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. and bob. remember:
who, can you think, who would want to harm dr. fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
<u>who</u> are these guys...?
you... you remember eagle hendershot?
no, sir, no.  if you ask me, i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
he's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6.
okay that hurt.
so you might be working for uncle sam.
yes, urm, she's right. i have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
i thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
caesar's mafia, isn't he?
looks like ya gonna take office just in time, chief.  things need straightening up in this city.
what doing?
we could skip the gavotte.
yeah. one minute you're studying great expectations and the next minute you're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
kim and i are close friends!
i don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  not while i'm holding this.
-- can't mr. dowd find his own expert witness, your honor?
we left them eighty-eights.
a twist ending if you will.
the invasion plans.
i guess that answers your questions. there's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... what a waste...
you're going alone?
i can't believe i remembered that, although i suppose i should. i wrote it...  but that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. i'm flattered... i think. or frightened. what's your name?
finally you got a bitch, huh, roach?
did you settle things with mr. diebold?
you think i'm all talk, eddie?
we gotta roll, stevie...
who do you think changed the parade route?
so you've grasped the idea.  con- gratulations.  now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.
i didn't need to know that a man i'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
help him!! promise me you'll help him!
keep away, i'm fine, i'm fine.
we'll stop for just a moment. then we'll do the lacrimosa.
but nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
'cause i just don't buy it. call it instinct. call it 35 years of professional know-how...
we're drunk.
i hear six.
frankie!
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
how about letting the people out of the bank.  why put them in this position?
if you say so, henry. but remember my claustrophobia.
only to the naked eye.  those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. but the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. an ocean of life...
is there an ashtray in here?
yeah, i'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
gus, do you know what i want now? i want coffee!
souvenirs?  no, wrong answer. looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
and three weeks.
we're within range, sir.
well i have to come up with – an outline, i'd guess you call it. the story. the whole goddamn story. soup to nuts. three acts. the whole goddamn-
no sign of the snowman.
who is it?
yes, baron.
please, god.  let this be it.
so do i. so what? i'm doing all right.
lady, i can't. i can't. i ca-
shoes?
it's complicated... i guess i'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
aha.
i don't know, ma'am.  he was observed earlier, i believe.
in the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
well... i might be going out to dinner.
don't give me any of your shit!  okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
what do you want, kit?
don't you bave a car?
i don't believe in reincarnation.  so i won't see you in the next world.
i think i'm going to throw up.
yes, kip. short for kipling. named for the english writer of stories about india ... he bites into his pear ... memphis says nothing, waits ...
i've no money.
well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
these scars.  how did you get them?
captain spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
you're in a rush.
it's nothing.
where's ... what's-his-name -- fred --
nah, man...
your kid's in the back here. he's crying.
you've done well, scottie. you're good at your job.
babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. and because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. like, perpetual darkness.
where are you taking her?
hey big harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
you might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
don't tell me it's not the gas!  your mother thought she smelled gas.
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to florida next month... west coast, near tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
see those guys?
he's been repeating that since birdson's exorcism.  i looked in every passage in the bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
you were a beautiful baby. so calm.
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive.
the joint's not open, mac.  who's brandon?
the wind isn't blowing.
i said play!
very well. as soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
you’re wrong about my being there, though. carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  leon saw it, like you, assumed i was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. but carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. he watched it, confronted carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... i don’t know how he knew about the hotel. perhaps carlos talked too much... my husband did not tell me... you more or less guessed the rest...  i didn’t know any of this before you left for los angeles.
what do you expect, mugging me from behind?
that's because he knew.  he'd seen these files and knew.
for once i'm glad you're rumor central.  what in the world is going on?
see that, col?
oh, i was going to discover the secret of the universe.  that's why i liked nix.  he promised me all these explanations.
no rain.
come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
i'm curious how you did this with such economy.
what are you putting that crap on me for?
'the heir to the fortune must wear the mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  we should all have to suffer such burdens.
a kiss for each page.
...you know, for kids! which is perfect for hudsucker -- not that i claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case i'd say it's at least twice that, but i gotta tell ya, mr. mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
i guess so.
you've kicked over the whole city hall like an apple-cart. you've got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall. you've put one administration out and another in. this isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! and you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! still a doll-faced mugg! that's all you are.
we still talk, though.
about that chest-cutter...
that i wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. at least you'll know i've been telling the truth.
they dig for the gems to support our cause. they also search for the last two stones. soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful!
no, it's a good thing. i like it. everything about you is great. i like how you don't shave your legs. women are so much sexier when they're natural.
what do you want, paula? what do you really want?
yup.  that's him goin'.  i love to watch him go.
let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  how's kevin?
which stall?
ignore it.
the attic room is locked --
i've never been in a place like this before.
it's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. but that's not important right now. the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. do you know anything about planes?
- and that copy of the "enquirer" said the president should be killed.
i take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
wow!  what was that all about?
so where is the lamb?
well, i mean it's not a total loss.  it is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
asshole that does not count as a kill.
hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
let me know if i can help, alan. you’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. anything, anytime.
i'm not afraid of the dark.
are you sure?  jack -- this is not something you have to do.
it ain't your locker no more.
please calm yourself. you'll soon be well if you do.
wha...what do you mean? we have a date every night.
now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
... all right.
where?
cheraw falls.
buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
jittery is the word.
that's all we know about.  most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. a suck mark. these don't. so, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  you could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. i know that's pretty thin...  he bites a lot.
now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
just what is it you think i can do for you?
yeah, what is it?
jeff you have company!
well, son, i wish i could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
funny you should say that. my grandfather was a peach farmer.
the plane went down.  my friends died.  i washed up on an island.  then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.
i beg your pardon?
how?
but boss, what about their parents?
you're drunk.
yes.  i do.
do they come in dreams, these visions?
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial.
well, that's interesting, dave. i always liked washington, it's a pretty town.
no. it's, uh... no, i really don't think it's a good idea
they're impossible!!  jesus!  i mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton"??!  who is this tony clifton?!
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
damn.  it's so...fresh.
rose rose?
it was the plo.
they're outside the beaming shield. mr. scott, start your engines.
you shouldn't monkey with him.
naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
i don't know how you died. the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
so young, so unlined, so full of promise.  so innocent.
we're doing this together. we're partners.
go ahead, shoot... shoot and kill the bitch, i don't care.  and yet you don't shoot.  interesting. put down your weapon and walk away.
ten bucks apiece.
a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
no, they want you, mr. president.  i really think it would be a good move.
we can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, edgar.  they're stealing papers right out of his office.
what do i do with it?  nothing.  it's for peace of mind.  it's for the principle.
she can't remember.
whew!  a nineteen-inch drill.
beaver?  you mean vagina?--i mean, you know him?
yeah.
well, stay away from them.  don't get close.
i'm sure of this. but not of you.  you won't open any joint. i've been watching you change. you're mad now and you think you can change back. but you can't. you'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
however, with injuries such as this, i have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
i hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. i think i'm getting the fear.
no one?
and you want a --
you have the most architectural skull.  and your nose.  very expressive.
what kind?
c'mon, luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
yeah? must be danny-boy. i lost him in the last race.
victor.
it's so strong!  look at its nose.  need help?
what about it?
and, i'm unemployed. so i have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so i left them a message this morning. their expanded confidentiality agreement? i will sign it.
mmmmmmmmmhm....  now, jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
she didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to winston-salem. it didn't last that girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  a kike. that's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name i got. wouldn't you know it, rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? she was always out of her friggin' head and i'll tell you why.  buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. she was a nymphomaniac.
it is  jon.  twenty-four years ago.  before he turned into dr. manhattan.
every guy has a type!
i think that'll hold it.  hello shirley. just helping someone tie up a christmas present. how are you?
that tip not work-out for you fellas?
drink?
not the way you’re thinking. the women wanted me there for support. you can understand that.
what's this?
sick of the sight of it!  well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? i was just about...
well, it's a disaster. i don't know what to say, doctor, i am floored. how dangerous is the operation?
i've come up against fanatics before, and duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  i'm going out there, skipper. maybe i can be of some help...
no, i didn't...
trust me, it's her!
now what?
i love people. all people. even people that no one else loves, i think they're ok, you know. like beggars.
you show them crawfords how to play ball.
god, can you hear me!
he paid the hospital bill when you were born. your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
no, jeff.  you don't.  he's not a murderer, i tell you.  he;s not a murderer.
listen, sonny ... can i call you sonny for short?
ah ... er ... it looks as if you're taking me.
well, i'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here.
but still, you can't say cbs wouldn't love to break something like --
we're going down.  all of us....
<i>new york times</i>...?
looka, sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
clothes.
we've got a situation here! just do as  you're told!
you're too late, toby.  we're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
feeling better?
no.
where... where am i?
he was a great boy for that. what else?
he's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
and what do you suggest i do about it, dear boy?
i hope you got your money.
do we even get our same bunks back?
shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, you just shut the fuck up.
what do you mean?
who did you work with to get the--
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
well, i thought i'd check if all of you were still here.  i'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
this thing works. we could go home right now.
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
no -- we don't want this case in court.
i'm colonel blake. you fellows just passing through?
nice looking kid. going to be okay?
nope.
don't shoot me, i'm just the piano players.
it was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. there was no-one around when i finished my bath, so i started. i hope that's alright, sir.
it made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  and i got more depressed than ever; i saw i'd never get the operation.  so i tried to take my life - i swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. but i just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'wow!'  so when i hear he's in the bank, i almost go crazy because i know he's doin' it for me.
okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' mallory? i know she's still here, and i know you know where. so, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
you don't know many of citizen barras' friends, do you?
mr. cole?  my name is doctor railly. i'm a psychiatrist.  i work for the county -- i don't work for the police. my only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
oh. that's a relief.
is there a young tim?
you must go to the dagobah system ... there you will learn from one who taught me:  yoda, the jedi master.
try the fort laramie treaty. all over again.
you don't say?
they ain't men, mae rose. they're convicts. and nigger convicts to boot. can you say nigger?
i'm keeping it in trust.
that was just loose talk.  i don't want anybody dead.
i should shit or get off the pot.
i'm so glad you could come, mr.--
all day again?
i guess.
you've never been alone and you can't be alone --
people phoned in.
when you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
if you're possessed, you can't reveal anything satan wants hidden.  unless you trick him.
he ain't here right now.
that.
how are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
you want to hit?  yo, claude. give can't get right a shot.
did they give him special care?
y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... y'had us for that. y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, i'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  so if you think i'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt i've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking mind!
unconscious. you know, when you don't know anything. your natural state. there are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, i happen to be one of those guys.
agnes, how did your mother get you?
i suppose you want a tip?
we blacked our hands and faces.  at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  the name of the village was mhravitch. remember that name!
oh, it is?
nice room. balcony and everything. lovely view too.
will.
vada, we're trying to work here.
but now you don't have to--
you heard me that time.
i got a picture here. i want you to tell me where to find this woman. i been asking everybody. nobody knows anything.
no.  i don't work here.
let's get ahold a' her quick.
don't be such a fucking smart ass.
what?
but what?
it's good to be king, hey charles?
and how long will you be away?
it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it's romance.
and now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
what's the point with hooks and lines? --
what an honor...
john doesn't have sex with ann anymore.
spare me your classical answer. measurements in.  results taken.  what if i didn't miss?
they're both a challenge.
why was i assigned to you? to debunk your work. to reign you in. to shut you down.
not yet.
no thanks. i'm afraid i wouldn't be able to give ozzy the focus he deserves.
i don't know. relationships seem too distracting. i'd rather concentrate on my studies.
and if i told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
mr. smith? oh, you mean ann schuyler's husband?
don't you use olives?
not koontz.
actually, yeah, she was nervous about gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  you know women, mick.
you don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! did you see his *face*--?
best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
yes...
we got the digits, baby.
perhaps she wasn't feeling well... maybe a cramp or something...
i have to go.
pitiful rookerful...
you don't seem all that scared.
you think i'm just one of those italian casanovas.  the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  who prey on unhappily married women.  who lure unsuspecting--
i'm going back to the lodge, ellie. still need to go through some of kay connell's school records.
...no....
sure thing, please don't worry about me. can i help you with the dishes?
give him a cup of tea.
<u>barbara</u>?!!
and did they?
no, not yet. i tried to work on it a little last night, but i'm having trouble concentrating.
in a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
i hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, mr. cluett.
mmm.
what is it?
train goes at four minutes past twelve. you've just got time.
you think sandmen will?  there's no other way for me,
why shouldn't be close it? he went away.
it's not what you think.
you'll soon find out, you liar!
listen, got a question for you.  do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
you've heard beethoven before?
i really love you.
strange... i can feel my old self coming back...
...just want to get back to the beans...
maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach.
why on earth should you be so depressed?  have you heard some of the things they've been saying? you can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
like after you've killed ... every ... last ... one ... of norrington's men.
come on, joe.
we'll find him.
i'm happy.
mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
how's this a plan? how're we gonna get a car?
he says they turned the card down.
but at the first sign of trouble, i'm going to deactivate it. agreed?
i ain't sure i know that. baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. and how'd she make it and her husband didn't? and where is he? and how she have that baby in the woods by herself? said a whitewoman help her. shoot. you believe that? well, i know what kind of white that was.
whyn't you learn your lines?
no.  well, her grandparents are down in oklahoma, but that's it...
look, i knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. but that don't mean you get any slack. swayzak sends you down here, okay, i gotta eat you, that's the rules and i got nothing to say about that. but swayzak or no, you live with me. step out of line, and i don't care who knows you, i'll swing the hammer.  you think you're the first?
down to your heart. i'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
if i die, you'll know where to look for me?
why so few?
i don't know--let's break some windows.
what about it?
it's still a good plan.  it's just... got a twist.
boy, the nuts are out tonight. what'd that creep call you - ?
maybe another job is the best thing.
would you care for a drink while you're waiting? i can put it on the underhill bill.
satellites.
but irena is in the garden. she's right there, under the tree.
a little. not much.
that ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
you know what i want, miz lampert...
i know your work well, signore. do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
yes...
here we are! i'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
maybe you should take that coffee outside.
it's just... y'know... i mean...
goodnight, mrs. pilletti.
you're in here for winging a guy?
not that truth!
do you have something better to talk about ?
no —— not yet.
sure, but i'd like to handle it.
i don't know! i just said that!
what things?
probably mister riddle.
i thought a torn acl was ten to twelve.
how d'you mean?
why are you trying to hurt me?
so do i.
it looks intact.
i gotta believe. out!  now they're rollin'.  king-five-four gets an eight.  pair'a nines with a jack gets a four. ninas still up.
great! go back to your files. bye.
too late for what, sheila?
you just took a shot at me, asshole. i think you do know where he is.
so you <u>are</u> a man after all.
then how come you're not with him?

fourteen year old girls.
colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  there must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
luther, say again.
fascinating animals, fascinating.
oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
just give me a hand.

thank you.
you're from la, right?
the day walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? for lamagra's return. one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a tide of blood."
i don't know.  at a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  my central nervous system was telling me something. jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so i could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what i like to do anyway.  and i'm chipper because you finally showed up.  i thought i'd cook for us. tequila and eggs sound good?
you know who?
i don't have time for all this shit!  just handle it, bob!  keep it out of the white house.  what else? kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if i don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
she's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
you are with me, zozo, don't worry.

it worked!
bleeker told me katrina's whole house reeks of soup!

she likes you.
you don't like him, do you?
we're almost there.
there's a man downstairs.  he brought us eggs.  he might stay.
yeah.
like i'd marry you! you would be the meanest wife of all time. and anyway, i know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv. the blair witch project was on starz, and you were like, "oh, i want to watch this, but we should make out instead. la la la."

yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.

you don't believe in the paranormal.
i'm a scientist.  i have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if i were you, i'd give it to him.

that's why you're so perfect.  you have something i don't have.
no. i told you, she's confined...
that girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
--i'm sure--
which one, the big tab or the little tab?
you're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
since what?? did you have a fire at your house or something?
i thank you.
did you solve your problems?
it's perfectly normal for a child to dream. i can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. that image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
i'd have to say my spine was broken, keyser.
someone must have got a shot off. he wasn't exactly a moving target.
and what exactly do they intend to do?
i was getting hot dogs. what do you mean?

congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
no one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
eeuww.
i forgot what real coffee tastes like...
no.  i have children, grandchildren too.  i visit when i can.  but now that mr. jimmy cannot be left very long, i do not get away much.  poor mr. jimmy.  there is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  very sad.
-- is that what this is all about?
i am a princess.  you have no right to order me about.

a load, if i may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
i'm candy...

how much farther?
no, i don't, i uh... it got burned up. everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. all i got left is what i have on...
the message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  it's smart.  it's approaching us in a simple way.  like you would a dog.  holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
why not? he's a thief--he's a criminal.
oh, lord, chance - i don't know what i was expectin' from you... i'm sorry for yellin' like i did... no sir, i just don't know what i was expectin' ...  ... i 'spose i'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
yeah, but it was shot.
you know what really excites me about you?
of course not. who wants to? what’s the point if we don’t get caught? where’s the glamour in that?
what dya mean, don't worry about it. of course i'm gonna worry about it, i can't fuckin' see.
you didn't step on any mine.
you have very nice ceilings.

you didn't find anything.
yeah yeah yeah - look!  i've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! lou goes to turn walter against the wall but walter springs back -

what is it?  your legs?  hands?
listen, bren-duhhh, i think you're the one overstepping boundaries. you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. besides, who cares if he's married? i can have friends who are married.
--and why does he hang out with his friends? because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. it's called loyalty!
nah, don't say anything. i'm alright.

the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?

instant divorce you mean?
he'll destroy us.

your brother, huh?
isn't this just typical!  we finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
of course not. he wouldn't be.
how dare you...  you don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, mr lombard?
ok, let's relax. i'll check it, maybe i'm wrong. don't everybody freak out just yet.
you should write something about this.

just hangin' out.
you don't have to lose your temper!  that's what you told me the last time too. every time i step in to protect you. at the elk's dance[7] when that big swede made a pass at you—

your daughter's life was just threatened!
first bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
do you love me rachel?
i think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
i'm sure you do.
are you sure you're okay?
it's incredible who's here.
say, what happened to your hand?
please don't go.
he wanted a watch, too.
...i'm sorry.
goodbye.
unwelcome.

you've been my best friend for years and i didn't even know you were out there.
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing?
i wanna walk.

what kind of person do you have to be to do this?
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
the detectives got matt up there in sampson's office.
no.  thanks.  absolutely.
leave him alone. she's his mother, not yours.
i just talked to him.

it's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.

<i>where</i> in fiji?  what island?
so now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  people watching you all the time.  waiting for you to make...  a slip.  slip up.
something else. do most attacks go unreported?
funny, i don't get that feeling. maybe it's because you found out i'm bill parrish's daughter.
um...i've got to run. i've bee doing this all day.  are you going to be all right?
you don't remember? or you never knew.
oh, by the way, i think you oughta know -- lorna thinks she's got the clap.
i see you're playing your radio, major. isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
what do you do?
no, no... don't say that. bad word.

cora, i adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in england...  i am certain of that. more than ever before.  i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
you wouldn't be here otherwise.
i don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  this used to be the main highway.  want to register, please?
i think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
got a moment, inspector?
-- understand what you're asking for here. the massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. no one can profit from the marriage. the pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
she's a lesbian.
tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. i'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  two hundred dollars a night, for what?
we'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
is your family in the apple business, too?
well, what do you want me to do? stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that willet creek dam appropriation around my neck. either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or i'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.

i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  you know who's behind this, don't you -- it's teddy kennedy! he drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? are you alright?
i wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
it was almost worth the trip--to find out that jesus christ in heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  i like his sense of humor, though--you know? he's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  you know what it says on the back? "pontius pilate athletic club." most people don't get it.  most people think there really is a pontius pilate athletic club.
it's already been a hell of a night. where you been?
i should have known.  i came into the house when you were down on the beach.  she looked at me so strangely.  she left right after you.  i shouldn't have let her watch us. she wanted to watch me all the time.  she tried to kill you, didn't she?
you killed domini, didn't you, witch??
don't you know?
i thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?

is marty here?
we're waiting on you.
what the hell did you do that for? what are you doing here?
-- i'm moving to washington.
yeah, sorry about that.  i had this meeting with this guy.
we have to think this through.  we have to be smart.  now is not the time to panic.  if we panic now, we're done for.  nobody saw it. nobody knows it was us.  we're still okay.  now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
really? that's where we're from.
are you gonna lock the store?
take the boss loading, kid. for god's sake. i don't want to hurt you.
still missing. we're looking.
i couldn't make you see how i felt, charlie.  i just couldn't -  i couldn't go threw with singing again. you don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  that if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... they don't want you.  they just 0

you can't keep me here.
moonby what?
thorbjorn vifilsson's wife became a buddhist, not a christian.

nigger, get real. you touch jayne kennedy she'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -
hold me, don.
you're like an undercover guy!
what list?
how's zander?
honk at him. scare him.
we'll pack up everything and send it to you.
...that's right...
to prevent a murder.  sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
you get rid of her.
well, we blew it, didn't we?  he ain't wrong.
then, after the first number, i tell the one about the scotchman trying to open a pullman window--the scotchman says to the window--"gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"you loosen up a bit and so will i."--good?--and then i do the one--  oh--you don't like it, eh?
and i just want to know if i'm crazy or not -- if what i think is happening is actually happening.  or am i one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
yes, i remember. what do you do when these moods overtake you?
i'm okay. it's going well!
where is it?
a moray eel...a moray eel....
he has his homework to keep him occupied.
steve...
what <u>was</u> that thing?
i don't speak spanish.  all i need is to get back... just enough for that.

that's what my report will read.

he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  i contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
sir, we stay with the president.
oh, man.  that's no glitch!
nicky!
why, that's an echo, sir!
i don't know...
thank you very much.
that your cousin is more to your taste.
but you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  i promised we'd take judy to f.a.o. schwarz.
hey! we came over to help you with math homework!
thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  i will be back. an hour, tops.
uh, no, i didn't know that, brad.
yes.
captain miller, we're ready to repressurize the clark.
there.
and where is joseph?
it was the best time of his life.
that depends on who "they" were.
if she knew, she'd kill me. it happened at your house last night.
i'm just a messenger.
but what'd she actually do?
...bed.
no, it isn't. i'm hungry and—and scared.
is that kid still bothering you?
you better watch yourself. there's a lot of heat on you already.
and i bet i've kept that promise ...
well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
one moment, please...  i'm afraid, i have no one by that name registered, sir.
monsieur andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
did you tell alice?
... that's great.
me too, oh, i tried to convince myself, believe me, "it's like being married to a doctor," i said. doctors are practically never at home. the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? or are you too selfish . . . "
that doesn't bother you, does it?
what? that made her lose the baby?
i gotta get back to cushman.
i never imagined i'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  it's over, isn't it?
searching for a money man...
how far is amarillo?
does he ever mention me?
"well, jim," i says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
for what makes the world go round. for money, and for glory.
never was anybody like you...
and you can't?
oh no, my dear.  you look absolutely amazing.  there's no way i can compete with you.  the scene is yours.
look at me, think of me as cash! this offer is really real!  from a rich man in new york city who only saw a photograph!
how often do you see them?
you broke last time.
you remember what i said about the vitamins.
hey...  i can't control it.  it's just, something that happened.
who did this?
linda king's desk.
do you know where you are, fran?
visualize a spare?
range is two kay.
aren't you?
thank you, chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
basically the same thing. in a very evolved, esoteric way.
you guys'll be using teddy's old space, is that okay?
free?
that's wonderful!
some kind of circuitry...?
yeah, wasn't i?
is this true, stewart? did you really say it?
not a floater.  only just dead.
we were in the nick of time.  you were in great peril.
cypher?
like it?  it's a masterpiece.  i've never seen anything like it before... and i hope i never see anything like it again. walter smiles and looks at his creation -
you don't believe in god anymore.
ctu?  jesus.  you don't think --
okay...  night, baby.
got us a motel out highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? silk damn sheets. lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything i want to do. remember when she wrote that? anything i want...
take me back, put me to bed; i surrender. we've done enough damage tonight.
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who's been through a terrible orde--
i had... one moment, i had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
what'd you wish, george?
well brian, i guess you can say it's arson now...
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald, the beast of yugoslavia, hand to hand.
it can't be.
his whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
you're leaving?
you think i'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  that's ezio pinza you're thinking about.  the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. he won't stop.
get out of here.
no, i guess not.
hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  and assuming what you say is true..
it's happened before, you know! some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
why not?
i agree.
give your father the benefit of the doubt.  talk to him.  let him see who you are.
i'm still here.
why not?
protest to my superiors if you like.
why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
it's not the press that matters. nixon's wife is proud of him.
of course just like that.  that's how you always know when it's right.
from the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  it will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. ring him up, he'll look after you.
thank you, mom! thanks, dad!
...i thought you said you were a writer.
he doesn't need my help.
oh yeah?  me, too.
we know that...
and how does one go about getting these human documents, may i inquire?
oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those gibsons man. you know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
i could take you downtown.
duggar called him?
sigurd's sword...
i've only read about them -- and the new internals.
still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
the guy was a total fruitcake.
well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
so. how are you adjusting?
who?
it wasn't deep enough. i told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
hey joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
keep her safe. no matter what. i'll deal with whatever's back there.
sure you do. he cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
listen up. i need directions. downtown. somebody named hershe.
my pocket.  check my pocket, will ya, honey?
do you think the police did a good job?
really. i want to know.
yeah--i see i'm right where i've been for seven years--
it'll be out later this year.
you mean mama rose was like mrs. holland?
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
excuse me, sir...
promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
or hemingway, when hadley lost all those stories.
hi.  is frank there?
that's smart.  let's talk about guns and violence.
you have to know what you're talking about.
what?! why would you call me a pigfucker?!
no, what's wrong?
got one. just pulled up.
i won't let you down, professor carter.
no prints.
your medication. they're placebos. just pills made out of water.
puerto rican rum. see for yourself.
give the word, admiral.
i ordered no interruptions.
you're exactly right, andy. i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm. and now i'm counting on your assistance too.
going on twenty years now.
what do you mean?
actually. i've been in twice.
ok!
i don't need camels.
i stay here because i am happy.  is that such a terrible crime?
but in the latin alphabet, "jehovah" begins with an "i".
there they are!
i don't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things. my room is right above my father's office. the ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. that's direct from the coroner's office. the person is unknown. there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on, but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. i heard some of the same names.
did you finish thinking?
how real does it seem?
what did you have to test, for god's sake... the dental don juan of detroit?
...adenoids.
very becoming. it looks better on you than it did on me.
shhh... remember this is a privilege, so i don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. kay?
you a good pool player.
she still with kent?
what do you know? you wouldn't know the first thing about writing. you're the most ignorant person i've ever met!
this is your most lucky day.  my family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
no thanks.
sure.
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
well...i don't know.
i miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
why are we speaking chinese?
i got that boy coming over here.  what's so funny?
i found it out a little late. i'm worth more dead than alive.
this is dangerous. i'm sending backup.
do you live here? with seagrave?
i'll catch up with you.
i'm the king of the world.
what are you going to do?
sir... i believe you have only two barrels.
you should watch what you say.
now we're on the right track... put back "dear"... how does it read?
come on.
ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? i mean... look, you're so drunk. i like you. i trust you.
gone?... where?
pardon me, but i doubt you can handle her.  my wife was quite a martial arts expert.  jade fox killed her.  so you see, this is personal.  leave her to me.
well, i'm here now. i'd like to do something...
diane.
you want i set up?
are you all set?
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me.
no.
four...
what're you talkin' about?
you're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
well, bye, bye now. we have to go.
do not try your trickery on me!
who is it you wish to see, sir?
ed, what was the one thing i asked you to do?  make it <u>seven reels long</u>. i've got contracts with my exhibitors.  if it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
marcus -- i've seen this window before.
i still can't believe caitlin's getting married.
you have to remember that i love you, that's all that matters --
that's right, dave, i'm headed for glenville on a whisperin' jet.
mom and i got plans.
you quit drinking?
again?
i walked in on my parents one time. it was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in.
you have any idea when your father died? eladio?
okay!  okay, fuck it!  use the basement!  get off me!
heather, what is it?
just for the record, i understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
what are you looking for?
john hinkley.  the guy who shot reagan.  he only had two names.
i don't know why you boys are so good to me.
thank you for sharing that with me, joe.
boss, then i'm afraid i can't continue working with bill.
you're not gonna be there.
watch the first step.
yes?
ready are you?  what know you of ready?  i have trained jedi for 800 years.  my own counsel i'll keep on who is to be trained.
it's a start.
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? toast all the newlyweds.
new baby?
in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
we bought you.
'love will find out the way'.
well, it's a terrific yard, chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
i know where they're going.
i'm glad you guys came by... what's the occasion?
what the fuck do you want?
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off.
could we sail to venice?
tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
otherwise.  i trust you know the difference.  you're an intelligent woman, finished at nyu.
okay, chewie, it's now or never.
do i love you?
i keep my mouth pretty much shut, but i don't like hitting.
bet your ass you are. now i don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. you gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
maximum intensity. yeah. i can't wait to get out of here. i'm gonna write. i'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. push myself away from the dinner table and say 'no more jell—o for me, mom.'
lookit that, up already.
wait...don't leave me in here...
here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
soviet sb-9 nuclear torpedo. yield, one kiloton.
was there any trouble?
how?
well, yah, but he had a buddy there. he, uh -
wait!
what do you remember about the accident?
now just a minute!
but, here's the thing. he'll only talk to you. he doesn't want you to ask him anything. and you shouldn't stare at him.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
no.
i phoned but nobody answered. i wanted to tell you how sorry i am -- and to find out if there was anything i could do.
why do men and women usually see each other?
you hoto?
nice view, huh?
how many guys they have on you?
it won't get through the blockade.
i'm still okay.
what did you do, homey, palm it?
not a star-jumper.
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
walker and williams.
settle it yourself.  what have i got a lawyer for?
where've you been?
we have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. please don't, don't discuss...
your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
is it a nice warm room, sir?
i know that you're evil.
fuck you, garcetti. i been at this for almost a year. i've done everything you guys have asked of me.
having a problem with your eye there?
what can i do, old man, i'm dead, aren't i?
when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  we're breeding them for submission.  soon they will be fully domesticated.
what? what?
kegan!
we're better off by ourselves.
i'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, jud?
no!
i'll be blunt. i know you can take it.
i've been doing nothing i shouldn't, sir. the millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, i mean. deltoid pulls alex down on the bed.
why don't i want to do this?
do grable.
so how's tricks? sorry, occupational humor.
that was not my decision, i can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. in the meantime no one else must know those files exist. secure the building and i will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
there is nothing to worry about now.
what?
two, two-fifty.
it's clean.
well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
what about carter?
i know, ma. i'm a tryin'. if it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. but it *ain't* the law. they're workin' away at our spirits. they're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. they're workin' on our decency.
i'm so tired...
how long has she had the room?
we need to talk.
yeah.
eve is going to stay. the house will not be closed.
nick, have i been a good partner?
i'll have no more to do with it. i'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, dr. macfarlane.
<u>i</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>maine</u>.  that's ridiculous.
no, that's what i want to talk to the mayor about.  we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
come on, we got to get this up. he's coming.
my god, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
i don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. another gang i know - you'd love them. they're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. people who are worthwhile.
what were they hiding from?
how do you mean?
it's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
what's the matter? you on their team now? you think i'm the guy?
i can, but i don't.
she's got it.
buzz!  buzz, come back!
good year? well, between you and me, mr. carter, we're broke.
yes, well...
huh?
dear duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely... i wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. do you see?
i'll support you.
what?
i'm sorry gurney.
i told you about the pumpkin didn't i?
you can have this for ten cents.
what? fuck telegrams. i'm in trouble. you worthless bastard. i'll cripple your ass for this! all that shit in the car is yours! you understand that? when i finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
that's it, i'm broke.
what kind of chromium is it?
how long was i out?
where are you, anyway?
president?
forget your pager?
there's a man here to see you, sweetheart.
how long have you been setting up?
hey.
mr. president, let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh, who runs the center.
mr lombard?
wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.
i know it's a littler late for an apology.
well, let's hope it's all for the best.
let's try to be practical about this. the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. i'll remain here... because... well, i don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. anyway, i just don't feel like leaving.
i don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
hi, jennifer.
he's a killer, brian... he's fucking insane.
what?
hullo, bob. boys, this here is english bob.
i'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
i think we're lost.
bunny, is that stuff i left in the garage still there?
thanks, sweetheart.
i ain't blamin' her, ned, i ain't holdin' it against her.  she knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was... an' she won't allow how i've changed. she just don't know how i ain't like that no more.
you know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
she gotta be kiddin', right? vaporize the whole damn planet--?
really? what kind of exhibition is it?
it's really nice of you to help us.
call me.
oh, gosh.
do i know you from somewhere?
and what do you do -- now?
you gonna go get him?
they just brought in donny astricky. shot by a jacker ...
thank you.
you okay?
ann--
what are you doing here?
about a minute...?
i did it because because i'd never stopped thinking about you and if i didn't find you i knew my life would never be good again.
don't flee from yourself.  if you have a quality, let it define you.  cultivate it.  it is you.  by helping me, you will help yourse...
since armitage sold them a program on it. put them years ahead of the competition.
at least you knew about dr. judd.
pictures. your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
just a second -- he has to go.
did you handle the round, mr. wigand?
you won.
mother--
i want out of this marriage.
you all right?
should have at least gotten the map off of him.  blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
that thunder's sure somethin'.
no bleeding.
i think you need your balls reattached.
they're a bitch team... score! roenick!
what good'll it do?
... yeah, then, but...
well, let's just think about that for a moment. he's a successful lawyer up in new york city and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. eeny, meeny, miney, maynard.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
they changed franklin's portrait.
what?
ha!
that's right.  your meal ticket's flown the coop.  that blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
this city has had its share of disasters. well publicized ones. it was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. and there it stayed, as i waited and watched the news over the years...  and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  and just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
he did?
oh. right. won't you have a seat?
no, that's what makes you unemployed.
new information.
you were never that innocent sugarpie.
machines do not eat message.
good evening, lieutenant.
whatever.
explain that.
well, i'm happy to tell you i've got good news.  as i was telling drew, i've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
i'm third in my class.
--hours before--
not for the weekend.  for the summer.
'deal with manchester definitely off! "preysing, oh -- i'd never have thought it of you.
i don't know.  if it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  it was still searching for meaning...
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
who are you?
althea hasn't told you?
maybe you don't know. i know you though. you're jeffrey beaumont and i know where you live and i know ways to get you and i know ways to kill you.
hey, i got stuff to do. but i'll find you later, okay.
now that's one ugly dude.
you ever been in a hostage situation?
bobby -- have you a flashlight?
we'll get the paramedics...
so, i saw you put that book down your trousers.
you came on a bicycle?  no wonder it's so late.
...no treasure... i had two weeks left on my sentence...
oh, like that song...
because she's an innocent. she's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by god.
there's good news and bad news.
which would you choose?
i'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  i am not going to think about it.  generally speaking i think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
easier than learning how to be poor.  my father's family was wealthy. when i was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  and he took his money with him.
i have an idea for that.
so what have we got?
what happened?
i was told there was a real nice girl here named joanne. quite young.
yes!  yes!  the boy!  one boy!
you'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, i've got a quite bad opinion about you.  norman smiles.
yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
it may have been affected.
we closed.
so it looks like a burglary attempt. you catch me. i get the gun, and shoot you.
it's just like driving a car....
stupid yourself.
i want to go home.
oh, man.
huh?!!!
obviously, this can't last.  she's going to dump him.  viktor won't be able to take that.  he's too sensitive.  it'll destroy him.
what happened to emma will never go away.  it's part of you now and it always will be.  but you have to learn to live with it...
cool.
remind me why.
you don't look like a college girl.
part of the original structure. when it was still an asylum. guy who ran the place -- dr. vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." from some german cathedral a million years ago: "driving the demons from the mind."
he is...?
we got faith in you, nick mason.  you're our inside man.
well, people gotta get by somehow. that's the curse. the mines done it. all that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! everybody's got a mother. you don't rip up your mother. you don't rip up the earth and take everything out. it's like the cracker jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
goin' to see my kid.
... love ...
i don't know, sir. we just spoke a few minutes ago.
moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the manchester cotton company...
look.  it's some kind of letter.
fred duggar?
i don't even...what do you mean?  i don't even know what that means.
do me.
are you all right?!  anything broken?
...after the thirtieth...
yeah.
just like john.  he won't listen.
it is less.
rosalie, please, listen to me! you have to stop.
don't worry about me.  i'm like a cat.
that was way back...
you got me pretty fucking curious.
it's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset!
we can't wait.  no matter what sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill pop.  you have to get sollozzo now.
are you?
huh?
find my brother wilfred.  give him this.  i have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  only family can be trusted.
i've been trying to nail george's for years, but he's very careful. i'll just keep having children. i think i'm pregnant, by the way.
forget it.
yes, darlin', time will tell.
it's too late...she's a woman grown now...
tell you what.  how good's the rf scanner you used in the car?
and don't be walking off with any of that. you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
you hadda show up on a weekend.  this weekend.  wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
same old story.  not interested.
tell me about it.
why do you have to go?
you're right, a kid is dead, but mook, this isn't the time.
you got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
really? because --
can i take you to the airport?
oh. well i am.
ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. be romantic. write her another letter.
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas...
why you gotta say a thing like that.
"it's not like we're gonna sell out."
what's that you're saying?
i thought you were one of my friends.
i show, you give me the information?
where's your mom?
you got bank americard?
i had a bad heart.
a comedy! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about hollywood, she seemed so interested...
it doesn't look like it.
what year do you think it is?
resuscitation?
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. are you sure you don't want anything?
who the hell do you think you are?!
i got a name - sal boca, brooklyn.
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
what're you doing?
i did not go to high school.
oh, yeah. i got them thinking ordell's real nervous. they love thinking he's scared of them.
supposin' you met an elephant?
would'ya look at this babies? made 'em myself. holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
you knew her?
yes, captain?
hi.
what?
it won't even hold the one day, ronnie --
catch you back at the wall.
objection!
appreciate something.
let's take a carozza and look at the moon.
we can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
a through h is correct.
well, destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, i dare to coin.
no!  no!  she's alive!  we have to --
elaine, i don't want to have to take you in for questioning. you've got his car, you were the last to see him –
where you going?
yeah, i had a bad night.
blak out.  blak listed.  blak ball. need i say more.
go.
it is new, it is, isn't it, sire?
what you do is take vengeance! which is a sin against heaven!
yeah. get ahold of sooze?
how're ya fixed for ammunition?
i see.  you don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
that would be a no.
yeah?
how about a hippopotamus?
bree -- thanks -- i don't want to.
he certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
no, sir.
how long ago?
you're sure easy to talk to.  i wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and i came up to you -- i wonder what would happen.
what else. of course, what else? and what are you writing about for your thesis?
no, no.  wait.  you don't want me to jump.  you're going to jump.  i'm stuck back here until it's too late. wham -- over!
how long?
his grades are hurting, charlie.
uh, i'm brian mccaffrey. your new assistant.
es impossible.
you got a little girl?
what?
anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a special needs class.
do you?
what'd you come out here for?
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke.
you were thrilled to be interviewed.  were you "interviewed"?
it was before you started going out. we had lunch at that inn on the lake.
i was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
seriously, it's like we're being reborn. we really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
nobody really changes at summer camp. they merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  you can't be helped, wichita. i'm not sure you can be punished, either. but let's find out...
the switch.  hit the switch.
as large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  it's posed as a question. what am i?
jack, i was just trying to help.
what do you think's going to happen to us?
where's your back-up?
you know, i can't believe i did it. you think it'll work out?
that was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  i heard you were a hitter.
it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much i hate his guts.
you saw through me?
what are you doing here?
and as a father, i worry about him.  in medieval stories, agent myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
that's what i want -- a gaff rig.
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones.
she was at the four seasons last night, man. but you shouldn't worry about that.
not curtis.
oh yes! -- upstart!
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
st. joseph's.
c'mon.  i don't want any jones about this.
what are you so scared of?
because you can't. do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri-la? she's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
so. what then? you just detach sex from everything..
`why doesn't he come live with us?' because everything is here.
you're strapped into an implant chair, and i'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her.
mr. president, hunt wants more money. another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
do you think he loves you?
it's all my fault, i'm so sorry doug.
you don't think...
when?
the pied piper of hamelin. by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty...
i'm not here.
jack.
what about coffins?
i get my hostage first.  no one's turned loose until i say so.
i was supposed to take the children to new england next week.
you've been alone together?
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? damn, that's eerie.
i'm sorry to hear about that, sir. his face contorted in rage.
and his ears.
mom, we agreed. you can visit, but you're not allowed to mention michael.
hey, that's terrific.
don't worry.  we did the right thing with it.
you go out... with friends?
i don't understand it, lieutenant. it's not getting anything from 4th brigade... not even their transponder.
so?
hop in, marty, . we've got a long drive ahead of us.
excuse me. i have something i'd like to discuss with you.
"los angeles, upi: elijah muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the black muslim movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
yes. they give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. days are going by, senator. days--weeks. finally, they think it's quite a bill. it goes over to the house of representatives for debate and a vote. *but* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
and billy told you that he'll tell that to...
huh?!
what an incredible view !
earth to richie. don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that's your enemy, not your audience. your audience hasn't even been born yet. it's a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
what?
that would be jack goodman, the boy who was killed.
you mean...?
he's hiding, the son of a bitch, in florida.
well, what do you do?  do-do-do you talk to holly, or lee, or what?  do you, do you, do you phone them?
not in months. i don't even know why i bought the damn place.
no, you're the best and i don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
you're a regular einstein, aren't you?
we've come a long way since homecoming.
i'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
he is my brother.
is that how you answer the phone?

cut.
no, i want to keep my room, and get another one.
wade's in cryo-prison.
i'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.

it's clear you are, and it irks me.
write her out a receipt, paine. give her a receipt for these letters too.
what were you doing there?
i can't.  the voice man is coming to get me.
yeah. i think so. i just had to tell him some of what i knew. is friday still on?
i don't see how i can, and i can't prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
then come with me.
just listen to what miss gulch did to toto! she --
shh——— it's all right -— i'll be all right.
your aunt called me.
right.
how is it?
no time like the present.  the car will bring you.
we planned a trip for her. i was going to send her to bermuda.
you don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
what courthouse?
you do though. you look really... is that a wonderbra?
three ways, i figured.
then was it worth it?
i'm sorry, rob, that's, it's --
you're joking.
look at that.  a white rolls royce. that's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
it's not fair to you.  this whole --
we have never worked a gig together but i am a firm believer in preparation.  so let's go over this again step by step.
well, you obviously don't know me.
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --

we're still not where we're going.
i'm gonna marry mr. bixler.
you're looking well, jean-luc. rested.

what kind of job? i'm a housewife.
didn't you go to sleep at all, karl? you been sittin' there like that all night?
i've got plans!
got it, sir.  we gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
what are you doing here?
keys.
this simon.  did you sleep with him?
it's quite satifactory.
where you signed this?
no need. i'm self-diagnosed. i have severe nympholepsy...  and i'm a bed-wetter.
you're lying! you were after the evidence. who put you up to this -- the manager?
-- simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
where am i?
where is he?
yes, that's my name. who are you, young man? are you supposed to be here?
well, where was he?  where did he go?
it all started with our mission in istanbul.
nothing.
are you sure?
ready for what?  sight-seeing?
what evidence? no weapons were found in the cave.
that's in two days.
it's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
i don't know. the truth, maybe.
i wouldn't know. the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
other than that... you all right?
that doesn't look much like a library.
what?
you think i don't know you held out on the d.a.? what did you leave out of that testimony? i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes.
i don't believe in little floating people! there is no magic!
coupla days ago they dug up a body in washington heights - mary finelli.  girl disappeared in '68.  turns out she was his first kill.  which means he probably knew her.  most serials know their first victim.  i'm gonna do some checking - see if i can put any of this together...
i don't have to prove shit to you. the ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  you're either in or you're not.  you wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
shit no, it'll be twice cost.
--- yeah, yeah, i get in it in my ear. it's tmj is what it's called technically.
i'm just sad ben -- i mean it was... you were, but, you know. i just don't know...
i walk this way to school with tommy tammisimo.
this is your car.
not if i give you all the cards ...
sure. you boys want anything?
seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
well i of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course i've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
i saw paul leaving.    did you do the dirty deed?
so whatta you... you're not gonna come back to new york?

if you don't want to answer, you needn't. but if you do, you must tell me the truth.
captain says to wait 'til the patrol gits here.

she says she's gonna write fiction.
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on, the waste - i'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away.
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn. true or false?
-- here's a hundred dollars.  and if you or anyone else will back me up on this --

there's nothing on the walls. no pictures--
that klutz.  they send him back here, i'll kick his ass good.
elaine!
i don't know.
uh, excuse me, please. hello, rick.
and now he's addicted to painkillers.
uhh, no.
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
i found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. they belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
like i told ya. my thumbs.
is it dead?
i'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
hello?
you couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
i asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
what have we missed?
i'm not sure, yet... i graduated last spring.
i kinda screwed things up.
i want no more trouble, mr. fennyman. as i explained to you, the theatre business

but, lily--
that's exactly what i said! i mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
right.
cool?
what?
you had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
i know, i know.
there's hot cider in the kitchen.

oh, yes you are.
you made a fool out of me! in front of the fbi!
to be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
mmmmmm. root beer float that sounds good.
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
so...we won?
it put you here.  i'll admit it, it acted like a god and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  i was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  i saw your mouth.  and there you were.  whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  the decision we make now is all that matters.  stay with me.
her father loading up the shotgun?
he didn't think they were risks. he was so good, roy, he could just play with the mark.
it's not funny. he permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
that's the whole thing. you know if you look at it. i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. and everyone's dying. and you better wear a condom or else. but the truth is. i don't know any kids with aids. no one i know has ever died from that shit. it's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
what's it look like i'm doing? i'm tuning a goddamn piano.
because i can't sell it to save my life!  you made a goddamn feathered fish.  is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  nobody knows! i'm beggin' people to book it.
the blood came from somewhere, peters...

i know he's there!  he doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before. jesus christ! <u>you</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? i guess i should have hired a professional.
mr. masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  pg&e is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
couldn't we work in the evenings? six o'clock in the morning? this next month i'm completely at your disposal.  artie is out of town.
you could play the lead.
we got evicted from our home. we've both been on the streets for the last week.
everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. it doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.

colonel munro sent him. he was one of our mohawk allies.
executive assistant.  secretary.  girlfriend?
something's wrong with you.

any school you want.
killing dyson might actually prevent the war.
perfect!
you're late.
why don't we have one more drink, you and i, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
what about the other two?
that was peterson back there.  that goes to the expressway for the airport.

what was the money for?
for who?  the fish?
you're late.  where you been?
buddy boy, how ya doing?
it has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.

got your license?
i don't drive cross country.
why didn't you eat last night?
can you describe the relationship between mr. kramer and his son?
rose, we have a crisis.  i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham.
an outside person.  a foreigner.  a barbarian.  you, me.  more you.
"speaking"!  reeking, seeking, creaking... freaking!
oh, god.

if i'm right, i want to know. i don't want you to lie. i'd be very upset, but not as upset as if i'd found out you'd been lying.
we know that, son.
what way might that be?
would you like a cigarette?
of course, dear.
why you tellin' me that, sheriff?
uh-huh. adam?
'cause you're always out, arresting people.  making trouble.  i don't know why i went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  i couldn't hold my head up, i used to tell people you were a security guard!

old friend?
unless i miss my bet... my wife.
well of course he wants out of hell! the whole point of hell is that you don't want to be here!

if we find nothing, we get creative. just make something up.  instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  the whole thing is under control.
they barely talk anymore.

do you know where she might be?
the check wasn't cashed?
leave myers for the state boys.
don't do anything stupid.
you forgot the "now i'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. see usually that comes before the, "it's over" step. and it always, always comes before the "you can go" step.  what is over?
they love reed and his inquisition! i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  it's becoming the american way!
...under?
...oh, come on! you think the same thing!
maybe it's time we checked that place out.
this is the best movie i've ever seen in my life.
uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
why?
he wears a disguise.
no. be someone else like him. one is enough. and what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. i liked her. i really felt we had something. she could have moved in. we had chemistry.
he's the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran... i ran.
thank you, colonel... i'm afraid i don't know your name.
oh yes.
asta - don't bother mr. macaulay.
now that i'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
you can't bring it.
yes he did.
my name's tyler.  frank tyler. pleased to meet you, ma'am.
to freedom.
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
you've heard of it?
what about it?
i don't think so. just reach on in.
have you got any make up?
i don't think that has anything to do with --
you...
that's right.
please. something is going to happen...
mr. popescu is here tonight.
there's another promise you must make me. that little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. promise me you won't see her.
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon, down on montgomery street.
i had... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had.  it's the most horrible dream i ever had.
okay lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
what're you doing? what about the car?
george! he's supposed to ask you to the dance!
suppose not.
umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
alright! hold up. you win. you got the job.
don't hit that boy no more.
i promise.
my mom works over there.  i'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
er, yes ...
of what?
that's not sayin' much.
i don't know -- i never saw his face.  all i know is, the next day i was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  look, man, you gotta go through with this.
really?
shall i call the police, sir?
this ain't a groc'ry store. we got bread to make san'widges with.
why not me?  what am i - the closing act?
you have lived forever.
well, who says i want you going with me?!
there's no hard feelings, mr denham! i just want to come to the island with you!
how ya doin', ed?
someone else coming?
i wrote the letter.
it wasn't a date. he's just a friend.
when'd you get here?
i'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', david lee.
i loved you ellen - why did you do this?
grace, i need you to come with me.
and living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
and speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy.
you're father thinks it's okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  somehow his opinion doesn't count.
deputy, have you made any id's?
scully?
he's a nice guy, isn't he?
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
they nailed the windows.  i can't get'm open.
it is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
how's your hand?
sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. it just gets moved.
we'll rent a car.
food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that's how i make money.
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  i was up for going to bixby.  i was getting excited.
let me go, dil
all right, i get it. i have bad teeth. you have to understand, in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. it didn't matter.
but not impossible... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
the general atmosphere is very macbethish. what has or is about to happen?
in the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. laurels and tube-roses.  oh, think, suzette -- the villa and the sun at tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, suzette.
i was never - i was never your guest at the tangiers.
back there. you said "the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
roderick, you know well enough that i have never loved but you!  was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you?  have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? no, i loved you too much and too fondly; i have always loved you. from the first moment i saw you, i saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but i could not help loving you.  i married you, though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  what sacrifice do you want from me?  i am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
the dog's always doing that.  and the car's always doing that.
fight the power!
it's just like coming out of a tree house.  did your dad ever build you a tree house, tim, eh?
he's making himself a "woman suit," mr. crawford - out of real women! and he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. a dressmaker, or a tailor -
am i bothering you?
did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
wait. don't.
how's this for a solution. we'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
i'm getting positively haggard. in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
i can't take her with me.
how else do you meet them? pimps? 
i'm melanie daniels. i'm sorry to bother you, but...
excuse me?
isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
who, for instance?
anij!
yeah! how about it? you're a nature lover. do you handle any of that sign language?
what the hell you doing?!
yes.
right.  right.  you think it's the wrong moment.  fair enough.  do you mind if i have a go?
well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
that's a laugh, mrs. robinson. that's really a laugh. ha ha.
he ain't wade.
...was that a pass?
okay, so what is it?
well of course i exist.
as you have been robbed of your purse, may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
"what do we tell him about the guns and money?"
can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
he helped you?
i love you, margie.
no.  why didn't i take her out somewhere? but she was laughing and seemed so happy.
i'll be around to check up on you.
when do you want it to go off?
the usual prospects. convicts, contract killers, murde...
like you?
i'll be ready.
i blame tony pee-pants!
yeah, no shit i just told ya.  hey, you think this place called alien ed's ufo welcoming center is still around? it says, "where the fact is separated from the fantasy."
thanks. see man?
that gives you an idea of what i'm up against!
good morning, mr. parrish.
that's the nature of all progress, william. don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
you're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
no, not that.
yes, but the rope might be--
you forgot the milk.
it won't work --
you men are all so dreadful!
how can i serve you in this?
well, yes.  from a studio point of view, it would be better if simone stayed single.  anyhow, i thought she came across great tonight.  intelligent, well informed, a natural.  and touching. she was spectacular.
how's it feel?
oh.  why is it that you want to get into film financing?
that it is.
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted.
universally rejected. strike three.
five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
what?
hello?
i'm glad you're here.
yes? what is it?
nice friendly approach you've got. goble. i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning.
please, starla. i'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
guess i don't.
unpredictability....
o-kay. we'll skip that question.
don't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha?
watch it, daphne!
they send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. each shell costs as much as a ford 8.
...or films you must see or... 
brookfield just came in.
if i want to be one with them, i have to live like them.
i know.
i have to get out of here.
sorry to interrupt you, sir, but i thought you'd like to know.
it's beginning....
what was prison like?
what's your name?
you didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. but i did.  you kind of liked it, didn't you? that thrill of going over the edge again. of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
he needed some clothes.
what is it?
you want to eat something?
i'm telling you, they changed it!
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard. he's composing his first opera.
i really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
the same interest as yours larry. money. i thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
let's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  of course, i might have brought gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
with all due respect, mr. gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
i know where he is.
i'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
didn't know adlai had it in him. too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
oh, yes, i got in a little late this morning, janosz.
picked it up in shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
the other side got to him.
katherine?... katherine who?
how are you holding up?
where are we? you know where we are. it's called the beach. it's where life first crawled up out of the sea. i come here sometimes... when i feel like crawling back in.
where is she?
susan!
and that's all?
lightweight forward area air device unit.  whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
buddy, i was horrible. i can't tell you who it was, but do you know what i did? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. why, i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  but to get back serious to what i was sayin', it is not only, buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
ow!  watch where you're going!
--millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  it'll just get everybody in trouble.
007. what do you know of the caspian sea?
well, well, he smirked when marty opened the door. if it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, al capone mcfly?
<u>what</u>?  i don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
oh, i miss you. you look beautiful.
oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  can i go in? i need some stuff.
no.
yeah... huh, thank you.  i'm going to go back, sonny, to the hospital. they're really nice people.  they're really trying to help me.
you've gone away from me, ro...  someplace i don't know how to get to.
well, when you put it that way.
you sure? maybe that's the kind of friend i am.
mr. tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
to save the world.
no. it was someone else.
i've spent eighty years looking for another way, captain. this is the only one.  of course, you could always come with me. you fancy yourself an explorer. here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
i know.  i go with you.
a narcissist doesn't admit it.  it's the extreme of self-denial.
never proven. they're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. kids love burger god -
do you have a girlfriend?
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  it didn't seem that long.
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
'ere.  he says he's not dead.
chick-en.
i mean -- about my getting a divorce.
or flowers.
what do you want for free?
i saw one.
i'm going to take that apartment uptown.
how dare you say you love me.
i have a brain.
the sunrise? what for?
that's it.  i resign as of now.
why?
oh—mary—
maybe he's talking to himself.
what did you say his name was?
you didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
is anyone there?
i sleep with my spats on.
well, let me in.
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca.
we'll see you soon, honey. bye.
it is when it works.  you know the one film of mine i can stand to watch?  "kane."  the studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  ed, visions are worth fighting for. why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
but you're here. so you must have come to me.
what do you do when you come here?
hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
you know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  how you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and mom yells at you?
go ahead.
i realize your anger, jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  it's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
"zombie sluts from beyond the grave."
was? as in not anymore?
oh, maaaaan?!
what for?
it was a machine, but it seems almost alive. like a... dance of light.  bud, you have to trust me... please.  i don't think they mean us harm.  i don't know how i know that, it's just a feeling.
good morning, helen.
what?
why not?
'mm ... very nice castle, camelot ... very good pig country....
tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  we were assured they were in tune.
i guess so.
twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the captain is.
i could deny i had those credit cards on the plane with me, laplante...
what for?
everything's being done but it's not enough. i have to find something -- more.
that's what i wanna hear.
i'm gale weathers, author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders, and anchorwoman for total entertainment. maybe you've heard of me?
shit. you better tell me something.
sorry, baby... when's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
good morning. how's it going?
this is not what i requested.
we were different people then.
let him go, vincent.
he asked me to marry him.
how's he supposed to see the wire?
it's my first time.
don't want to be critical, john, but here it is—
oh, fine.  she's gone away for a little while and when she comes back i've sort of resolved to really tell her how much i care for her.
y- s-sure it did.
aunt may, you're trespassing.
she's a trend setter. it's her profession!
mac... let's get out of here.
you needn't be so frank with me about your work.
i've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
what difference does that make?  is dr. woodly going to be my father now?
are you angry with me?
kid. don't waste your time. she's out of your league.
where's the women, man? we gotta have women.
!! ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- i want ya outta the house -- enjoy ya friggin' life... ya hungry, rock?
please --
you two need a time-out.
they just grow like that?
uh-huh.
be good and be smart, little boy.
that's lisa - i gotta get to school.
what the hell -- what is this!? people died. agent carruthers is dead!
are you the boy for me ?
let's jump right into it.  your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  how do you see all of this?
which way? right or left?
you are home. there are lots of kids you still know here.
i wanted to make a statement.
the hatchery, in particular?  you know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory i showed you.
there out on a call, perhaps i can help you-
again.
er ... +      you are the keepers of the holy grail?
what?
but you said you have the worst reputation.
i'm not in love with him.  i'm in love with ghosts.  and so is he. he's in love with ghosts.
dad! you don't think she did it??!
yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
you mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
so last night was pretty exciting, huh?
i don't know. one minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. it's driving me crazy.
flynn! i made it. i worked out some new codes for tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
you think you can stay up with us.
she says she has a secret to tell.
dudley, we've been over this.
hot dogs.
aha! you love him.
how can you even mention spaghetti- o's after eating grandma rosa's dinner tonight?
threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- what do you think!  what do i have to do? draw you a picture?
he came into work.
let's knock off early. go to the mall. something lame like that.
i don't know.
jesus christ! seven months! what am i gonna do for seven months? i'm gonna go crazy. how do i keep my strength? by that time i'll be too weak to win the title. and my weight? forget about it -- i'm gonna blow up like a balloon. i ain't never gonna hold my weight down. seven months! i don't know...
you don't have any fucking money..
ok.
leo has to take the journey, cooch.
-- like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
where've you been?
the cells in our bodies are always changing. in six or seven years all your cells have changed. you could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
thanks. you're a real pal!  what're we goin' to do with it?
take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
like a new year's day hangover.
thank you.  you have one?
can you identify this man?
yes.
it's just an undercoat. 
on paper?
it's good.
i like you so much. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't believe it.
jimmy?  bushmills.   lookit, do me a favor.  i'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
what do my eyes see?
count it.
what?
good, what are you going to do? do you come back?
but thanks.
that would indicate that it's the future.
he can't manifest.
i never finished school myself. never had to. my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. i never struggled for a second.
you wanna release your air tanks?
i'll sign anything you want. <u>please</u>. bring here her .. <u>i want helena here</u> ..
beam the vulcan up -- and we talk.
i hope you like it. it's very exclusive.
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over, too. i have a girlfriend now.
no.
what's that?
you mean louis armstrong?
i've only shown this to three other people. i bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. i keep the coordinates in this room.  it's left over from sdi. reagan's star wars technology? they orbit 426 miles up.
is that supposed to be funny?
and i take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
clearly, you have learned nothing. and you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
miss me?
the garage.
nixon lives in saddle river, new york.
when my money moves, i go with it.
to the eye? like other men.
thank you, mr. gillanders.  thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
i thought as a child. but when i became a man i put away childish things...
i tried to warn you, william randolph. she's got stiletto heels hidden in those keds.
why?
connie.
i got a dress.
if you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, i'd be glad --
lorenzo saint dubois.  but everybody calls me lsd.
i mean we can still... whatever... maybe i should get a towel?
alice, you think you can leave?
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
hello!  hello!  so every time--i just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, i have to compensate the--
the fbi, and the cia, and j. edgar hoover and oil companies and the pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the white house?
do you hear anything?
sit down.
that's the boy.
what else do you think about during school?
you know him?
most of 'em are late-model...
jesus christ, is she for real?
your family still carries the name corleone, and you will run it like a corleone!
what is it, betty?
i guess we're in for it.
<u>did</u> you want to be killed by it?
why would he take it?  he don't even know you.
what the hell are you doing? this is my girl. mine!
we will assume full management of the colorado lode - of which you, mrs. kane, are the sole owner.
sure, i'll keep an eye on her.
no...
this has nothing to do with you.
i'd like to offer my congratulations. that was a beautiful gesture of howard's.
what time is it?
bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...
just talked to orwell down at the garage. says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
ah, you bet your life you didn't! you look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find miss mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
i never want to go through this again.
i don't know. can we turn it off? i have such a headache.
hi, everybody. am i late?
long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  i miss rorschach.  let's spring him.
whoa, whoa...  what do you expect them to say, you're alan dershowitz?
yeah.
bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  did you get pictures?
whatever i said, i didn't mean it, okay?  i get a few drinks inside me --
<u>i don't know</u>.  talley talked those punks into letting smith out.  he's fucking us over, glen.  that guy is fucking us over.
i see you're sticking to the diet betty put you on...
how'd he die?
cluster of events.  don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  three times inna night.
are you hungry?  wanna get something to eat?
-- and then?
you don't know what you're missing. this is the mt. everest of hacks.
it's a single sequence repeated over and over.
i never met anyone from seattle before.
and the seas would boil ...
it appears well.  it has already clotted.
i don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?
your wife and children...you're happy with them?
i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
um...i'd rather not say...just yet.
oh, man. i'd have to get into gary's house. to get the satellite positions.
oh yes i do! i have something right here!
lemme ask you something. i put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
please answer the question, doctor.
shut up.
no, mister mcmurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton.
yeah?
you want that?
or the living fall in.  who knows.
your life has been defined by institutions.  the orphanage where you were raised, the fbi academy, the bureau.  if the institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  ask to be reinstated on the "drumgo" task force.  play their game.
the building on the corner.  that one!  he's been on the roof a half hour now!
i guess i should go.
i can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  to feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
are you okay?  you want some help?
two?
oh, yes, george bailey. whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
you going to call the police?
the great war?
don't worry. i can protect my virtue. i mean, c'mon, wade, give me a break.
i come to you as a last resort -- and i confess that my patience is wearing thin.  must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
what time did this thing happen?
not everything is an illusion.  my hand... wasn't that real?
looks like quite a way to go...
...the archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
yes.  it is a crime. a serious crime.
uh-huh.
you're here.
we brought your laundry, miss boatwright.
there was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
i'll kill you for that!
c'mon, man.
no. i didn't.
how are you today?
for one thing, you like expensive things.
how did you know it was "carefully"?
oh--saunders--
a little.
pull on your works. your privates.
yeah, right.
and the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
you okay, jerome?
we don't publish a record in the paper, i can tell you that.
promise me you'll be all right....
that's not true...
been a long time, huh...?
do you have to be so brutal?
got no plans, rayburn, nothing on. just wanted to see you, how you were. came by on impulse.
you bought this for me?
i didn't get it either.
alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
snoopy miller, famous fight thrower.
they didn't let me. i am in disgrace. last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note. the conductor got so excited he yelled, "there's sabotage in the string section!"
but, after all, you have yours.
will you take me?
i heard that they were running cold.
just people people, you know. just people.  had a dead man once.
what is that?
is elvis out?
i heard you. but i got to arrange a legal defense first. i got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
no, baron, no. i'm afraid mozart is a lost cause. he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna. he is constantly drunk. he never pays his debts. i can't think of one person to whom i dare recommend him.
this is matt hooper...
shall we go on?
won't you change your mind, sir? what can i say to convince you?
maybe i do.  ...what a fuckin' mess, huh?  people can change brian.
int. tunnel - day.
am i on my feet...?
great.  so what are you guys working on?
charles!  i didn't know you were back.  have a good holiday?
seond safety.
you like to call me linda now?
yeah.
mom, vincent's not interested.
no.
swell. i appreciate it.
don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
...afraid.
does that have a hidden meaning?
i'll make it up to you this summer. i promise.
darling, your father's all right. he'll turn up in time.
guess!
babe brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
what does that matter? but you've... you've... felt like this before...
this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ain't back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
do you have a history of emotional problems, mr. wigand?
thank you david.  however, flattery will get you nowhere.  truth is, i have a rather different plan for whistler's dear mama.  bernie and i have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
in a fight?
you called me your girl?
if there is anything we can do for you...
do not confuse yourse{fi why? we must strike a heavy blow. this cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
what does that mean? "rife with -- ?"
and yet you chose to leave him?
apparently, yeah.  i was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
well then, perhaps you also ---
i didn't make up the name.  it's the steely dan song.  and it was in the commitments.
i can tell.
he didn't leave us.
you know what the fuck i'm talkin' about. you talk to her?
what can i say, jack?
you know i do.
a lordship. and gold. that i should become judas.
you shouldn't a done that.
forget it.
oh yeah...?  alright.
how do you write women so well?
i have a cb in my truck, we could get some help out here.
you shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. this is family business and we have to pull together.
who is?  but then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  you gotta look at it as peace of mind.  as <i>security</i>, you know what i mean?  i got offices in detroit, miami, boston, take your pick.
something is going to happen. when it's over you'll know what i was talking about.
i don't know where to go.
what?
can i -- i mean -- do you mind -- if i wear this again. professor tripp?
you fill the bill, bill.
and this is the evening edition. notice anything?
...congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. reinvented the wheel. i'm going to recommend to the board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
have you seen hugo?
we have to stop them from sending that message.
'at's-a no good.  i went to niagara falls once.
and if they want to drink merlot, we're drinking merlot.
i guess i just don't understand anything.
susan, i want you to stop this. and right now!
he said -- "which we already knew!"
someone names a lot of warts on line two.
really, i've got to stop this business with ettore... i would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. you know, i had many ideas...
yes, i know.
c'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
me?!  it's not me, it's god who makes everything complicated!  if he's all-powerful, why not let the english stay on their island in the first place?  and why let this war go on for a hundred years?  and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  why, why?!
yes.
it looks like white's game.
that's easy!
you saw west's body.
ganz is in jail.  he's gonna be there two years after i'm on the street.
and what?
night after that?
mauduh...
i wouldn't do anything hasty. let's get a little light on the subject.
you see, captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
you feel violated?
i'm booted up.  go, ethan.
that's not what i'm saying at all.  you know where he went?
there is nothing.
why?
he's not in this class.
that's not why he's sending me.
i want to feel something else than this.  it's either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire.  unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
was there somebody in your room when i called you?
but you've stamped this form before! why won't you stamp it now?
i don't know... he's a little disgusting... although some women go for that.
i wasn't hallucinating.
have a favour to ask. i want to get out of here.
i can't figure out why he's doing it. he's been richard taupin at least since 1967.  and the guys rich.  you should see the stuff he has in that shop.
why bring us inside? not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
you are correct.  sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  such as your own, for example.  how do you feel about physical labor?
oh my god.
and little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if i needed i ri-hide --
yeah, i peed in the fountain there once.  give me a break.
from the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'tattler' early tuesday morning.
excuse me... your voice is familiar and i'm sure i know you from somewhere...
i hope you can show more than you did when you let the yakuza butcher linda lee.
but it's hopeless! they can't go back and they can't go on. i tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
you don't believe that either, do you? why can't you see my side?
single?
oh.
why are you doing this?
don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  you needn't concern yourself about me, young man. i can take care of myself.
walter...stay away from me!
don't you want answers?
no. i want to give him <u>more</u>. i want to give him a massive dose.
i got in early. i was excited...  who was that guy?
no.
i wasn't there last night, either.
i haven't done anything.
how 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
love gives you wings.  it makes you fly.  i don't even call it love.  i call it geronimo.
you what?
wait, wait. don't hang up.
you ever been married, mr. whale?
how's the journal?
great.  this is great.  the whole town knows.  just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
i'm driving.
really? because i don't know, i was thinking that --
i wouldn't worry too much, commissioner.  it'll pass.  we've had this sort of thing before.
but i'll tell you something, what i said in their, still goes. you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
obviously, but what's the way out ?
...it's all in the hands really. you know you have nice hands, you operate?
okay, tiger.  time for bed.
yeah?

left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  please don't smoke. with minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- did you go out in a boat and look around?
that don't do us any good.

uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
ah, but therein lies the paradox.  it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  the longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  however many doors you lock, someone will always get in. even here.

you ever think back to how you started.
and she's all wrong for me!

where's the rest of it?
oh i doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
what's wrong with your hand?
what is it?  did you forget something?
what happened?
... it's an old story.  i grew up in south boston, more or less on the streets.  by the time i was thirteen i'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen i'd stopped using but i was dealing full-time.  by the time i was nineteen i decided i didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  one day i got on a bus; i got as far as ohio before my money ran out, and after that i just kept walking.  didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  i ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  there was a storm... i woke up...  and that's about as far as words'll go.
god help me -- yes.
now listen, this is the plan. as soon as school is finished we go to utah and...
lillian was here. in lawford.

i'm sorry i got you into this.
i think he must've fell in.
yeeaoowww!!
if only i didn't feel guilty asking annie to move out. it'd probably wreck her. but i should be honest.
whose side are you on?
where?  what?
"dear ms. hughes.  we're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."

but you could get killed, right?

cold?
you will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
i never know nothing.
uh-huh.
okay, lady. out.
weir.
...my love...
this looks to me like a good sign. don't you think so? as far as i'm concerned, anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. why... as a matter of fact, i remember when i was in china, many years ago, i happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an english woman, the wife of ambassador shafford, a good friend of mine. there, too, we found a bible... and i said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. why, it was logical, i said, that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore...  no? you don't believe it? well, as a matter of fact, i was right... the woman was found two days later. it was a case of amnesia.
is it?
why not call for help?
oh my god...you're proposing?
you have two murders to investigate. this man's head was beaten in. and there's nothing in his pockets.
and i was wondering.
what about a summary then.
are you out of your mind...?
not too active.
what do you do?
my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
i'm going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission.  jean, can you raise me up there?
you don't, do you?
you dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
what are you doing?
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
you too, sweetheart...
i'm not kidding.
because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
let me look at it.
you think that's funny
i will!  goodbye, darling!
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
you're an amazing woman.  what a feeling having you inside my head.
mr. bond! nice to see you.
well, even without anesthesia i always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
good theory.  but i like my mother. i have no aversions to what she does.
'"... or i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house down!" and inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
i have to get these dispatches to hillsboro.
oh, that is disgusting.
what? she threw me out, remember. she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn. only we didn't make it. she can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
did da -- jason --- get good grades?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
dr. carlson's dead?
good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
now, that's practically uncut. you could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
layered?
and all the time i've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. you should quit making waves.  go with the flow.
anything i've forgotten?
benjamin -- what's happening?
tom, you're the consigliere; you can talk to the don and advise him.
can i ask you a question? why did you come here today? if you found this deed, why didn't you just ask eddie?
you think because you represent the former duchess...
you two fighting's not going to get us anything.
any more ...
i feel like when i was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
man we fucked him up.
sweetheart, what is it?
the deputy director, this prick locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
smoke !
german. mine, too. so who do you think's given more to the world, the germans -- beethoven, goethe, nietzsche -- or the entire continent of africa? ibos, bantus, mandingos...
you gotta be kidding me.
i'm a witness to a murder.  that seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
an' you're a weeper and a wailer always treading the toes of the great generally spreading your weight you're a spiteful, hateful asinine creature a pupil with no scruples who knew better than the teacher

the kid's sorry, auggie.
no-i guess not.
i'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, jeff.
sandro, listen... try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
you think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
shall we start the, uh...
those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
you're not responding to the stimulus.  i can see right here, i'm not getting a reading.
do you think you could do something, sidney?
the same reason everyone does.  you hear your name on c-span and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
that music is for everyone, mister mcmurphy.
are you serious?
what's that?
i don't mean nothin' by it.  i just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
fine. send it right away. i don't want him to fire arthur.
hi.
okay.  after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the cpc.  here it is.  ten packages from the same sender.  baku. delhi.  st. petersburg.  the guy was a real road warrior.  this package was kuala lampur.  no activity in his account after this package.  no forwarding addresses after k.l.
no. he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. to cleveland, actually.
for you.
i can't believe they still ate it.
m'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.

try sitting down.
you really look better.
but if all i can give 'em is ordell's name -- i don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that don't give me much to bargain with.
fifteen crowns.
you must have some feeling.  some immediate impression.  a young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  and the things that went on in that house.  such wild sex.  what kind of picture does that paint?
what's the matter with you?
the forager's back.
but it is being used, isn't it, father?
i smoke more these days. i smoke more when i'm unhappy.
oh, are you all right?
please, jacqueline.

i appreciate it. i do, but...maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
i'm making you feel like meat?
and thanks for always being happy!
i'm fine.
oh, yes. and *i'm* helping. simple-- and i'm helping. so we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
i give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.

easthampton hospital for women. excuse me, what is that, a joke? let me tell you something, doctor, those men at catherine laboure. men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  they were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
i want to fly it! can i fly it now, mommy!
oh, sure, sure. but first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in reno -- meanwhile, i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --

oh. when did you move back?
captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...

"how's that lily?" "oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  my friend would say this....but then sometime...i went to another school, you see? but then...when high school at the end, what's that?  what is that?  when you get to the end?

alfredo died. do you remember him?
and my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.

"our customers?" you think that mr. l.l. bean out there is going to be a regular?
what is that?
there is no smoking in this building, ms. tramell.
aaagh!
i don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
what it is?
thanks.
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom.
nick... sal is very weak. he suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
bobby, you've been dreaming again.
perhaps not. i feel fine.
if you let him testify then it would have all come out. west was supposed to take care of it out there, shut nunez up and then disappear. but it got messy and people got killed. so you called your old pal tom hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
you're too young to be studying criminal behavior. it's making you obsessive.
see, you didn't believe me!.. now i suppose you don't think i have the courage!
carefully, tough guy.  very carefully.
well, it's all just part of this - they don't know i need it, see. okay, so there's that. and even if they did, i wouldn't get it.  so there's that on top, then. see, these're personal matters.
cigarettes and beer rule! huh huh.
what does it say?
a factor of age.
do you want to die?
that be so, better you pinch yourself now, jack.
jeff, call the fbi right away...
uh, yeah, being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
good idea of yours to come out here, harold. it's a lovely spot.
well... it'll probably work out. we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
not an easy book.
you don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
we're throwing him a last supper. we came to invite you.
an angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
if you've already killed her that's fine.  i'll keep the bonds and the cash.  we got nothing to discuss.
yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  i'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. and you know why?
this is inga.  they thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
i found them in your file box.
so are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to delacroix or set up a meeting?  i'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhati'msayin'.
i don't know...you...i don't know.
i'd like to hear it.
i haven't gotten it yet.
hong kong, mr. bond!
johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  you used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  were they true?
we're not coming out.  we're not letting you in.  get out of my house. 
well --  - they say he was very wise, so i'm sure he must have.
could take a little while, though.
it's just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. and, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great -- i mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i don't know, maybe i'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
would you like to see it?
okay, deal.
poor old shapeley. you shouldn't have frightened him like that.
what do you mean "on his way up"!?
and what was that one about my mother?  that was a good one.
exactly.  at least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
let's not fight, hildy. tell you what. you come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
suppose i wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would i need a warrant?
speak english!
very smart indeed.
you're not interested in him?
now, holly's not shy.
let's get the fuck outta here. you're not making any sense, man.
what the hell does that matter?
...i'm going to see lecktor.
...i can find a place tomorrow, then i'll be outta your hair.
just... come on, what would it mean to you?  that sentence? "i haven't seen evil dead ii yet?"
so, anyone talk to janelle?
it hit me like a ton of bricks.
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  what is it? you have a fight?
who do think you're dealing with, huh?  i'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
marzzone?  as in angelo marzzone, head of the marzzone family?
but you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
this the only spare?
i know.
one alive, one not. yet both in pain.
oh yeah.  the one that used to confess to everything?  hoping we'd beat him up?
who's here!?
i am not a good singer.
is that your professional opinion?
one number two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... anything else?
i guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
what about the letter?
no. it's a down payment.
oh, miles. you're drunk.
but... betsy...
the door was open, swear to god, i'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
what for?
i... i can't find my seatbelt.
then...
i hope she's a good sailor....
that's all the windows, dad.
would you like to know what's in it? the report.
look he figured it out !
and this is the return you make for his kindness!  didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of jamesville yonder?
the whole facility was shut down in the forties, wasn't it?  some kind of scandal...
i am very sorry.
that's what she called him on the show.  because he can't sleep.
this - what's it called? - this place, i love it - this is mine!  i'm asking the king permission to call it the almasy bosphorous.
sure.  no problem.
they are in our airspace. we would be within our rights.
did she drown?  the woman you told me about?
get down!  he'll see.
.          .. spock's tube...
and another thing... it is not always necessary to tell the truth.
and that was all?
i had nothing to do with that.  was he ... in the ellsberg thing?
what?
we can liquidate the station.  take the athena back.
"dad says we gwan sleep on it.
i'm working trains. selling.
blue soup.
try a year and a half. he bands her an old snapshot. pilar looks at it--
it's not easy to be calm when -
let's go right now.  let's go to the zoo.
i know. i have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
it wasn't a bad bust.  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him.
then i envy yo.
that's when i was a saxophone player. now i'm a millionaire.
a little precaution, sir. i've had traps set for me before now. there are people in central services who'd love to get their hands on harry tuttle.
so can i come along?
i don't see no crowd around you, neither.
if i pick it up, we'll only get back together.
why?
that's how he got so big. when he quit the marines he was just a little guy.
nope.
the news is not good, kid. this bit here... see there... it's broken. you need a new  one.
she just seemed... depressed... ?
can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
that's great!  see, you're getting it.
i'll need that.
huh?
can we get him to the hospital?
i'm guessing no.
you sure you're okay -- ?
last show of the night.
you got a boyfriend?
you look wonderful. i'm on top of the world tonight, lila. work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
get up, willa.
let me ask you a related question. we've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  what is your policy for treating addiction?
and when she left, she never came back.
like what?
really?  and maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
was it my fault? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon, hildy -- honest i did.
i've told you.
probably the same thing my mom would do if i got engaged... have a heart attack.
that's so sad.
send them home. we are not the police. what do we have to protect them?
to kill the king.
oh, man --
don, i was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
you get in trouble?
see does he want some.
when they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. i mean: i'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but i'd never heard the tapes ....
what'd you do?
mr. liebkind, mr. liebkind.
that's impossible...
oh, my god.
that one.
uh... yes. not for us. no woman in jeopardy. find me dr. quinn medicine woman. find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
it's just a dream.
contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
yeah, josh, c'mon... move it!
i beg your pardon?
our group is full.
dawn!  dawn!
this answers one of our questions.
for the love of god would you two give it a rest?  lord almighty.  in all my years i have never seen anything so pathetic.  how far did you think you were going to get with this?  neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  now use what little smarts you got.  if i was going to bust you i wouldn't have waited until after you killed jake.
no.
mr. helms, we've lived with communism in cuba for ten years ...
so we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got emergency service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  i say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  i go to get the cigar and boom!  all the sudden i turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  right where i was standin'.  that coulda been it.  i coulda had my head blown off and for what?  some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  if i hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - i would've had my head blown off.
not the most popular opinion, but yes.
come on, pinky! give 'em a little third degree.
you shouldn't go into another man's tent. it's inexcusable.
don't start, farmer.
that's something i can't spare you.  but i won't do it myself.
if you're going to drink it in here, i'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
you're so pale... i hope you're not coming down with something.
--we will--
jesus christ!!!!!
yes?
what's up? jess ready?
god.  you would.  come on, bruce.  i just want to get two drinks in you.  as an experiment.
why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
your sister told me hands off, but i can't help myself...
dr. lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density.
oh, come off it, man.
answer me a couple things?
now, mister gi...
i won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, i suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
yeah?  what's up?
eventually you'll let go.
see that girl? that's jacqueline's sister. it's because of her i ask.
you're right!  it's tuesday already! by gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
yes.
what are you doin'? you gotta get out of here!
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
are you sure?
and that's it. do you have it?
but you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
but your life and lands are far from here.
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
i always suspected the effects might come back. that's why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
muncie.
yo, big black, we needs a name for this joint.
thanks, joe.
what about matt ?
what?
now that wasn't a friendly thing i heard, toddy.  not at all friendly.
insubordination.  to the emperor... and the senate.
and they have very mixed feelings about women.  they hate them in a way.  one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  they can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
this is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
something's made you sore.
yeah.
and he's making them give five million of it to you all.
uh huh ...
the shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--he still claims one of the lasers we fired at the jenkins gang burned down his store..
a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it's a dead end.
the people will not allow it.
yeah, don't stop. keep going.
over a sleeping brean, stretched out on a poolchair, grace, the secretary, comes out on to the pool area, holding the shot of a small, foreign looking child, in front of a pile of rubble. she shows it to moss.
stop!
well--we're newlyweds.
i would love to come for dinner.
hello, jean luc.
the bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. this is just a flurry, that's all. they've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. wait a minute. get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
so how 'bout it, mr. selznick, do i make my deal with bo? or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
no.
no. you drove us here.
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de niro had been in. or i could maybe do an al pacino movie, play a hard-on. but i couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. they don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
cancer, brain... brain cancer?
you think too much?
but you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  well, it's not my first script.
the doctors were not negligent.
i'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
i won't let 'em, nick. they won't hurt you anymore.
it must be alright. he's still running around digging up tombs. besides, he's had experience.
you want to see me? well, here i am.
fine!  eat in the cupboard.
yeah, you do.  i'd be bugging myself, edgar ... who'd get the tapes?
he was a good guy for a long, long time. just - not long enough.  gotta catch my flight.. so.  how's it feel being a solid citizen again?
i didn't want you to be upset. i shouldn't have lied. stacy, there's nothing between me and rachel banks.
a hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
i'll tell him.  what is it?  is it a mine?
oh matt, you must be mistaken.
don't worry. they're not going to hurt you. come on.  only show this to the driver. nobody else. and don't lose it.
you're so sweet.
where did we first hear th...
h'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
i've never seen him before.
well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us.  just the dentist tomorrow.
the queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us.
...they say you're alright.
yes -- australia, and you must have suspected i would have known the powder's origin, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
anything i can help you with?
jeff, would you go in with her?
have they analyzed the one that was killed?
mommy saying, 'wake up, wake up, wake up danny, wake up.'
here's <u>weak</u>...mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and brad's <u>parents</u>!!  can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
in amity, you say 'yahd.' 
i'm a patriate.
eddie, if i was a pirate, i wouldn't throw you to the crew.
you are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  he is a lucky man.
i know you as well as i know myself, shinzon. there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
i couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." as if it were the most normal thing in the world. "ho-hum, what lovely tea, i think i'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
unavailable.
am i?  i'm not so sure.  i used to be sure of a lot of things.  oh, different things from week to week, but now-- i'm not sure of anything anymore.
yeah. burnfield, pizza and puke capital of the world.
i'm not listening.
maybe. but, if i were gonna hack some heavy metal, i'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
someone gave it to you? where was this old house?
the well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... oh yeah! i have to show you something else!
look at this, pinkerton! they got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
no, are you kidding me, bob, not at all.
you don't miss much.
2:30.
yeah, i'm sure.
certainly not.  i'm a happily married man.
i don't see why you're still here. you look healthy to me.
there's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
so what do i tell this guy?
and you, and you friend doyle --  did you hear from him again -- since he left?
okay to proceed.
i went to sophie's and she was very hospitable.
would you? actually, you could.
you were gone for a while.
why don't you try the assignment.  or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
well, yeah, sure...
i mean it, jack.  behave.
i just wanted to know where mom was?
in a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd, dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
why not? he has great pants.
you know, all this nightmare we went through with hearst. the whole thing... and in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
i went to bed. freddie's a big man, but i'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. i've suffered all day. who found him?
well, what's the point of waiting?
i said i wonder if you could help me.
brother bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
don't ask me.
but you've got a big choice right now. you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  i personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and i don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
diane!!!!
did your servant got word to dr. drossos?
gray, i must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
get rid of dodd for me.
i believe so. saw it on a television show, once.
i dove 315 feet!
you took this picture?
a complete surprise?
and that's why you never went pro?
good things...
why didn't you call?
except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
okay. i'll copy it.
trust me.  call that number.
is that his tart? does pat have a tart?
do you have it?
no. really, i am.
you don't need a picture. just look up handsome in the dictionary.
no.  go ahead.  you're gonna be great.
you're good, princess. i'll give you that.
of course not. they're possibles. i've checked them against bureau records, check them against your file. how did you get it?
cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
we need to talk.
can't sleep?
huh?
because my son is...  my son seems to be fond of you.  and i...  i'm not quite sure how i feel about it. i really don't know if i... like you or not.
you either need a new uniform or a new neck.
you look awful.
page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if i'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
vincent?
and the baby.
would you be more comfortable barefoot?  feel free to remove your boots and socks.
everything going okay?
but... i thought...
make the call.
how are you doing?
i think i dropped an earring.
who?
listen, you're right.  don't do it. i'll just... send you an address, okay?
i'm in awe.
ok, austin danger powers: one blue crushed-velvet suit. one frilly lace cravat. one gold medallion with peace symbol. one pair of italian shoes. one pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. one vinyl recording album: tom jones, live at las vegas. one swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
a movie *outside*?
...when you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? do something they didn't know they were capable of?
you don't like me?
use the fucking bomb!
sure.  vivovich.
the man's an ambulance chaser...
he suggested i ask you.
he didn't see me.
i know you, huh?  the car pools, he measles, the pta.  it's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  you have to think long term.
yeah?
we're all square now, harry. right?
sure, charlie.
can i hear you?
do you have a baby?
i won.
i called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  i don't know what he's got to be mad about.  i'm the one who should be mad.
what do you want from me?
so...?
i don't know. i only saw one.
you met people.
due in nashville.
like you taught me...
protest finally forced "amos and andy" off the air.  could stop us from ever getting on.
how did brown & williamson know i spoke to you...?
if you're having some.
i think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
what about narcotics?
pleasant journey?
and you did a bang-up job, too.  but you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  trust me. it's a career killer.
they learned.  they cut the power and avoided the guns.  they must have found another way in, something we missed.
i'd rather you didn't.
<u>what do you want</u>?
what it's going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds' film can: gateway lab, st. louis, missouri.
hey, this works pretty good.
oh, mr. dickson - they're going to arrest matt. they think he did it!
the tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
john belushi... <u>jim</u> belushi...
we will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... we must be patient... finally we got the spring, didn't we? we got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
what am i, an ass?  when you called me, i called elkins, and her bosses. nothing she saw is proof of anything.
what time?
good-night dad.
that thing? who'd you steal it from?
has sue got it right?
fucking.
now take deep breaths, and push.
do you like it?
we have to talk.
sophie.
...don't do it to me...
we have work. it pays a lot. unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
no, m'lord.
well, it is kind of a long shot...
uh, no, i didn't see him at all.
what's the matter, boys? is my slip showing?
i have an apartment. i don't remember exactly where. my dog knows, though.
yeah?
what lizard?
jim, itís over.
bundt cake?
oh... you mean you don't want to.
listen, adele, the reason i called, that party is today instead of sunday. about eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  so you'll have to get hold of buddy, whatever he might be doing...
don't you want to see what daddy does for a living?
ed, can i see you a second.
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking. we'd be set up for life!

do it for you.
listen to me, cocksucker. there is no keyser sate. if you say his name again, i'11 kill you right here.
he saw her at the northern care...
i know the feeling. it won't last.  he's a long way ahead of where i was at his age.
it's getting too cold even for me, nick.
why didn't you tell me about snyder before?
this is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a festival of love.  the mayor and chamber of commerce don't want tv announcing killers on the loose.
i understand.
you know what i'm gonna do after this...i'm gonna get a normal life...
that was beautiful.
i mean it tastes like every other fish i've ever had. every fish tastes the same.
you tell me.  i'm new in town.
you don't trust me?
is there a press conference today?
of course.
goddamn! how long have we had this fucking dog?!  two years, he still doesn't come!  we need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
most unusual. an unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...

sergeant major!

okay, that's not so bad, ah tim?

he's gonna set up gondorff for us.
you don't know monsieur philipe?

negative. this is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
it was blown up with the plane.

i'm a salesman.
you would never understand my life. you're not chinese.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "dine with buljanof, iranoff, and kopalski."
i don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, i'm getting out of here.
dad's disappeared!
could we try it now?
who's the hell is that?
what about her?
he's gonna die, ain't he?
what's that?
thanks, i'll keep it in mind.
that's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  you fellers'll have to figure it out.  you're scientists  all i know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
but now casanova's back! and we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
do you have everything you need from command?
... hmmm... elevator.

pardon me?
yeah, it's good.
but i thought...
i've done the slut thing, david. it's really kinda old.
not really, no.
why?
what's involved, aside from putting up the money? what're you looking for the partner to do?
i'm going to put a guard on your door.
if i may make a suggestion... we have different weak spots than you do.  next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect i think you were looking for.
hey, mr. d., what's happenin'?
our neighbors gave me a ride.

i'll miss you, mike.
intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...

i heard you talking. hasn't rose come in?
what can i do for you, mr. kirby?
you did create me.
okay, meet me out front.  i gotta go. josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
hold that thought.
thanks very much sam.
stop it!  i'll make it easy. you were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. it was an accident, but his girl is a witness. you've had to pay her off. you don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. yes or no?
oh. well, thank you! how wonderful. some people get all the luck.
... and this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  as your father?
what's the matter? isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
what?
you designed it?
ay me!
some kind of animal?
your old files -- ?
alma i told you to...
so what's next?
i said, how ya feelin'?

hmmm.
they're trying to come through the door!

jesus.

everybody loves lisa. everybody loves lisa. but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
if he was just a man like me, then no.  but he's not.
i don't know.
i'm going out for awhile.
i want this ship searched from bow to stern. lieutenant saavik, you are in charge. start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
and do you like it that way?
but don't you like anything about what you do? 
so...now what?
and it's sexier in the dark.
yes, betty?
i haven't slept in weeks.
yeah, okay.
michael, yes, we was all relieved...
loan shark -- hey?
recruited you from where?
i think so.
i know the facts, mr. kane.  and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  you're a man of great talents, mr. kane.
i will meet you, but only one way -- if robert the bruce is there, and puts his hand on my bible, and swears his loyalty to scotland.
nice threads dad.
...ah, fuck this...
you don't see any blood?
here we are. you'll be all right here, miss.
so tell me about it.
car and a driver, mr. brean, the westgate, now, please...
how long were you married?
burt!  heather!
i don't know how to thank you.
thanks. and isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
don't see why i can't ride, too! i'm second in command, damn it!
nightwing.  scourge of darkest evil.
you didn't say serial killer and i didn't say serial killer.
i was freezing from the hurricane --
only if i repeat them outside this room.  and, i will if i must...  out there, for all to hear.  or... you may speak, as planned.  but, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
to do my work well, i have little time for --
well, that explains it. anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
you okay?
your majesty.  this ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of paris -- we have no way of checking --
of sorts.
that's because he is. does that upset you?
this is not about martyrdom.
i'm not going with you.
then i will consider it a declaration of war. one. two... three.
get <u>out</u> of here!
please don't be negative, drew, we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud -- the secretary-general of the un, the chairman of the fcc, nine senators, i don't know how many congressmen, and at least twelve of the fortune '500'.
somewhere else.  i've never been anywhere else.  just once.  years ago.  went to the state fair.  it was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
you wanted to warn me...
i love you.
you get her those vitamin e right away.
what?
that's really what you want.  you become furious when people won't make you dead.
you'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. last week i saw a purple martin. and the week before that, i saw a solitary vireo. that's rare.
maybe she needs help, ted. you should be a gentleman.
yes.
let me see how you did that one.
you ever go to the kelbo's? on pico?
any history of epilepsy in your family?
still beautiful louis. you always were the strong one.
do you see that, colonel?
nice car. how much did you pay for it?
tv, man! farrah fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
commodus must hate you.  free your gladiators and come with us.
and spring fling.
systems register functional.
you're wastin' your time.
okay, and listen, i would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
save it for your wife.
first things is, don't say, "what's going on?" everybody knows what's going on. i come into this situation, i say,  "i'm glad to see nobody's hurt. that's good. i'm here to help you."  second: you hesitated. don't hesitate. if you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. which you are. if he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. you don't want him nervous. got that?
meet my partner, gloria perez.
i don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
he's big, hutton.  you never saw anything so big.  watch yourself.
deeper. softer. none of your twittering larks! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
yes.
did i ever tell you, i dislocated uncle merrill's arm?
i don't remember the exact date.
not really...
what sort of injury did he have?
excuse me.
come on sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  this is not a personal thing, this is business.
shut up -- i'm talking.  you got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
take her to my house. my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. do you have anything to put around her?
to be quite honest it turns my stomach.
okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
102  continued:
i'm turning you.
why? because you can do it alone?
my days are not the old days, genius.
at some point a man's got to get serious about his future. i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about.
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
i've heard just about enough of this lunacy! go to your room!
i knew you were lying.

wonderful!
you?  you think you're the only one?  i've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
that thing is poisonous.
twenty-after-ten.
you set this all up, didn't you?  one of your sick jokes?
we're not.
who's that?
i'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.

ten flights?
i don't want to hurt charley— i don't want to hurt you...
mother o'god...

you can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  when they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.

north korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system.  extraction team has to be small and silent -- i'd go with seals over delta force. problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  where's the polk?

hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
what went wrong?
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
what did cox pull him out early for?
not when i'm with you, ted.
i'm an old friend of cochrane's... i wanted to see how he was doing.
where are we going?
no. but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it.
hi!
well, to tell you the truth, i lied a little.
you're thirteen months older than me, frank. that might've meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
why for?  them boys are real player haters.
here's where we're at.  three men in a room.  the victims here. anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. the exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but i can't make out the location. government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
...yeah. but two's enough not to look anxious...
edie. the commission. your subpoena. i know you got a subpoena.
huh.
you got to go sometime. you got to go out there by yourself sometime.
i did exist. i do exist. i'm the same person!
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement.
what do i gotta do?
harvey keitel. yeah. maybe. he was pretty good in the movie "fingers".
no.
daddy?
there's no accounting for taste. believe me, you could use a good kiss.  you've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. it's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  i could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  but it's too late now, sweetheart.  your big opportunity is flying out of here.
that doesn't make any difference. i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. they have a very special value for her.
if it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. even when i mean 'em, they don't come easy.
fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.
yes.  it felt like flynn.
at least kiss me when you do that.
what's my name?
something may be wrong at regula i. we've been ordered to investigate.
can i offer you something.    a drink? coffee?
bastard's got his high beams on.
what happened?
yeah.
doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. until then-
i love zoos.  ever since i was a kid.
i was in prison for twenty-eight years.
that's what i'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  just lemme talk to joey to... to apologize.
i guess i could be chalant about it, but then again i'm not even sure if that's a word. listen chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but i gotta case to crack.
right before the wedding?
what do they do up there?
i can't do this. it's not right.
like you and gordon?
how well do you know this place?
have you got your gun on now?
me too.
that will be all, major.  i'll wait for lord cornwallis.
you used to like it stark!
look who's talking! the great white father, and world's champion of women's rights.
huh?
why didn't you send johnnie farragut?
what is this shit?
i'm fine, babe.  i'm gonna take a little walk.  i need a minute.  let's forget it. my life didn't pass in front of my eyes. so, it probably wasn't that close.
...too early...
what's it about?
i think we should go on by ourselves.
it's ok; i'm sorry i called you a failure.
really?
i really can't.  besides, it's pretty interesting.
kathy?
now hold on! we should hear her out!
hi.
no, sir.
not it at all, really.
ask him.
i think the ground's getting closer.  i think we do it.  we're gonna save our asses here!
why don't you take a rest, brian?
that from the lock?
did you have dinner, father?  we have plenty.
obviously.  one ticket of passage to south america -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
what are you doing out here?
me.
you mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
what the hell do you want?
i was trying to educate you.
you know i'm always happy to see you, jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
whaddya want to know? my sign?
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
but you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. and you were right. we should wait.
you're it.
did you call anyone?
that's right.  it's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
geez, don't listen to them.
no, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
i'm allison, you're 'honey'.
like father, like son.
i wanted to apologize for this morning.
ed...
can i go with you today?
i'm taking over the center seat. i'm sorry, will.
but i thought vampires didn't like the light.
what plane.
we're hung up here.  snagged.
commander, i have to log it...
you trust this moonan guy?
i'm sorry; of course, you know that.
where the hell is it!?
no.  she, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  that-that can lead to other things.
you know... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way. has that ever happened to you?
listen--tomorrow i take him to see monuments--if i have to hit him over the head with a couple!
i don't understand.  what do you want from me?
our next d.a. -- i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  did you get your invitation yet?
what was i supposed to do?  when you didn't show up saturday, i tried to call. your phone isn't working.
the truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
all the data banks in artoo are still secure.
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. that's why i need you, case. you're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. my "ice" as you call it. i'm doing everything i can to make that possible.
my real father?  well, he was a flashback.
i want to leave right now.
tell me something. does this usually happen to you, mr. gittes?
well, you be careful with that boy, lula.
anyway i've got to the bottom of the delay. finally. we're waiting for someone from rome.
well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
god, i think josh is too mature for us.
i thought there were too many forks on the table.
are you okay ?
chief knows.
you climb damn it, or so help me i'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
then to the bastille.
what do you remember?
fuck, what the fuck is going on --
not at first.  he was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  he said we had this secret.  and that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... something like that.  i don't know.  it's hard to remember, exactly.
you remember what the doctor tells us.
pon farr. vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
a photographer ...
lemme tell you something. you are the pestilence. i'm the exterminator.
then this is our chance.
it's a special day isn't it?
what word would you use, elaine?
why?
alright. time to ditch this thing. did you take a look at the bathroom window?
i'm getting real tired of this maniac.
you want us to fire a shot if...
...franklin.
i never scared anyone before.
what?!
i want you to come to my house. then we'll talk.
she's in the other room.  i just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. but it's time for her to die now.
-- so you shut them off?
i haven't enjoyed mass this much in years.  what a marvelous program. innovative.  inspiring.  you are to be commended.
don't stop!
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
naw. i'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight. now he's gone.
congratulations.  by crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
to freedom.
which way do you think level two is?
no, that's your problem, frank.  you get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
yes.  it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared.
what i mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
father, i don't understand. tell me what happened?
which means he's having nightmares again?
henryk, i said nothing bad.
no.
goddamn it...goddamn it...goddamn it...
now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
you all want to lay off?  god.  i hope the iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
i'll take you.
how long have you known my father?
then, we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland.
hydrophobia...
if i could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
i leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. like opening out of town, but terrifying. there's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
i already don't like the sound of this.
but, chip...
if ye'd wanted a bloody cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody states!
st. michael's.
please, oh, please, i haven't done anything to hurt you.
many thanks.  you're patterson, yes?  nigel starling- i'll be assisting you at tsavo- but surely beaumont must have told you that.
not yet, mr. clark.
be careful?  you mean you - or me? who?
i don't exactly know. philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
...by you?
so... we understand each other judge?
that's deep --
i think it is.
oh, yes.
that must be him. water taxi.
what do you mean? it doesn't get to look much better than that?
you're heading for trouble, fergus --
imonna find out one way or the other.
exactly what is your previous experience?
hide out for what? we ain't doin' nothin'.
what is it?
...i guess i'm sprouting off again. but i am certain of this, garland: i'm capable of more good work. maybe better work than i did in choirs. it just doesn't seem to me that los angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
go to the northeast corner.  call a cab.  bring the pizza.  then there's a poem.  roses are red, violets are blue, if the pope goes to washington, i would, too.
don't lie to me. i saw her name in the register.
you're tellin' me. i swear, this town has gone crazy.
anything today?
over here.
don't take my word for it, quaid. someone you trust wants to talk to you.
we're a few minutes away.  just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
your honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  including mr. hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
isn't it great how she's resting like that?
'cause we dig ya, man -- gimme a dollar.
this is do-able.
it shan't happen again. i swear it. i'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
no i haven't...
most kids do, i guess.
you know what it takes.
why couldn't you stay here with me?
anya... where are we?
fun though, wasn't it?
i'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
you said --
if they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, elalco! adelante! los clientes esperan!
scully, get somebody to open this door.
tommy, halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. it's all make believe.
rick.  let me tell you.  wait, we're in the...
well, well--  yeah--i got smart and thought i'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. i said, "mr. president, about the monopoly investigation--" and he jumps right in and says, "diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" he had me.
i'm sorry.
i thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
what an hallucination!  oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  oh dearie me.
you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila, so i'm gonna play blue-face with you. 
having fun, kip?
i'm not pregnant.  i'm hot.  i'm too hot.
it's not funny at all. one can't get intimate just off hand. i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said: 'how do you do, mr. preysing! and you said:  'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester'.
no...
what's his name again?
now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.
let's rush him.  he's not going to blow us all up.
gittes.
did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
no.
stalker, huh?
i want to know about exley.
good.
ugh, i hate when that happens.
sulu hikaru.
the numbers are not particularly relevant.  you are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
yeah, but, when i was walking, i realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. he's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? he's not free. he's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
i hope you don't take to bitterness, sister morgan. i tell you like i tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. no matter what the trial or what the misery is, i tell 'em to stay with god.
yeah, well, bleek trusted me. we're best friends.
this town ain't big enough for the two of us!
i thought blockbuster fired you.
why did you tell us he shot everybody, levi? you put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
it's horrible. terrence was one of the most brilliant men i've known.
a man doesn't always mean the things he says.
why'd we have to leave so fast?
no, tell me what's so funny.
it doesn't mention 'females only'
cute nickname, don't you think?
you didn't come here to destroy wintermute. you can to save a man you love. a man who isn't even capable of returning that love. such a waste...
we've never met.
we?  you've taken it?
and when i clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. do you understand?
well, he seems to have bought kissinger.
i never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
god, i wish i could prove you killed everybody.  unfortunately, i know who the real killer is.
i think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
i'm still here.
or believe, i'll bet.
thank you janey.
have a good time.
and a house. valued at 350 thousand.
when is that?
and in you, too, lieutenant.
yeah, but i didn't do anything.
i didn't say that.  well?
what’s this, a signal? will you come whenever i ring it?
juno macguff called while you were out running. she wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday.
what do you care?
haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
i'll put this in the back.
oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy.  i want to take my final vows, i would do it tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let me!
what worries you?
but i have to go back. i brought you here so you'd be safe. from her.
what's what?  oh, that.  just a little going away present.
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door. the young girl in the movie tears off running, screaming, flying through the room.
no, sir. but it wasn't easy... being among them...
tuttle! are you from central services?
who needs it? i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things! i love being a woman because...
what?
janet.
the girl's dead, driscoll. there's no point continuing on.
that's not the case.
oh.
will!
have you visited the little boy on my floor?  jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
i don't think so. this guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
yeah.
yes, we can see some kind of mist. what is that?
that's all right, you know what? you sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
i like ben very much... he reminds me of the old man...
well, unfortunately denning's not here to tell us, but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
yeah.
why don't you come with us.
yeah. yeah. and you know something? i think that i'm starting to get more of your references, too.
i'm telling you...
yes noreen you better had. thank you.
well rose was being very thorough.
no, no, of course not. it's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. so when there was no word from him...
if you could meet god, what would you say to him?
filled? that's impossible! they haven't even seen my work. i need this post. please, can't you help me? please!
i love your sexy talk. it's so... kindergarten: poo-poo; wee-wee.
why me?
"money." so you can get dome money...
sugar?
you weren't passing 'em out.
that is not an acceptable option. if people get hurt, all the support we have in the federation...
so how do you get from the bronx to the south china sea?
is that the walls of jericho going up?
you're out of your mind.
forget it. i should've known better. your friend is just, i don't know, into collecting weird tricks. mind?
hell, you think i am?
ok, how did you know?
i caught you red-handed, mister ambassador.
he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. yet another mistake for "mr. fantastic."
i never lied to you.
i know it was a bad idea to close the store.
did you know him very well?
no, you don't understand -- i don't want to get out!  i want to get in?
different.
how are you, mother?
i don't want a steak.
there's nothing else here.
what am i gonna do?
awful?
not yet.
oh, hi juno. how are you?
of all the times! of all the times! two months to the end of his term-- and foley has to go and die on us--
oh, gruesome. i wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
i'd know it, eddie. i'd know. for god's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? i love you.
keep me off the couch, doc. your fees are a little rich for me.
i want you in dr. gardner's office at nine o'clock.  you're out of control, curran.
this is it, betty.  they'll find us again, fog or no fog.
oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  but you couldn't approach them.  they were a wise bunch of birds.
shit.
but be serious, darling. you are in danger and you must leave paris.
jackie shawn.
okay.
or her, or her - or any of them?
it-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. so-how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once? it doesn't make sense.
they're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
you're being dense, major.  i certainly don't
it's probably the solenoid.  take it back to gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in sicily.
maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. that's why i asked if he was a fairy.
i could take care of her.
asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  she was gonna be a doctor.
what-- when?
she'd get angry.
a telephone call?  that's communication with the outside world!  doctor's discretion.  hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  whackos everywhere!  a plague of madness.  in fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  i'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all i know you're crazy as a loon.  but that's not why you're here.  why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  there's the tv.  it's all right there. commercials.  we are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  what are we for then?  we're consumers.  okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. but if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  you're mentally ill! that's a fact!  if you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  screwdrivers with miniature built-in radar devices, stereo systems with brain implanted headphones, voice- activated computers, and...
uh huh...why?
when you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
she doesn't have anything to do with it!  you understand that? mother?  this is me!
fuck, go to the car... call for backup. tell 'em officer down.
so this guy walks into a bar and says...
homesick?  it's only been two days!
if i'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. narcissus, i should have adopted you years ago.  and now the gods are begging me to make you my son!
none either.  it's bizarre.  it's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out.  nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63.  a man who has defected once already.  it's crazy.
good morning, alexander.  feeling up to some work?
he took your wallet?
anyway, i can say never to high school. i've got david.
yeah.
look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. we'll have dinner -- talk it over.
yeah.
i would have missed it -- but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked.  it looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  it's been erased without any input signal coming in.
this is how you make dinosaurs?
you know you can always talk to me.  right?  whatever is going on in your life, your mom and i'll understand.
how did you know your son was involved?
and he was ripped limb from limb?
oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? i'm the one got hit.
oh dewey, i'm sorry.
there's pepsi in the fridge.
so you got cozy with she who stings?
yeah? what do you want?
i'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
i've got about a half dozen...i'm going to tag them.  you hearing anything?
god, vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
you should definitely have children.  they're really special.
nah.
mr. bernstein, i wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
hey... is betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
scar? never heard of any chief scar.
staying the night here, uninvited.
some reporter i am..all this time my story is right there in front..i have a lot of questions.
they're still on the property. maybe you better stay inside.
i've got a show -- at st. matthew's cathedral.  we're singing for the cardinals.
yes.
just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
exception!
it's your mistake.
away from your crazy mom.
sure, jerry, we're all set. why wouldn't we be?
well i don't know.
you wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  i did dog and pony for you!  you think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the three stooges...
i'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. surely you would agree--
and if i triumph, you triumph.
oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. oh no, i won't wear garters—
you know how to get back to the windmill, right?
but in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. no?
to show you this.  it's a letter from that lawyer, koehler.  he wrote it to me the day after i saw him.  he's the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail.
elaine, i'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
father barry.
there's only six miss dugans now... poor dorothy.
come on -- i'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night i'm going to kill him?  i'd have to be really dumb to do that.
penelope!
what is she, at work?
i know but i....how much is it?
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram?
thirty-four.
you dropped this.
good night?
oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
i don't believe it.
this is good. uhh...
and that's how you got me in the first place.
yeah.
you don't have to prove anything.
time to sleep now, captain.  but you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
try to keep it to a minimum.
god, that's terrible.
let me get up.
what are you talking about?
he's allergic to everything.
we don't even have a dog!
i love you, carmen.
would you look at that, ray. winston up and died on us.
hmmmm?
because he's a bitch.
maybe i better start our homework.
you don't tell us how to run our investigation.  you got that?
huh? move back, baby, i can't see anything.
yeah, hon. real bad. you just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
yah, real good.
hey, mister.  mister.  i just. . . i just wanted to thank you.
you mentioned a guy from l.a.p.d., but you didn't mention the federal.
hey! what are you guys doing in here?
oh-hhh!!! go on, do me in you bastard cowards. i don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
you volunteered for this shit man?
you ever play one of these?
doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
do you know what happened to her?
that's nice.  you thank her for me. go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
i am really, deeply sorry.
i don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
it's nice to see you.
your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
i didn't agree to three points over the vig.- what am i nuts? i didn't need it that much.
i thought you said she didn't say much.
you remember tommy's shines? the kid was great.  he made mirrors.
seven-twenty.
you mean you hauled him all the way out here? just like that?
okay, he's gonna clip israel, i just gotta outta there --
if i throw too hard i'll hurt the kid.
hell, i couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
if you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
i didn't know we had sailboats.
yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, i heard all about that.
you what?
rachel was terrified when i left her.  i could see it in her eyes.
one pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
don't like the feel of it, jack.
call me.
jesus christ, guys. what the hell's khruschev thinking?
something... i've got...you don't.
camera, chucky.  are you bernard laplante, sir?  what is your relationship with john bubber?
that was for my ma. now this is for everybody else.
figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
i suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
she say where he is?
i want to reach people.  nobody listens to me.  this is my way to reach them.
upon my word, sir, i think you have acted very coolly.
look. i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone.

now stay with me, boys. what did they do to make two such identical wounds? did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? no. two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! that's all she fuckin' wrote!

ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey.

joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  you bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
this is one of my dreams, jake. ever since i was a little girl. i never thought it would happen.
lamar burgess thinks that you left john because he lost himself in precrime instead of you.

jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.

save that for the tribune.
what do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
let's make us even, shall we?
it's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
don't give me your black magic bullshit! seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny american boy? do you have a motive?  do you have a weapon? or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
no, not everything? the sun is still shinning. it's a beautiful day out. some things are ok. right?
we must follow that bird.
good, 'cause see, i am a valuable commodity.  i go across the middle. i see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, i tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." that's new york steak, baby.  rare. and yet, nobody's giving me love. nobody's giving me props.  nobody. i went to arizona state, i'm from arizona, i break arizona records, i'm a sun devil, man!!!
do you realize if the women of america would have just heard what you said...
okay.
that's all?
you're so funny...
let's go.
you knew when you came in that the audition was over, that eve was your understudy! playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
m'hm.
well, it you're not gonna ask, then i will. how was it?
it can buy you a new and better you.
well, i have a pat rebuttal for mr. doyle -- that couldn't be mrs. thorwald -- or i don't know women.
i was upstairs with eddie --
give me the book.
new star.  hey, guess what? i got a new star on the readout.
thanks, sidra.
margo. bill is all of eight years younger than you.
yes. as a matter of fact, you failed to mention that gallagher was a girl.
brady! come with us! brady!
no dog.
what's it worth to ya, boss?
pure?
thing is, i'm about out of fuel.
jesus.  twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
what do you mean, your bracelet? it's our bracelet.
go on in.
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross.
i've never lied to him before.  it's the first time he's ever lied to me. he was just as convincing as when he says 'i love you.'
who, me? oh, no! don't bother about me! we're not hurt! isn't that right, skipper?
you sure it's okay with you?
yeah.
yesterday that might've meant something.  pull me off.  you'd be doing me a big favor.
oh, yeah, really, oh!
yeah.
because you're going to help me plan a party.
you notice anything with mikey lately? the kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
so, school going alright?
no, sir ...
chief, look!
my mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
mornin, sister.
you have to have a favorite.
come again?
i told you you wanted to take this call.
shut the fuck up and do what i say!
we're there.
what does he think of your chosen line of work?
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
symington says...
big time. absolutely fucking radge. 'it's me or iggy pop, time to decide.'
i'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
what're you talking about?
it's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
yeah, i'm fine.  i'm off the phone.
what is wrong with you?  what?  you're going away.  you're getting help somewhere.
why? what for?
is this your car?
private.
dude finlay?
all right.
fuck you.  make time.  cause i bust my ass for you.  i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  and what do you do for me?  huh?  you see the way i'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i'm doing?  have you ever bothered saying, hey, erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best god damn employee i've ever had?
i'd hate to get lost on that freeway...
good. -- so our two heroes, adcox and mccaffrey, they go back inside. only there's another fire in there nobody sees. and it took your dad, didn't it brian? did you see him burn?
oh sure... gotta believe in god.  but i don't think god made man in his own image.  no.  'cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  no, i think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of god -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- i slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>booooorring</u>!!!... and so the whole point of life, i think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... not that we have to get married.
look, ted, i don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
is this all we got left?
yeah, i asked him.  i don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in sal's.  he should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
whatever you say, mayonnaise.
what do we do?
you are, you are my only connection to the world!
hello, daniel.

c'est bon, monsieur.
this rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, carl. whatiya burn in this thing, "v"?
hurry!
i believe in you....
but if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
that you?
what i love.
your mother's pastor.
why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
my guess is that she turned him down.
my company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. and i have a wife. suicide would nullify my insurance. murder does not.
well, it's a wide range of, eh --
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.
i'm busy.
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
you were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
no. just me.  me an' her.
i know you. i saw you through the floor, didn't i?
mmm, what. i know better than to argue romance with a french woman.
um, ten-o-five. why? where are you?

straighten up, kid.  i wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  i got a guy named henry gondorff i want you to look up.  there ain't a better insideman alive.  he'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
have you ever been on television?
dude?
in a little while. that's what you want, isn't it?
what about me?
what are you staring at?
who is this girl?
sir, you threw out page two.
here you go, enjoy.
he was out when i was there. if he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
-- listen, i wonder if you kids could give me a ride? i'm kind of stranded here.
friends?  you didn't tell me that.
answer me, why don't you try posing? i'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
i'm trying. i really am...sometimes i don't even know why i came up here in the first place.
they'll probably believe you.  but they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  why mitchell had a gun.  you'll tell them a simple story.  they'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  now you're headquarters.  how does it sound to you?
they're given to the living in memory of the dead.  if this is a real one -- i can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
you're not one of them. there's been a mistake.
you just come in on amtrack?
i'll stay.
...this is nothing.  this is nothing. d'you ever shoot in <u>italy</u>?  try three italian starlets on benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  wonder if i saw him i'd think it was you?
we can't stop him. not now. handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. please andy...
he might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.

it's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
oh my god...we’re buried alive...
jeffrey. jeffrey what?
there are other doctors...yes, other doctors...better doctors...
we were gonna grab some food.
hi, marty!
you could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  tell me the truth --- is it lasher...?  answer me!!
again?
it's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
you talk about ecology -- there it is.
i appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....
you were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. but it amused me to make you ashamed of it. you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i called you names. don't get me wrong, i'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, i never loved you, sebastian. you're just a toy. a little toy i play with. and now you've completely blown it with her. i think that's the saddest thing i've ever heard.  cheers.
absolutely. people, dogs, elephants.
only this isn't a bail bond, max.
buffy, honey?
you are angry, aren't you, mrs. otto?  that's why i'm here.  to give your anger a voice.  to be your
what's the matter? wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  say, how old are you anyway? don't you know these busses work on a schedule? you need a guardian.
a long time ago. you've repaid them many times over. ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
ahhh... why?
didn't seem worried about them.
are you listening to me?
invitation, please.
that girl...you know, beloved...
i'm done, clem. i'm just going to ride it out. hiding is clearly not working.
shut up -- yes you are. now listen to tee. we'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
how did she know nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
newcomers, eh?  names john behan, i'm cochise county sheriff.  just hit town?
'commander' decker?
so it's all worked out perfectly...
of course, you do get the good with the bad.  the new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  wave of the future, dude.  100% electronic.
why not? we don't owe buddy-boy anything.
charlie...
lay off of that stuff, son. it upsets your mother.
you've said that already.
all the more reason to watch him. he's had some wild notions lately.
just let me go.
so what brings you to l.a., bones?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up!  and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for...
like what?  i got a little power, sure. a touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  but no more than you do.  we're not witches.  i can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. besides, maybe they deserve it.  maybe we all do.
well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
i made other plans. you can have both tickets.
oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
you just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
how many in your family?
i am the devil, lester. i think i can handle it.
yeah, well i said i was an idiot. whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
stan? what's going on?
we thought it was just.
yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
you couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and i don't believe you'll destroy me now.
eh? have a drink.
you expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
i love every square inch of it. but i can feel the edges closing in on me. a man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  so what do you say? join me?
if i knew i wouldn't have to ask. what did you do? i was happy the way it was.
what did that man mean when he said you were... .?
what man had access to her?
there's no one "looking at you" .. there's hardly anyone in here. the only person looking at you, is me.
major dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
okay, forget him now.  i'm going to pick up sean.  take a ride?
nurse! nurse!
how're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
you realize the things you're saying, willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
turn it off.
don't thank me, just do it. you're the slots manager. i shouldn't have to tell you this.
oh, i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when i lived down in the quarter.
they got us sealed. what are we gonna do?
wait a minute, i think i know who stole it.
eyes bloodshot. must have been staring out the window for hours.
got your ticket?
...ah...
he's the devil's child...
where are you going?
really?  cool.  tell him his subs are great.
where is your mother?
my air isn't... i'm coming back.
you'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  until you are returned to spain where you will be judged. have you anything to say?
oh, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to wake you.
but the first time i saw you was in the elevator.
hi, nikki. this is mike again. could you just call me when you get in? i'll be up for awhile, and i'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
why, that's just sense, son. now a man like daniel webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. but he's worth it -- and he helps others. makes all the difference.
excuse me, may i please use your phone?
sam is sam. he's taking up fly fishing. he's in a yert in montana.
i was in the fish-market play. what happened to him?
the taste of defeat is bitter, no?
we want the man who did this --
when did you umm, i mean umm...
hey, man, you know that in switzerland--and this country's the size of east l.a., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? fifty-four!
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  and this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
i'm the ebay boy, remember? i can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
any trouble?
yeah, they're confused.  they can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
what will you do after the war?
he's gotta be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.
a rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
ah, my dear francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
no one broke into this room, sir. someone broke out.  that lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
but you don't understand.  she'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
mr. concannon...?
how do they know it's over?
well i assure you, sir, i have no desire to create difficulties. 45
i don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
weren't we supposed to?
nothing like a little liveliness.
cramped.  you always drink like this, so early in the morning?
you mean forget?
i wish i could tell you. i can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. i'll notify the cdc and --
you really do believe in destiny?
i want ice!  who's got some--  oh, there it is.
oh, i have some suntan lotion.
from now on, we'll share marla. we've been spending too much time apart...
some people do it to be funny
it's in all the afternoon papers. i'm very sorry.
that's great. i'm thirty-five years old. just over six feet tall. i weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
a little bunny i saved from dissection.
what did you think of that wadja film?
don't be foolish. if it's true, they'll have to accept it.
he's dead.  i was just there. somebody slit his throat.
mckinney's the name.
we are what we are.
but maybe you know someone who does. an austrian, in london, dealing in kids and snuff videos. how many can there be? these people supply to order. he has to be known, reachable.
well he isn't... and he won't die... tell me he won't die!
stop brushin' me back!
michael, give us a lift.
thank you very much, your excellency.
hello? you there?
i been watching you.  you done good. invested wisely.  respectable businessman now.  just like you always wanted.
you'll never believe who's in there.
harold, calm down! this is...
is that what you're asking me? is there something wrong with anything?
i mean, not that it didn't give evelyn the kind of coronary i had in mind, just...
i heard about your little misadventure yesterday, miss connell.  on your first "day off," too.
she never should've set foot on this ship. this is your fault!
sid —— no!!!
yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
what do you want me to do? our people need me.
"lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. where are the lifeforms-"
if anything ever happens to me...
no, thank you.
thanks.
you won't disconnect.
but mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  it has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
yeah.
... hey, i don't need your charity ...
could it be intelligent?
the police, then...
mph rmph rm!!
how did you know that?
you're back.  what happened?  never mind.  what's going on?
thanks a lot, that was the best. you're next.
you can't trace my holographic emitters, captainn. so don't bother. and you can't contact starfleet. we're quite alone.
no -- keep it.
what's kirshner?
i done it again.
where are you staying?
we're going to europe next week.  i want to get passage booked on the queen.
check the scrawl.
nice to feel needed.
sorta room-mates?
that place is already bad luck.
i don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn't have. and yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. and that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
oh, mr. jason. i really shouldn't be doing this, you know. it's against the rules.  when did you say you wanted them?
i want the rest of the pictures.
the others already told me, o'neil. they wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  because you went soft on another women --
no.  no... don't go yet.  i feel as if i... i don't understand you. and i want so much to understand.
last night's as much my fault as yours.  if he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
any rotation?
it is over.
yes.  dahmer!  and after that...
it's gonna be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
i don't know, i think he's funny.
'but how do i know you love me?'
this is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
we're not stranded.  we've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
the boss called. arthur fell ill.
"cecil stipe." find it.
i didn't want to go. i was too nervous. i thought, maybe you were a nut. but you were exciting. you called from upstairs.
did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
i know, but--
...yes...?
i remember.  hi roberto!
you got it, sweet pea.  nice boonies, seeger.
tomorrow at ten at the prefect's office.
he's floating.  take it home.
sir?
wait a minute. what does the chairman do?
thank you, jack.
yes, james.
fine.  i'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
i know - that's what i said too. anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
and that's when the mets started to stink.
martin. it was a beautiful role. all i had to do was find the character's center, the stem i'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
i don't think he knows how.
so when was i here?
but i got you out. didn't i, doc. i did it. i got you out.
ryan, you've got to come!  you've got to help me find the dog!  i let their dog out.  we need to find the dog.
about what?
why haven't you called?  why don't you answer your phone?
pop! that was my card!
price didn't make the guest list... the house did. it wants vengeance.
and you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
you look awful.
ouch.
maiden name -- daniels.  you know her?
i got sent.
you're a mug, clive. we did our bit in the last lot.
ted, there's no time to explain.
funny, i've never been a talker. my wife was always getting on me about that.  'say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  i never would though.  not really.
if you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
where is he? where is rob?
cinderella man! that's sensational, babe! sensational!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
interested in local curios?
ask it.
third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  mr. pearlstine used it as an office.
and then one day, he didn't come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo containers don't just fall on people. he was murdered... after that i fell apart. i dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. when my mother died i hit bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and i knew what i had to do.
a p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
no. the albacore. it's a fish. my grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
i gotta catch up with him, laurie!
...feels like you.
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation.
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
if these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. my father worked at bluestar for twenty-four years. i gave 'em my word.
respond with static. let them think we're having difficulty. which wouldn't be far from the truth.
i fucked up.
all right, i'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as i can.  and you understand that this is a big secret? just between us?  okay. you know i've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
i will not be scrogged.  i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
i think you're on the right track.
somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
i guess. his parents are. he doesn't care about that.
no, no of course not.  it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.
thanks.  who are you?
they never do.
what about?
isn't there another route? so we can by-pass all this?
what are you up to?
there is no kirby enterprises, is there?
what the hell is botox?
uh ...
it's from both of us.  of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
he's my father.
but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  same old reed, the hopeless optimist. still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
dinner at the white house.
you a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. where did you read that?
i want to have a look around before i take you.
diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... brothers should be raised together, colon.  even brothers from different mothers...
marge? where are you going?
you know where to look for your austrian, right?
you see, a tree is a living thing.
shut up. i like the kid.  remember the night he took farella at st. nick's, charley. we won a bundle. real tough. a big try.
i told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. for you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
my wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window i saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  so, consigliere of mine, i think you should tell your don what everyone knows.
sailor?
it's a damn good role.
it's happening again. just like my parents. a monster comes out of the night. a scream. two gunshots. i killed them.
i got no ears! i can't hear!
he needs to hire an attorney.
no you can't. it... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf.
that's too bad.  you would have been the first one in the family.
okay.  then i'll go.
kruger, sagittarius.
if i'd gone public with this yesterday annette michaels might be alive today.
we write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
i'm trying to help, duff.
... third bay area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  lt. thomas quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
you speak french.
who?
i think i can lick it.
well, is that really true? i mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
what happened?
trade. okay. the photographs... for a straight answer.  who are you? and how do you know zephram?
i've considered that possibility.
huh. but it's still a story without an ending. what about now?
no.  not after that night.  i don't know what happened.  maybe he caught her with some john... all i know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... indian kid named davy.  used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. him and suzie were at the glades that night.  it was right after that, ray got suzie busted and sent her away.  that's what there is to say about ray duquette.
so what can i get you?
dr. gruber...
because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and i just hate her she's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now. why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? i mean, it's okay and everything, but i don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
john book, i would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with samuel as possible.
what's the delay?
now, sir... we did take care of that user you sent us --
you guys had better leave us a...
enterprise to reliant. come in, reliant.
i want to be alone --

laser fail-safe. you can't get the code wrong... it slags you. i can't let you try it.
i don't think so.
this part removes the sense of humor.

better try a little higher.
can you walk? puedes caminar?
can we see the scene with the music back, please?
all the carvings.
let me use your phone.
your wife?
there's nothing like it. i saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. come -- try a nip!
not to my knowledge. privacy is a great concern to my customers. but, if you say this is an fbi matter...
are we going to eat or what?
i don't give a shit.  split it up.  have a great life.  i'm done.  i'm out. starting over.  cheers.
how can you tell?
larry!
laura?  are you okay?
then gimme buddy shaw -- he's ranked fifth.

oh yeah?  like how little?  in case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  listen, kid, i can't pass this up -- she looks like marilyn monroe.
i don't follow.
my hair's getting wet!
where you goin'?
i can't leave now.  don't ask me to explain!  i just can't!
all right -- where's the letter?
didja tell 'em anything else?
i would like to get paid now.
patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but - idiot! - i believed you!
that's it?
it's far too dangerous.  zordon would never allow it.
i don't deserve haagen daz.  i'm a horrible person.
you should come to rehearsals.  i know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
right.
no.
can i ask you about melanie?
they charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
where does he work?
gosh.  that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  they certainly take their lives in their hands.  what with the weather and all.
it's going.  it's going.
so why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
bobby?

i told the truth!
one of your instincts?
your highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
hey. where's monkeybone?
no! that's not all there is to it! i love you, too--i *know* i do.
... yeah.
here we are.  yeah, that's a possibility.  a movie.  now you gwan in, tell your mother i got you back on time.  point that out to her. she was always on my case for stuff like that.  she's still like that, right?
what?
what did gordon's tie mean?
a plague o' both your houses.
all right, y'all gonna go with me?
now, ben, i won't have any of that. why don't you listen to your good friend chauncey this is a time to think of life!
most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
i see. well, shall we start with the engine room?
sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
i've made the scene.
it's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
no, we're just going down.

you followed me.
park avenue and east 2nd. take centre to canal, up the bowery, cooper and third, left on 41st, come around on park.
the mets. so anyway, chalk up another 180 g for the game. jesus christ! that's almost half a million dollars. ariane! wait. that's not good enough, i'll ask the shithead for 280 g for the kids. then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. yeah. perfect. 280 g for the kids. yeah, it's good i prepared, or i wouldn't have thought to --
your name?
didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
i want you.  to tell the truth.
you're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
we must take action on this immediately.
no. this war is almost over.
dr. fell is studying for his examination by the studiolo.
don't you throw up on boat?
no.
i look terrible.
of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
...and you're even lovelier than i pictured. i brought a birthday present for mr. gekko.
looks like she was holding out.
is there going to be a later...?
tom, i never had trouble getting credit from you before. when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted. now i come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
yes, it really causes problems. sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  but if it's too much trouble, i understand ...
a sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
yeah.
he is a porter. he wants to carry them.
you...um...you never got married?
mr. king, i think --

the entire wing?
i can't.
you've got a fruit loop in your hair.
you know what i want.
a man in a suit with a slim build. tall.
what do you think?
i've watched you - on verandahs, at garden parties, at the races - how can you stand there?  how can you ever smile?  as if your life hadn't capsized?
no shortage of suspects.
a right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
then what are we doing sitting around yapping? let's eat!
that must've been twombley. jesus. i bet that was twombley.
i ju- well, it's a nice pen. i just didn't know whose it was. i thought it was yours. i didn't want it to get lost.
why?
i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!
missed.
how are we doing?
let's go niggers!
all right... i didn't have lunch with jennifer.
isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  do you have to rub my nose in it?
i know exactly what you mean. today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the sec. all they want to do is regulate our natural growth! it's happening across the country!
the examination is a normal function.
this has always been my favorite time of day.
i'm sorry. don't hate me.
this says "invitation only".
why do you need a chain like that?
yeah.  some clown at schrafft's 57th street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
this is kind of a cool place.
how's your mother feeling?
mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
what happened to the singing? you're not in a show, are you?
you come highly recommended, carter. and your particular assignment requires a special talent.
mace!  you're a life-saver.

that's a lot of butler.
it's ok, it's alright. i'll come right back, i'll just go pay for my car.
or are you too scared?
no, stay.
this is where it happened. right over here.
hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
howdy, squire! howdy! oh -- how do you do, squire.
what has happened?
cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up broadway.
only in a very general way.
to find the man in black, obviously.
so, are you a cheerleader?
we'll be okay. i want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
i don't know.
and video games after!
okay.
all right!  am i exceedingly dangerous now?
it is that.
jackie?
how you feeling?
i left my phone number in your undies. try not to lose it in traffic.
they gave me two weeks. i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
fuckin' one-ball.
i... i had a visitor.
what's the matter?
yeah, i know. to that girl who moved to pittsburgh.
what's the matter with your voice, commander?
mr. mystery guest.  are you still there?
telephone? the gunthers across the valley. they're mennonite. they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
see anything?
something happened to them, mon.
torque wrench please.
most men are.
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
they're only trying to scare you, that's all.
say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
no.
listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
hello, jean-pierre.
all i know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
quite. any childhood friends? enemies?
jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
hiding him where?
wait a minute.  wait a minute.  i just got here.  you sweep.  i betcha sal asked you first anyhow.
you sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
goddamn it!
-- what is it.
can't let you in...  sorry.
yes!
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
why are you always talking about we? there is no we. there is a me, there is a you. but there is no we between us.
will you two cut it out?
oh, paul, can i read each chapter when you finish? i can fill in the "n"s.  will she be her old self, now that ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia?
ooo, i'm sure mrs. caldwell will love that.
i  have complete faith in you. but don't you go speeding.
get up!!
i'd like to help you, rebecca. but all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
"we"?
he's this way.
very fancy.  did you design the bottle?
plan b is your dad.
coffee?
can i ask you something?
well, yes.  he's your lawyer too.
your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday, she's available.
i'll pick you up in...
hands on the wheel.  ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
but you didn't.
jesus...
have to hurry back.
he's happy, darlin ..
annie:  you stick to the amateur theatricals.  this isn't quite the same thing, you see?  this is big business, in which, our life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
i don't want to read.
where're we going?
hi. frank... coming in, please.

of course - iím sorry to hear you say that claire.
what do you think, lou?
thank you, baron.
check, all bomb circuits green.  okay, lothar.
i don't believe i've seen you at any of our services before.
well, i guess it's getting late. please thank kathryn for the use of her steinway.
don't worry, i owe you a lot. i'm not gonna let us rot here. i'm gonna find us a way out.
come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
a what?
an excellent quality.
just go check the temperature.
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, mr. torrance. somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
i'll be away a lot.
shut down?
yeah, just a lung full of new jersey.  lucky you showed up when you did.
it wasn't just you, bunny.
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco. of course, they're mostly hoods.
no. judge -- just a sec. but marylin, if we sign it, i can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
is it ... is it, really?
so could you!  is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. i'll understand.
you're on vacation, remember?  you're supposed to be relaxing.
i could stand some more--

china.
kay, we weren't expecting you.  you should call...
take your paws off me!
eddie!  you scared the hell out of me!
...leaving tomorrow, sir.

he may have a point, lieutenant. two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
honey... you all right?
alexander??? please? you're my advisor, advise me!
you're a good man... she was right to have chosen you...
*but you never asked me*!
fine.
she spoke?  susan spoke?
she's good enough for me! and if i was to go home and tell my wife --
my god! the bumstead contracts!

and what happened to von der nul?
talk to me.
what do you guys do?
why didn't his niece slap your face?
wow. they called you their son.

...and is that serious?
nick! nick, you'll kill him!... easy. nick, easy! hey, hey. vince goes back a long way.

i can't work in a vacuum. why don't you make hendricks chief? his family's been here since the puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
it needs a hat.  there was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
jenkins ain't no boss.  mean we're gonna let people like jenkins stay here?

arrrgh!
maybe we should just leave --
no --
good night, jacqueline -- good night, mary.
deepcore, deepcore... this is cab three on final approach.
there'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
then what goes on in there?  what i mean is, what are you thinking about?
i'm hungry.
you're not lenore oberfeld.
leave her alone --
how's kip?
through the power of the simple word---
you're sure?
it's not funny now. i'm a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make. i'm not a kid anymore. you change.
the sheriffs will take over when they get here.
been drinkin' today?
i don't know how to walk in heels.
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
oh, yeah, i love those. yeah... those are funny...
.. nothing.
we've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  while the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about truman himself.  no scripts, no cue cards.  it's not always shakespeare but it's genuine.  that's how he can support an entire channel.
'we will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
you won't keep growing at this rate.
is that better?
what?
fine. i'll go straight.
so what are you gonna do tonight, marty?
no, mr. lowery... but then she's always a bit late on monday mornings.

you disappeared on me. how long you staying?
yeah...beautiful. what would you call that paper there? kind of a...robin egg blue color?

he was a cool one, that harper. never broke.
is it snowing?
hey, you!  better get outa here!
i forgot that rose will lie like a child. she's no more pregnant than i am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
all these years, happy as we've been, how i prayed and prayed he'd see fit to give us a child. and just when i finally accepted my bitter lot...  no one must ever know.
you're mine, you know.  i made you.
this is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.

now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
screw the pem...what about al...
marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
you eat it. you know what this stuff tastes like?
gone!? why would i have the kiss tick...?
i think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
no, i'm gonna quit!
he's dead? that's fine. you won't see me shedding any tears over him!  oh george, you must take me with you!
no one thinks you're a piece of shit, tommy.
don't count on it.  i happen to like nice men.
yes, jimmy.
bates' motel.  he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... go on, sam.
what for?
please get to your father and send him and the police to dorothy's apartment right away. be sure your father comes. something is happening over there. they're hurting someone, the guy she loves. tell them to hurry. i'm going over right now.
may i help you, master grayson?
you invited me.
i've never seen anybody punch clyde before.
where's the light switch?
i'm just saying i think if we met under different circumstances...
oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. they work for free. and you are a volunteer executive producer.
maybe i want to die. don't you want me to die?
you ask her!
it's time for you to leave.
what do you mean most, why not all?
my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
what's in your socks?
i am not!  fuck you!  theo's a genius.
that'll be thirty-eight cents.
are you kidding?!  you wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  you don't see that?!
what?
well i'm the doctor. i'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
you know me with girls. easy come, easy go. goodbye, doc.
but you said...
look, i got a rule.  i don't talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
hi.
you never talked to me like that - in all these years.
who's miss johnson?
no.  i'm just being friendly.
there's jan and heather. let's grab them quick before someone else does.
what's wrong?
i'm sorry, sir.  you okay?
now, who are all these people?
yes.  my psychiatrist didn't insist that i stay on my medication.
hi.
you gonna steal my truck?
sir, that's a field job. it's outside the scope of my assignment. and i've got a test tomorrow on -
i'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i'm working and take me out of there.
tortuga?
look, i've got a lot of problems and i'm trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me.
you were going without saying goodbye?
landing zone is extremely hostile. come down on this transmission !
what are watchin' this junk for?
i don't know how you're used to doing things, marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
you try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  i've never understood that.  what's next?
a mistake.
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, tony walked me home from school. he was my first boyfriend.  i was fourteen.
whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
well, what's it look like now?
he could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
i'm, uh, not sure... feeling kind of weird actually.
i know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
i feel something.  it's faint, but...it's there...
fuck!
big –– see! i don't want one for one night. i want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad, samarkand . . . a great big one.
no, i do. that's what i'm saying to you.
no, i'll go. you stay... in case she wakes up.
she was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872.  one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel, the dei gratia. as the crew of the dei gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste. on boarding, they found her completely deserted. the captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. the table was even set for dinner. and in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
yeah?
oh yeah... maybe... seymour's going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls, so i can hear how bad it went.
how did you get the fucking number?
cuter again.
there ain't no *almost* about this stuff, homer--ain't that right?
this psycho can.
so all that bullshit about god and faith.
that's just plain silly. your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. it's no good, man. you gotta get out there. the ladies want to love you, baby.
my subscription lapsed three years ago...
whatya talking?  i'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  clean as a --
so why didn't we?
no, good sisters are rare. we need every one. tell me something: how tall are you?
look at you... you want to go.
did you?
out of the window, i guess -- i didn't see him.
i'm in from new york.  i came to see swann.
i don't agree.  why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
i don't know if we could take one in with rhonda and me at home alone at times.
sorry it took me so long on the phone. but we're all set.
calm down everybody.   we're just here to negotiate general sarris' surrender.
and i'm a republican.
i changed my mind.
death.  death. without taste, sound and all around us.  because there is no way for me to save them or myself. this is one giant death trap.
you're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
she's fine.
i'm pretty naive? look at you. you have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? nothing.
pig woman agreed to take a test.

milwaukee, madison, dubuque, peoria, st. louis, indianapolis, cincinnati, toledo and detroit.
suleiman!
she won't even see me, pitts.
who's that?  quick -- i'm in love.
of course it makes me mad. it makes me more than mad. just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. but what's it gonna do for me to find them now? i can't fix everything in three days.

that's it, you look like a professional.
i wish the game still had fights so i could bitch-slap wayne.
attractive...
this is his fiancee.  who's this?
he was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
did someone save me?
i can't get over what those guys did to her. i just can't.
i missed you. it wasn't any fun up there with just lois and superman. they're so boring. let's go do something wild!
what's that?
god protect me.
is god merciless? greedy and cruel?
listen -- i don't even know your name.
what do you think he's doing?
you understand i knew harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
pearl dotes on him.
it's on the tenth floor.
your name is al...
in fact, in fact, in fact, i'm not sure if i'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  that's the truth.  the truth's best, don't you think?
oh - tell me ellen, i can call you ellen?
heather?
you know as much about it as i do. i haven't seen him in three months.
he works at a bank.
-- is not a challenge. i need something i can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
what?
really, sail, i'll be okay.
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
you're too fucking late.
the users...you really think they're still there?
yes sir.  we were just talking about that.
what do you mean?
can't i stay a little longer?
where are you from, henrietta?
shut it up!  shut the little bastard up!
it's not his fault!
how many bedrooms will your house have?
by "they" you mean the white house, don't you?  your buddy from usc, dwight chapin-- he works for the white house.
did you meet the president?
we finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  where's pike?
i think you know.
yes, mr. webster -- it was here where it all began.
this is just a test.  the big one comes later.  be careful with that though, it's all i got.
another step and he's dead!
did i say that? i didn't mean it, or did i?  sometimes i think it would be fun.  go ahead, you better leave now. i can't open myself to you now. i'll tell you a little secret.  i want to die.
he's not at his station.
am i in trouble or something?
what do i do?
no thanks, i don't smoke.
you okay ?
it's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  sickos never scare me.  at least they're commited.
if your duty requires it.
my lady!
you did it! you made it. i'm a painter, too.
what?
awake? what do you mean?
i really want that watch.
if they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
you've lost interest...you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
you first.
i want you to settle on their terms.
where is my lady's lord?
solid alibis. he was with sidney when she was attacked.
that's not true.  i never met anybody named oswald.  anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
so i hear you have a girlfriend.
yes.  you see, the truth is, trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  but it's not here. it's in the matrix.
-- where'd you go?
you serious?
his name was arturo marquez. a petty smuggler out of argentina. he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking. he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach. they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. get this - edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
it's a bluff, vince.
which means i gotta fence it for two. who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
hi.
how'd you know?
you go set down by the river.
i'm very good at research.  i'll help you.
he must like shelly, i never saw him hit anyone in his life.
one pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.

dogshit. worse yet, they don't care.
one week at the most!?
it's been five minutes and i'm packing to leave again.  i can't believe this.
heat is not heat! there's different kinds! and this heat is much hotter than what they got in michigan. you go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
miss price, the other nurse that attended you.
tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
you taking extension classes, mr. jameson?
and how's your job?
what happened?
good lord.  so the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
i know that.
andy usually just sends those to the national media. the local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway.
will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
what kind of trouble?
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny. think of it like a movie. you can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. understand?
what's so funny, cadet cowan?
romeo is…italian. always in and out of love.
there's nothing crazy about that, is there?
i been drivin' since i was twelve.
all right, go ahead!  we go on to the next plane. bring out any people that are left.
that's the idea. i'll think about it.
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. it may take a few days, but you're going back.
are we goin' home, john?
you know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? like your eyes can open a little bit more.
i'm sorry, momma.  maybe next time.
your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
which one's your building?
that's right, you did.  have you made any friends there?
my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan.
who's going? us?
right.  and they know him.  and that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
i'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
i know!
yes, ma'am.
what are you doing here?
does it bother you to hear?
if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
where are you at least?
did you see anyone else down here?
what did they argue about?
on mondays and wednesdays, i work for the travelers' aid. at the airport.
i still don't understand how you knew del was telling the truth.
this is terrible, sir -  i hope you're not badly injured...
bad news?!
i'm getting too old for this shit. one oh four and counting.
this is joe white.
my secret?
he boosted the jag?  is that all?
i will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  meanwhile... i'm going to compiegne.
all i can tell you sam, is hang in there.  they clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
i'll sleep around a little.
i really do think it's the best night of my life.
no cooking while you're here...no washing dishes...no cleaning....
wait a minute! how'd you know dieter was coming here?
did you not enter this country illegally?
fucking great...you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
come on, paula! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! or the class before that!
well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
for a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
good on you, then, rafe mccawley.  we'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
who am i?
slow down. smell that?
i know. it doesn't make any sense. that's why i trust it.
why me?
how many aces are left?
ms. tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
the man. he's here.
i know...
i'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
show me the other one again.  i like them both.
you remember that story?
well, i hope the boy pulls through. we should know in the morning.
who is he?
can i buy you dinner sometime soon?
“not yet...”
did something happen to make you care about reality?
thanks, cleo.  see you tomorrow.
thanks, beckett. i'm real excited about it.  what can i do for you?

well, i believe you when you say you go to school.
what do we have here?  a lovely new supply of venom.  i'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
lots of people. guy like evan twombley, boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. the government's been investigating his links with the mafia.
kay-em we made it!
that hair will have to go.
hmm.  primitive ventilation.
i understand. i saw the dress. i...i'm sorry.   are you all right?
mr. jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with mr. delgado?
you know i'd tell you if i had it.
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, jean-luc. we've destroyed forty-seven borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for earth. can you handle it?
cunt. scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
no.
the door's the only way out!
tom?
does the yardman come today?
ted! what are you doing? you can't fly this plane!
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
i mean in new york.
cosmo?
he's a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.
sort of.
she finds him.
those are all from the fair last year.  abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
you think they're connected?
i'm getting angry.
buffy?
hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: barry the baptist.
i had a nightmare one night and i didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  i think that was the first time.  does that count?
jim, spock, jim. remember...?
where?
i suppose you want to know where i'm going to kill tonight, peter?
could you tell me where you were last night?
what the fuck was that about?
you idiot!  asta! stop that!  get down!  now, stay there.
sid, give her back!  give her back now!  i'm telling!
i just want to know where she's staying.
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston.
see, now you've annoyed her.  you know she doesn't like you to touch me.  does she, widdle wee fing!  wuhve you so much!  did you feed her?
so. is he any good?
why not you -- jean d'aulon?  the only man who's poorer than i am, and so the only man i can trust. dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
i do.
something i guess i can't have anymore.
if i were sitting where i normally sit, i would say "calls for speculation."
summers are short here, annie. there isn't much of a fall. before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
i got all i could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 march 50 calls. average price of $47 a share and $4 per contract for the call. i just wish i could've got more.
wait, fred, what about your thing, you know... "digitize me, sergeant chen!"
why does it never work out?  you and...men?
what kind of cop were you before this?
&quot;yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; i am a sincere man, from the land of the palms...
when arthur built the castle, i carved out a place for myself, where i could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
i don't know no buzz fazeli.
that's always your privilege, sir.

you're looking worried again, helena?
casey? casey?
i think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
what's going on, harry?
anybody hurt?
you really think he wanted to kill you?
that's not what i'm talking about.
the empire considers this a matter of internal security. we regret you've become involved.

hildy!
good night, sir.
fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, albert! i mean, what do you think?
let's concentrate on my smarts. pierce patchett made you, didn't he?  he taught you how to dress and talk and think and i am very impressed with the results.  but i need some answers and if i don't get them, i'm going to take you and patchett down.
you're loosing your cool
you goin', mom?
you mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? what'd you say?
like diamonds, huh?  i never get over it. when i was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  she'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, i don't know, it was like she really believed it.

lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
jesse?

...thank you.
rumors? rumors? since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.

so what?  this victim...
lonesomeness is something you take. you bear? dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
well done.
... make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail.
if we get with a counselor. at the church, maybe they's...

i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, drew.  forgive me.  i want you to know i value your advice.
sir?
there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
but you told me to look in the paper!  you told me i'd be perfect!
remember what we talked about?
now that's a lock.
i am impatient with stupidity. my people have learned to live without it.
dollars.
your civil rights?!  you tried to rob me!  i could arrest you right now! you're lucky you're walking away from this.  now get outta here.
he's right, we can't rescind defcon 2. the soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
are you going to the party tonight?
a blue shirt, perhaps?
hmm?
it's okay.  these are police.  <u>what</u> do you want?
sell it to him.  you get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  i got a job, nice apartment.  i do okay.
you'll like it fine.
it's aaron.
we're not allowed to tell a dirty joke hail, hail, freedonia
right.  so.  you must have an enormous record collection.
ok. mark that down.
this is u.s. aerospace command vessel lewis and clark, hailing event horizon, event horizon, do you read...? this is the lewis and clark, hailing... 
unhappy combination.  most likely one's inside the other.
it's in pretty deep.
we've met before, haven't we?
i need one hundred thousand dollars.
meet col --
no sir, the hotel is full because of the diving championship.
yes.
you're kidding.
i hate people who try to peddle comfort. but,mary, you shouldn't mourn for jacqueline. life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. it's better this way.
will it?
what were your parents like?
it's nick! i know that guy. i know him!
yeah.  great.
but don't pull that again.
good.  that way i'll see more of you... where are you going to stay?
it clearly is why.
oh -- i didn't tell you... i've seen dr. corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  he has had excellent results with the waters of plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. apparently, he sent madame le floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
who's gun is that?
we haven't got a lead...
aren't you even curious?
we can't take a second more.
i gotta be fucking crazy.
pari persu; what the fuck is pari persu...?
shep, sit...sit! so, i understand you've got a real emergency down there.
i just don't excite you at all... i don't know what you want... i don't know what you like...
pony, oh my god!
there they are!
yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  and, frankly, i'm glad.  for steve's sake, i'm glad, not yours.  i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart.  steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
no.  but i covered it up.  i lied.
spock...  what have you done to my friends?
congratulations.
this is nothing. ...piece of cake.  y'know, producing is being a samurai warrior.  they pay you, day in, day out, for years, so that, one day, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training at its peak, and save the day.
where do i put ashore?
with all respect, sir, i discovered that portal. its my livelihood.
now this is just a signature card.
act natural.
huh?
no, you don't want to go down there. i am going down there. and i'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
you keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
i'm serious.  the burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
oh mama, i'm so... tired of that song.
we think someone is here.
mike's our attorney general down here.  i was just explaining to jeff, they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
i mean if he was dead, i could handle that.
as soon as i heard about it, i called you.  this thing is big! his arms indicate big.
where exactly?
you're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
he's a very sweet man.
yes, mister harding?
they're blaming it on you.  christ, conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, eric.
i think i'd probably like the apple business.
jack!
how appropriate.
i don't buy it. it doesn't make sense.
well?
honey, church will be fine.
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
the fucking rapists, man. the punks who raped that nun. the $50,000 reward from the church! remember?
the engine is still running.
frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
here you must be in proper attire.
don't be a baby. you're tougher than that.
why do you want to know?
no, no, that is uhmed singh, the present maharajah's late father.
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... do you ever think about stuff like that?
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now.  my father is an ironmaster.  as was i.
okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
but i don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
no, judy, you don't understand.
ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
hedy lamarr?
can you describe her? how old was she?
in a box under my seat.
i feel like we've been at war, charles.
and i'm gonna use the movies when i give my report. jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
i can't say i do. what is it?
who?!
these supplies...?
i agree.
thank you.
no, i don't think so... i was having a nightmare. wait a second...
how wonderful, darling.  what does that mean for you?
i don't think you understand me, court composer.
where' you goin'?
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
blast! a thousand miles off course. well, i was rushed. there was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. the foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. what did he expect?
a blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
their next target.  the name is neo.
come gentle night. come loving black-browned night give me my romeo. and when i shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. o, i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though i am sold, not yet enjoyed. o, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
yo!
maybe three, four times.  i always asked freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  things have been so smooth the last ten years...
you wonít regret this, sir.
i'm not a thief.
what?
back east in newport, rhode island, they call 'em the fall river debs. in pensacola, the mobile debs. in norfolk --
what are you doing?
it's stanley, sir.
let's consummate our fiendish union!
have your children been deaf since birth?
spare me.
big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
there's jenkins' wife. you don't see her on no picket line.
you.
thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
what do i do.  i'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. an annoyance to my superiors. a joke among my peers. "spooky," they call me. spooky mulder. whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. that our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
don't make me laugh, schultz!
was there a priest?
we went out a few times. we didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
no.
yes -- very, very big!
you callin' him a liar?
how many of them are there?
would you like a drink?
that's not true. some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. just not anybody in this car. but lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
jack, these are quite good! really, they are.
mm-mm.
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  i'd better come along and show you the town.
yes.  they're moving him.  i don't know where yet.
shit! david, what is that?
did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
your research laboratory is most impressive...
i can feel it from them! they want to know who made us, what became of him. they have their rules, their idiotic rules!
i'm just flesh and blood, baby. that and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  but you already know that.  you read my fortune.  thanks for the lemonade.
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  i could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
good afternoon.  i'm glad to see you up and around.
hi. hi. hi, there my pee and em. all three look up startled.
this isn't a joke. your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. i'm trying to help you.
that's what i am.
what do you make with that?
let's talk about it later.
anything rated higher than a p.c.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. it'll self- destruct.
operator.
charles, i tell you there is no war! there's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
oh.
we should have asked for cabin one... the one mary was in.
here i am. i... i want to thank you for what you did. not just for... for pulling me back. but for your discretion.
linda. that girl looks just like pat benatar.
<u>she</u> didn't try to conceal it.
you got any kids?
so what?  what could be important enough to put your hands on me?
just an observation.
that storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. we're going to have to cut the tour short, i'm afraid. pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
oh no. you’ll have to do better than that, mr lombard.
we are in desperate want of a mercutio, ned, a young nobleman of verona
i thought you were asleep.
what with taxes coming up - and since i'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, i've been thinking...
how much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
i'm a man. she's, you know, a woman.
that's all right.  we have no secrets from our readers.  mr. thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, mr. bernstein.  he knows what's wrong with every issue since i've taken charge. what's the cable?
even i have trouble with that sometimes. earth is in outer space. and we're in inner space.
why'd you apologize?
hey, are you guys still there? what's going on?
i don't think this is any time to be funny...
hello peter, so good to see you.
so, i've got to drop the van off.
you think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
don't worry, i'll get some more.
i think you'd better leave now.
say matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
two or three nights.
you've got your ten levels, right? here they are...  each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  first one's the blood red sky, then you've got the blue desert, tower of ghosts, kingdom of the blind...  on each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  if you're too late, the screamer comes.
do you really mean it?
nope.
chewie's right.  we must try to save han.
so there is. you don't want to go to bed. i don't want to go to bed. let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
that's not technically accurate - simpsons murders weren't sexually motivated.
why?
kill them all. get rid of them. messy animals.
hello bud, i'm lisa, a friend of gordon's.
you saying the democrats bugged themselves?
that's why you're staying aboard. i'm sorry, will.
you really... didn't have anything to do with what del was doing, did you?
in some fashion -- and i lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from earth's future into earth's past.
what are the notes?
but i don't know what's going on.
isn't there something you want to tell me?
excuse me, mr. treves, sir.
seriously, when i left, i joined the army and took the service exam. they found my psych results fit a certain profile. a certain "moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... i was loaned out to a cia- sponsored program. it's called "mechanical operations." we sort of found each other...
why do you want to do that? why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
yah!
were there ever any suspects?
kip took a job. fifty ladies in two weeks. only the two weeks have turned into four days. and not a single lady has been snared.
well i guess i don't have to go right now.  i guess i could stay a little while.
how 'bout this?
are you finished?
maybe you're right.
look, the man may be a fellow vulcan, but that doesn't...
there is nothing to discuss-
that you've been to susan?
al, as far as you're concerned, i'm the don.
morning!
you're still here?
what i mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, i know a place where you can go.
i've moved into scotty's... good news about t.j., though.  looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
it's not so bad these days. kids like joint custody. two sets of toys.
why should we leave? i love l.a. where we gonna go? what's the payoff?
everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. i am a traitor. when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal. leon, i should be stood up against the wall.
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
did you get help?
susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  but in her heart of hearts i imagine, dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. now, what about you, son?  not just tom-catting around...i hope?
yes, i loved you.  i left the earth when i lost you.
what do you see?
yes, dad.
behind a desk for a little while.  a desk!  they had him planning air raids.  a city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan.  there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  ask about spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade.  he was a famous sniper.  they called him "la picadura"--"the sting."
okay, let's go.
i'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
sure.  does your daughter want to come inside?
it was very dark.
of course he does. but he might get the wrong idea. anyone might.
and what's the price of their not finding out.
what's my rap?
fuck you.
he was right behind me !
they'll respect him now...
i've been looking for you.
but then, sir, why have you issued the order: wing attack, plan-r?
close the door.  sit down in that chair.  now listen carefully. your aunt em came here a couple of days ago. she was sick with worry, out of her mind. we had an interesting talk about you, thomas. do you understand what i'm saying? your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do i. tell me about it, kid. i want to hear all about it right now.
i'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  we can't risk it.
he didn't do it!
how.
i swear to god. in a very quiet voice.
it looks worse than it is. i'm okay.
i've got an idea.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in tsavo-
are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
look, it's too much of a tangle. i already cast my lot.  i can't go back and i can't sneak, feel back enough as it is.
oveur.
how come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
i'm sorry, guys. i thought it was a nice thing to do.
so, what's this about, dick?
i'll be back later.  you just be cool, okay.
what's this? december 8th, 1958?
do i look like i need your money.  it doesn’t work like that and i can’t tell you why.
so how'd he finally nail you? right there in the kitchen?
--don't think it could've gone any better. tell me, how's deb? how're my grandchildren?
well, why not!? that's exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance -- you have a better idea?
news?
shock trauma. she's going to need years of therapy after this. my question is, how did she come to have sex with the dead man?
cinderella man! babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. can you imagine cobb's face when he reads this?
everything okay?
i heard you were pumping gas -
didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
but i do work, so if you don't mind--
i'm fine. who is this?
um... juno, can i -- can i touch it?
it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  one last speedstar.
are you wigging out?
no.
what does he say?
tee, the beautiful babies don't work wednesdays midnight to six. this is the skank shift.
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room.
it was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. i must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. i can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. so it's in the left pulmonary artery.
no, salvatore. you'd better go. it's my father.
did you say cable junction?
my harrier.  join us, colonel.
you have to believe me, i had no idea --
you don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  how could i . . .
my son, my son...  your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  christopher, you must speak to them. and if you don't i will.
make love to me.
anna, what are you trying to say...
eh, you were miserable this morning! we got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
pretty good. me and annette bening are goin steady.
i'm not exactly having fun, either... steady.
the germans are advancing on kharkhov.
what i'd like to do---
hi, mr. maroon.  remember me?
i very seriously doubt it.  i don't think there is any possibility of making peace with england so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. that is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  with russia in the continental blockade, england must collapse.  more than 40% of her trade is with the continent and russia.
well, the whole town's curious about john doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. there's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
how's that?
well, i guess you got what you came for.
come with us.
there must be something...
that's not what i mean.  gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  i've got forty-eight hours.  i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
dead.
hey, you left your book back there.
nice.
like i said, it was like i was there. i remember everything.  the sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on shaina's face...
i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
god, you scared the shit out of me.  you must be crazy coming here.
but there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? is there?
miles massey.
mrs. hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. you'll love my grandma rosa.
what is there to say?  they know what john bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  come on, i'll show you thunder.
checked and locked, sir.
ah, cole.  i don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
she knows it's my case?
hey, boone.
it looks done.
... you mentioned the "bay of pigs" several times.  sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  they're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
what?...
and what do i get?
colwyn ...
fifteen and two thirds, actually.
smells like it.
another distraction.  it's not right.
well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  she's disappeared. maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
if things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
oh my god...
i meant no disrespect.
not here.  they might see it.
the doctor said you were having sex.
stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
they don't?
marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
you want a hand?
i got to get going.  an agent is showing me a house up on broad beach in ten minutes.
well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
who is they? is frank part of some larger group?
it's easy for you to be patient.
either side you idiot. i'm calling 911.
whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
your father was a sick weirdo.
yeah.
they're not supposed to be here!
whew, i'm sure glad that's over.
hey josie- who did archie date betty or veronica?
quite a place.
oh, elliot, please!  i can't be a party to this!  i'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
you got the wrong window again, man.
i'm rash and i'm stupid and what am i doing with you?
yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
so what's in paris?
no--i don't want to give any money. everybody wants money--i'm not going to give any money.
yes.
it's just such a slap in the face.
that's it?  is that it?
so does that mean that you sleep here every night?
i know he really likes you.
what?
alright, you got it. and i'll be putting an observer in with you.
yeah, then if i get jets, it's on to beeville, texas.
eli, john is a carpenter.  as well as being a fine policeman.
loretta...sidney falco...
uh-huh.
where is alsace?
every day.
now what is up with <i>that</i>?
huh?
so, i hear the tart from california shot heyworth.
where are you, anyway?
don't look at your feet, and i don't want to see anybody counting.  make it look easy.  again!
gal, you ain't right yet.
helen, i want you to be my wife.
so we heard it... like, right that... that first...
i want <i>you out of there.</i>
higher.  higher.
does it hurt?
was she that bad?
isn't that your speech?
what?
dare say you can be taught.
that's it.  pull over.  i'm drivin'.
mary had been there, one night, and had left.
my raincoat's in the back.  put it on.
but to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? it would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
you - wait! you didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
finish him, ned.
turn right on timonioum road. hurry, dad!
it's okay -- i'll sit here.
it's game time.
...he wasn't listening to the right thing...
craig, remember what i told you.
she must still be on the property.
useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. i told her, i'm sorry, but theses things happen. let's put it behind us.
yeah you are and you hate it.  you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  that you're sweating your balls off and i'm not. you've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
what are you doing?
are you sure, dear?
back so soon.
oh, no.
pittsburgh?
i do what i gotta do to survive.
they're questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport. some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
i saw it on tv.
chin, you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  if you have information, it belongs to us.
what are you doing here?
i can't talk just now.  i'm too tired.
so you're gonna call karen tomorrow?
there.
welcome to ya. what's your name?
oh, poor buster. he hasn't been fed in a day and a half. let me get some food...
i want a firm commitment.
and if you don't?
oh, be still my heart.
he has not been home since that day. but she told me where to find him.
moloko-plus.
you're in the stomach! let me try.
no. it's a lot further than that.
now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
it's fine.
but was it a bad decision?  at the time, i thought her money would save the movie.
what?
laura, do you love me?
no, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
i really don't know.
i wrote him on monday. they found him dead on tuesday.
that depends who writes the history books.  i'm not a quitter ... but i'm not stupid either ... a trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  but they won't get it.
and if we pull it, we lose a week... we only have two to the next full moon.
are you finished here, sebastian?
c-4?
they must've taken it off me.
the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! fifty lashes each!
on a plane back to sicily.
are you a close friend of haven's?
she can't hurt you any more.
it never worked before because a, they didn't flush the bank enough; b, their corporate papers were for shit; c, they didn't have someone on the inside with customs.
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation.
are you familiar with magnets?
mom, sit down for a minute. this is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
oh, sure... twice a day.
what are you doing?
she's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  has he brought it back on course yet?
good.
well, that solves one problem.  we don't have to worry about who to pay first.
the monkey.
that's what she is!
have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
what are these?
shelly, do you think i'm pretty?
and...and...henry chapman's girl, was it thelma? no, i can see those cornflower eyes...i've lost your name, my sweetness.
you know anyone's who's taken it?
m'hm.
is that all it's been? i thought it was longer.
that's right.
they're ready.  believe me, the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything.  of course, we get nothing from congress.  they need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
nothing.
i'm sorry...
well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. long-term parking charges by the day.
maybe. but in business class there are fine wines, linens, belgian chocolates.
tell that one, hollis--
yes.
we're on to the game, ese. you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... it's all very cute. but come on, let's quit while you're ahead. i'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
excuse... excuse me, when do i go on?
i want to watch t.v.
eight-thirty.
johnny!  uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  hey, where the hell were you all day?  you gotta at least call in or something.  you okay?
no nothing.
"the show must go on."
this isn't everything. get ready for this... there's a museum of murder and mayhem.
but there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness i couldn't learn to understand.
what is going on here, satch?  what are those guys doing out there?
now twenty seconds downrange...perfect tommy, how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
by the way, i'm a real manchurian.
oh, you mean fred.
we're on course, major.  just fixed our position on that river back there.
they give you copies to burn.
what are you talking about... ?
yes. he said... "do not try to make them understand you."
oh, it's a fire hydrant.
wait a minute.
i like enthusiasm.  that's why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
i know steve.  no.
i don't know about anyone else, but i could use a refresher in latin.  eight o'clock in my room?
they are... friends of congress.
how your mind hops about! your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and i will recover my fortune. that is the only matter under discussion today. you will like virginia.
no.  i'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
i know...
excuse me, mr. coccotti.  do you know nick cardella?
they tell me you're an american agent.
but see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
i've never heard about you.
4800 feet.  it's official.
well, i -- jerry, the point.  get there.  what does it have to do with the president?
no.  what am i to do?
i don't know.
the... the funny man.
really?
joanna, go fuck yourself!
i didn't do it. i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
'lo, cecil.
yes.
you didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? the stuff i left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
good to see you, bill. how's everybody doin'?
stop it, jez. don't do that.
that's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. fatten them.
hundred and sixty first street? that's yankee stadium.
i will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
hey...
just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
hey josie. it's josie, right?
she has the best palate of any woman i've ever known. she could even differentiate italian wines.
i'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
he'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. so stay out of his way.
you didn't miss much.  christ, what a mess.
you draw very well.
she's my mom.
pick it up!
holy shit.
i don't care. i need my hat.  i won't go without it.
virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. how did you know?
you just have to control it. we're not apes.
i'll send you some comic books.
a shelter?!  i’m the richest guy in the building...i’ve got twice the square footage you have!
johnny ola... hyman roth.
what is it? has he fainted?
a delivery device for nicotine. put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
you would, would you? listen, stupe -- the first week i was in this joint somebody stole my red cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. well, i wised up since. this ain't no salvation army -- this is everybody for himself. dog eat dog.
yeah.
feel anything?
did you talk to exley?
thank god -- thank god i've got you.
your mother, and your father
i think you need some help.
you won't need much. just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. adrenochrome.
okay. let's catch up. you go first.
bobo, no, i --
what the hell was that for?
plissken...?
where is that?
i'm paying people just to wait for you. it's ridiculous!
what the hell? why not? where should we go?
i'm having a party tomorrow.
what-what? where you been the last four five years? outer space?
how's it going?
we're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. count it out the back. i don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
that!  you can't wear that!
kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  you're a rational person. you're a trained psychiatrist.  you know the difference between what's real and what's not.
<u>i didn't dump you</u>!  get it through your skull -- i just recast the part!
okay, let's just slow down.  pull up the starfield signal origin.
they do, my brother.
when did you find this out?
well, bygones're bygones, i always say.
well, miss... i would say... i would say, yes. yes, he's crazy.
tell me, damn you!
i don't understand...
sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  if i hadn't defended myself- -
could you ever conceive of going to italy, tom, persuade my son to come home?  i'd pay you. i'd pay you 1000 dollars.
fuck man. come on, bobby.
you... i've seen you around the base. but you...  you're not army, are you?
here’s the thing.  i really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  you know, anniversary’s good all day...
...on the way in.
made me sick, but what did i care? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  it was just something i was doing for money.
do you want to rest a bit?
it would be fantastic.
yes.
i'm fine. i'm fine, i just wanna keep playing --
i think i will get back in messina this summer... it's too long i haven't been there.
so all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
i never forget, honey.  i try, real hard. it's just, for some reason, i don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, i end up falling short.
all right? that's wonderful! it's the majestic -- 44th street.
we're expecting brown this afternoon, ma'am.
just try it.
he went to pick up lunch.
yes, master!
it's an amazing place, don't you think?
this is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
[i don't know! we work in parts. a voice calls in a kidnapping. we deliver the target to the guardians. we don't even know them. they might transfer to other guardians. the negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. they just make the deal!]
hey! you shouldn't be down there!
hello?
let him find out on his own.  i want the hong kong police handling this.
but he is gone.
what did she say?
oh.  well, i hate you and everyone who looks like you.
is he breathing?
if the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
willow.  to learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
whoa... she just farted.
what are you hiding, danny?
sir.  yes.  when a thing is wrong...as in this case, i am available.  i am seventy-four years old, i am not board-certified.  i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done.
me neither.  how far is rancho cucamonga?
it's the only way you're gonna get ganz.
jessica, can you drive me home?
what do you want to drink?
we have only bits and pieces of information.  what we know for certain is that, at some point in the early twenty-first century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to a.i.
i don't know. there's just things i still want to do.
bullshit.  where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
she shore don't look prosperous. want to go somewheres else?
sixty pounds.
let's just say i...eh...i'm involved.
i wasn't watching television.
surely you know what you have.
no.
he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
they're smart.  been to college. they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
... and what do you call these?
well, i'm in new york now.  what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
when he was seventeen.
where are they!
thelma!
where's the baby?!
he's a boy dog.
oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
what about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
oh, it's all right. it's organic.
i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you.
yeah? allison what?
sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... i'm sorry...
peter valerian.
do you remember him?
i didn't say.
i'm glad you came.
i've come to strike a bargain with you.  i wish to learn the power of changing.
some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
okay.  good afternoon.  goodbye.
you're not leaving tomorrow..?
right back at the start, right?
i'll sue you.
what the hell's a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister's?
beth?
if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? the thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. if it doesn't, then it's no good.  i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
child...!?
pardon me--*this* is. where are we now?
just a moment.  starling didn't...
why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
you don't have to sound so emphatic.
please.
fourteen.
it's fine.
we're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit, now do your part
do you have any idea what's involved? the paperwork alone?  forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  then the engineers show up.  they stand around and they argue about drainage - i'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, i've been through it, i know.
come with me. and stay in the room.
- it's important right now that we talk. killer to killer.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. may i have a drink of water? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
the key?
how often do you go?
is that so?
oh, that's fun.
georgia.
you told ann about this?
my cousin will be here tomorrow.
no you don't.
what?
ground rules! where the fuck do you think you are, wimbledon?
hi, sweetface. you look great. and mmmmm, you smell good, too.
i think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
it's called a cascading bio- genic pulse. the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
i haven't seen much of you.
i'm your son.  i'm you.
you think i'm shitting you...
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
how do you do?
no violence, please.
you just relax. nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
you're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington. d.c.
quarter after one. why?
just an accident. nothing.
two lousy smokes.  you're a real sport.
it's short, huh?
i think you're crazy. don't look over, it's lenny silverman.
yeah?
claudia, listen to me...
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that'd make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
are you angry at me?
well?
it's only a b-b-b-book...
pardon?
the guests are here.
i'm sorry... i didn't mean to shout...
who's the shawnee land and cattle comp'ny?
well, martin, i only wear them in washington -- that's the trouble. but if you ever come down there, i'll show them to you.
ro - you can't really believe that. nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  i mean --- that's crazy.
i got to get downstairs.  the c.i.a., they want to see your body.
yes.
now about the falkner sisters. that's kind of funny. i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here. do you mind if i talk to them?
your friend lives in a fine building.
i'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. it would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... can we check back on that?
some<u>one</u>?  gimme a hint.
you're to be discharged tomorrow. will you be all right?
... if i may quote the twentieth century poet  - joe piscahpo:  you look marvelous...
what do you mean -- wuss? this girl is my exact type. it's her. definitely her.
with two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as i can. then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
it is kind of you to make this effort.
yes, it is a calamity for us all.
what do you want to know?  what difference does it make?  i'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  i make you feel good. you make me feel good.  what the hell else do you want from a guy?
you couldn't win an egg and spoon race, eric.
i'll make it part of the class. we'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
brill.
think about what i said.  i mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  same old reed, the hopeless optimist. still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
rita. rita.
need what? civilised order like we have down here? christ!
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes. it's like a public service.  it doesn't mean much in the end. they're all going to die.
did you sleep with her?
the pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. huey wants us to stop them.
fair katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
and what else?
tell me.
i'll get the girl.
vivian.  i'm paying you to be you.  be you.  have you?  ever been in love with anyone?
look at me! i'm your baby!  get a load of that blonde one! built like a brick kremlin!
name something.
let us see. we have now two empty bunks here.  nummer einundsiebzig und nummer dreiundsiebzig in baracke vier.
see you later.
but i guess my best just isn't good enough.
this is a terrific entrance hall, what a welcoming feeling.
it's called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.
fine.
i've served with men like you before. methodical.  systematic -- naive.  you know what happens to those men in a real fight?
actually.  i could only help him.
she's dead.
and what if he really is a spy?
'morning.
bensinger -- of the tribune.
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires...
bloody.
life?! what's life mean? there's no way i can do life. i got a job starts monday morning!
conscious? cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
yeah!
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the tv - but i'm not you know - they are - i don't watch it for entertainment every night - i don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? she was dead - i can't hurt something dead - and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - i couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
oh, it's you, gray. well, come in. sit down. have a glass with me.
your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
in that half will be bait- human bait- i'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
please hurry.
want to tell me what happened?
helen-thomas-webber!  maybe we have been down here a little too long!  please excuse her french.
no. let's forget everything!  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
but you never do.
get dr. corey.
yeah, i'll do that, dave.
it'll be heaven!
yeah, yeah. say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
okay. all right, so whatta yuh saying, now? that e-e-everybody o-o-on the warren commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  what gives you the right to judge me, to play god with the lives of others?  is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
look i gotta get going, shouldn't you have met katka?
and what is the magic word, mr. venkman?
no, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
he's white and six feet tall. you haven't told me anything yet.
this is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
no -- don't out me off.
it used to make me laugh .but.
i can see what you looked like as a kid.
just a bat! i'm fine! just a bat! sorry!
what's the matter with miss kubelik?
and what was that?
i work for harry zimm, alright?
who?
i mean, i'm having a good time with you...
business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
huh?
i'm serious. get this. i had a careful look at that alternator. it's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
mr. welles certainly is a caution
-- his left jacket pocket.
he's going to have you the rest of his life, hildy. can't you give me another hour?
it's not going to be very comfortable.
it's never big enough.
give me another double brandy.
i embroidered.
...i stank, didn't i?
how long's it been?
i can put you in the ring with him. even book the dates.  but those big boys know how to fight. they could make you look real sissy.  i was looking at that painting upstairs. it's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  so what's your real name? 'samo?'
what are my choices?
you'll find enough cong up there.
jeez, i don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
who?
okay, let's see... you can have him on tuesday the 25th...
i'm fine. i've just never had someone my age die before. it's so weird.
yeah, that'd be a big shame...
yes?
well, if something was stolen, i should know about it.
that's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
where did you get this?
no, it was not.  do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews?
to protect. to serve you. chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now.
do you live here?
we're your guys.
i said, ask your wife.
what are you doing on the wall?
come on, get moving, dammit!!
anything else you --
which is everyone you couldn't get in.
i don't. my hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. i was able to do her a small favor.
oh, i would hope not.
yeah.
you can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. i'm only killing time.
who?
come on, relax. he's drunk.  he's been locked up for six years.
elaine, what happened to us?
well, i just want to know the procedure. i don't want to upset your routine. do you want any jam?
you're great.
i don't know why i'm so tired all of a sudden.
if you believe it, darling, then i believe. being young can be just as confusing as being old. the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
no. i was the first picard to leave earth.  it caused quite a stir, in fact. but i had spent my whole life...
say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
i told you to stay away from tramell.
chaplin's modern times! right, toto?
oh, my! 
i have something i have to show you...
we agreed that if i took care of the business; i'd be entitled to the extra. isn't that what we agreed?
he hasn't called?
christ. how many tunnels lead off the island?
well, no system is.
you told a lie and got on a plane.
yeah. sure. once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
i ain't sure...where's that doll?
oh, you! i'm not talking about her hands. they're difficult to ignore, i confess, but i'm speaking of her whole being. her whole being is extraordinary. the way she talks, for example. she's so articulate.
she hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - i won't have it! eve harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
if i asked you to, would you? not on tape, i mean?
what?  how could he have?  when?
why else would she have flown in from newport? it's not like she'd fed ex a six carat diamond.
you've been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?
i don't get it. what do you do?
what are you -- stupid?
do you?  then why don't you go out? meet someone.  make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
i think you're right.
actually, my first script was about hannah and her husband, but, uh...
this night is too beautiful to have again.
goodnight.  see you home.
eve, this is an old friend of mr. dewitt's mother - miss caswell, miss harrington...  addison, i've been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time-
and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. the the whole plane... blew up. it was so real. exactly how everything goes.
c'mon, tom, pick up a job.
it's getting kind of chilly on deck. if you'll excuse me, i think i'll go to bed. good night, mr. mckinney!
here.
why, you need me for the story?
all you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, i'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
spunky. he told you about that?
alternate lz zulu sierra at 0500. it says "may have heat.  don't be late.  all our love."
someone like me, like you.  a pro.
i presume it's a sword.
how did you know i was here?
how can you say that?
the president is about to speak. i don't think it's going to be good news.
you think you're so funny.  you're not even funny.  right?  right?  you don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
when?
who was that?
transference!
fine frank. fine. how are you?
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
matthew, look at him. when i lived in roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. he was bigger than ten movie stars.  where's your white lincoln limo?
oh, it sure has... you know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
mom and dad won't be back until sunday night. it's halloween carnival. we should throw a party. we could totally get away with it.
it's your fantasy...
so, we're talking money laundering...
almost three.
what?
the other two will die without me.
a porsche.
what's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
i left a man dead in felton.  but you don't really care, do you?
hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
yeah. give ya a boner.
one of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
secret service!
well, how about we wait and see what harry comes up with?
you ready?
you can't help them.  right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
these read as identical composition...  ... however, captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
it's about destiny, picard. about a reman outcast who...
have you seen any redcoats?
your use of language has altered since our arrival. it is currently laced with -- shall i say -- more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
aye.  we be on a quest to set the world aright --
he doesn't get it. held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. it's too dangerous for him.
you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
you still there?
how old are you?
well, you said anybody can waltz... how'm *i* doin'?
how come you don't stay with them?
i don't give a fuck about your parents --
i'm afraid i've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
no.
if you give him the chance, lansky will betray you like judas.
okay--i mean--
you planned this whole thing, didn't you?
it was tammy i  that's who it was.
she met him at dinner last night... i like this tie.
no, richard, no. what has happened to you? last night we said --
what? what?
how do you hold down a job?  it's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she's missed her sunrise groom'n ride.
everest.  is that right?
hello.
where are they?
good christ!  can't you lose these jokers?
can't sleep?
well, see, i was talking to mr. mcallister about my leg and everything... and how i still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
what did you get me?
it's impossible.  i was buying or selling something.  i've been to cairo many times.
you won't get away with this!
we'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
it's probably picking up another baby monitor.
that was very good.
who by?
walter byrd killed kay connell.  her things are in the house.
did you come home during the day last week?
you don't have to do anything!
you nitwit! i worked for three years on this deal!
mrs. semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
so i can get my job back.
you sure you want to know this?
thank you.
ah!  and what sort of man is this worshiper?
two of 'em?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. i don't know all the details.
i felt guilty. 'cause i "owed so much" to alice. but even then i was starting to wonder. is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? if you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. you grow older but you don't grow up. you turn into -- into --
oh, yeah...
take the western passage.
it concerns only jah.  but, in this case, i was the instrument of the most high.
i'm in detroit.
eat up, book. what's the matter with your appetite?
the containment, second containment...
thanks anyway.
because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at christmas?
radar stealth mode checks out.  all right, there'll be less security north of the george washington bridge.  i'm taking her down.
the fog, terror train, prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies?
of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. it's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as d&d mattress man.
not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
and that's what concerns me. elizabeth, we will be landing in port royal soon, and beginning our new lives. wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
you know the ten commandments?
not your style.  is it eddie?  killing off your customers?
i thought you were with amy.
-okay okay.
helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. what are we going to do about it?
that was quick.
oh, couldn't you say something? you have to slither around behind my back!
i promise.  dead poets honor.  come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, i swear i'll bow out.
nice guy.  who's he?
i just wanted to call before you left.  i'm takin' all these job interviews. so i won't just be a construction worker.
oh -- i'll take the same, i guess. and coffee.
hey, sam...
we're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
howdy, mr. stone. we've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the grange?
where to, madame?
so what do we do with the device?
i'm going to give her a wedding present.  thought i'd better do it now, before i forget it.  i can drop them on my way to...  that's funny....  where are those bonds?
oh, brother, i am so disappointed in you. you mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
ha. did he say why?
really?  hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
mrph?
mikey loves his birthday present.
master crane, sir.  i'm glad we have time alone.  you've been told plenty about the horseman, i'm certain.
what?
what's happening with my call to sac?
whaddya got, whaddya got?
i have.  spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i weren't such a coward, i'd kill myself.
all the time?
mmm, what?
lando, grab it!
why not, larry? we could get a positive confirmation that way.
i clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
none.
what are you doing?
--a <u>lot</u>.
yeah, well my stereo player is broke. but i'm sure the record is ok.
sorry about last night.
you guys wanna play some more poker?
samhain.
what is it with you and the space program?
ooooh!
they told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  everybody  dies!
then i don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
oh, i ain't doing that any more. i'm retired. i'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
...i got a present for you.
am i at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
with that set of lungs -- she should be.
don't worry about that.  guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
what do you think?
we get to the bridge, we're all right!
oh come, neighbor stone. i wouldn't cut that tree if i were you. it means a breach of contract.
what happened?
we want you to help run it. give speeches, lead seminars... handle the fund-raising.
just do it, okay?
mr. gordon, did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs. lippman?
harold!
you come and visit.
hey, tim, you know what? you win.
good luck. i love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
not yet.  we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
then what's the problem?
adlai's too weak! we have to convince jack to pull him, get mccloy in there.
tomorrow, i start looking for our house... you love me?
i think we should be going honey.
i did?
what's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
what? please? now? tell me?!
ryan's really angry with me.
why, certainly -- but be careful, mr. scratch -- medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
how nerdy is that? i'm wearing two pairs right now.
rose, what are you doing up?
you will or you'll be back at bet so quick you'll never know what hit you.  i need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  it will be on the fast track.
feeling better, oz?
security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  it's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
lizzy... you gotta understand something. i've bet it all to find the heart of the ocean. i've got all my dough tied up in this thing. my wife even divorced me over this hunt. i need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  you see this? right here?
i know, you'll find me.  jesus, i believe it.  i keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who i am.
let me see the plant press.
never heard of him.
hold me --
no, i read it on the message.
neither do you.
did he get fresh?
so they're trying to kill you and your baby. don't tell me.  your name also happens to be rosemary.
i asked you a question.
we're leaving in three hours.
doc...
aye, ma'am.
i'm really tired.
jesus christ, get a grip, louis.
yes.
how much ya wanna bet?
...excuse me.
you are crazy!
keep 'em coming.
well, i think jack needs some time alone with you, darling... he's getting to that age, you know... he really misses you...
rick, i'm sick and tired of having you --
something on your mind?
all right. you can come.
only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for mrs. mulwray?
oh -- oh, miss flaemmchen. it's you --
i'll see what i can do.  you know, lainey.  i don't believe you've ever once asked to meet simone.  don't you like her?
i can't name anybody she does like these days.
come now, athos, if porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
one chance here, eduardo.  make us believe you got a boss.  no boss, it's all on you.
do you know a marie?
but you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. why isn't it stupid?
isn't it interesting though?  i mean, look at us, in this room.  or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  i mean, we look like just another couple.  but what are we?  doesn't it seem so crazy?
lose the hardware now.
well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. he left everything to us. he traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. you should do the same thing, mr. deeds.
you and dunbar got your stories straight. little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you. you think you're just going to slide out of this? you're an accessory to murder, levi, you're going to jail --
you didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
i know you do. i love you too, annie.  and you're right. we are meant to be together. and i know we must die. but it must be so that misery can live. we have the power to give misery eternal life. we must finish the book.
oh, so you're in the big shit now!  child abuse.  people go to prison for what you just did to me.
yes.
hey, do you know something? she supports a mother and two kids. what do you know about that?
that's what this is all about?  a shakedown?  you picked the wrong people.  we don't have any money.
it wasn't so important to me. i mean, he never asked me why i was a hooker, and that was impressive. i really liked him. so i decided to just play my part. i mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. i suddenly came to a decision.
my pleasure .. who's popeye?
these are my children. mine. and they ain't no question. none.
... thank you.
josh proposed!
yes.
kenai's pa -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
you see, particularly with the marge problem, you can just blame me.
you never know.  go get some sleep.
it's a big and busy funeral home.
yes.
it's not like her.
crash victim?
what the hell happened to you?
that it's about to go wrong.
sure.
yeah. could look bad for you and kaminski too, i guess.
dylan?  he's holding well.  earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
you're not goin' through this again? you? you're not the one who knows how jiffy pop feels.
i need your help.
now many?
hi honey.  what's going on?					*
it turned out phil green, mr integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the tangiers...
it's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
of what?
no, but her words are in my head.  i know what you think, that it's a trick, that i'm making it up. no, the words i heard, were her words.
we don't have a maid any more.
yes, they are. you're out of shape.
hey, mike?
wait a second. he knows i know.
you're a careful kid, and that's good.  but look.  an international dispatch on the wire service. american journalism, not propaganda. the government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  all but their radio station.
who's writing this dude's dialogue?
i have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. this house needs just <u>everything</u>. i'll probably be gone all day. jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
t'aggia parla. [italian-american slang for 'i've got to talk to you'] nicky... see that guy? 
well, it's not unusual in his case... sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. the brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. a person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. are you relatives?  well, it doesn't matter. we'll take care of it. he'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
raoul is everything to me.
can i hold him?
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless..
brad, you are drunk.
don't call me doll, larry.  i hate it when you call me doll.
jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? that he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
oh, yeah?
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
george?  what do you know about cocaine?
we go for a walk.
i don't know... i don't remember.
no, toxoplasmosis. sort of like a stroke.
they're gonna kill her, walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
it's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. and turn your head. there might be some debris flying your way.
where'd he go?  i'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
michael? what ha...
not even then. the police are the proper people to conduct this affair. now if you've got any suspicions i'll drive you to the nearest police station.
going somewhere?
deanna, on my mark.
hello, leon!
doesn't sounds like him.
let me talk to her again.
i've tried it.
you know i do know the way home.
money?  if that's what it signifies to you. security?  comfort?  all it is is things that happen to you.  that's all it is.  how are they different?  some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  some busboy wins the lottery.  all it is, it's a carnival.  what's special...what draws us?  we're all different.  we're not the same.  we are not the same.  hmmm.  it's been a long day.  what are you drinking?
oh, westley, darling.  westley, why won't you hold me?
oh, yes! do that! you treat me right, man. tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
don't speak, quellek.
that bad?
this is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
the reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description, and i'm supposed to follow it, right?
but you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
are you sure about this?
no.
you wanted to meet here?
do you really know everybody in the industry?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
where'd she been?
that crazy sumbitch made it.
people, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
buddy, i am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  i just feel awful. do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while?
hey, stop, stop. i'll do anything you want. it's okay. i can dig it. you can do anything you want to me.
lucy overdosed.
what a bunch of losers.  mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
can i have your autograph?
there are agency regulations about this.
i'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
dance!
of them.
if you don't want my film - i'll call another show.  and they will show it.
she wasn't certain... i never really showed her.
very well, mr. scott. carry on.
this is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  here's one at 9:04 pm.  it says:  from debi.  please call me at home.
then answer this: if ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
the nite owl!  stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
two.  and i'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with al junior.
its called insubordination.
molly?
his mother was killed before his eyes. that's what drove him insane. it'll work.
lucky for us, the da vinci is located in a wing of the kremlin that they used to throw the miss ukraine pageant and stuff.  it'll have the least number of guards....
keep that up, mister, and i'll find you in contempt.
no volunteers, price. i said we're all in on it.
it's okay. it's okay.
so, do you like me, seymour?
but . . ..that's terrible!
that black car?
there's no transportation anyway this time of night.
i didn't know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
from the guys who got the matches, of course. 
look, man. i don't care if you're putting from the rough. there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; alexander the great, caeser, shakespeare, oscar wilde, napoleon, gertrude stein, not to mention danny terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
weren't you going to get some glasses?
okay, fine, you're full a shit, i'm full a shit.
yes
just what you've published.
alright, cindy, what's so important?
i mean it. i don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
what's ailing that dog?
murphy to epps.
was i wrong to cast loretta?
yah, but -
i'm a bowler.
mr. brown?
i don't deserve that. i have never looked at you as a disappointment. if i'm on your back to do better, if i push you to try harder it's because i want you to be the best you can be.
well, that's what i knew then.  or who i knew, i should say.  you see, i was trying to court miss angstrom.  i went to the meeting to impress her.
oh clark, no!
imagine how i feel.
and something to sharpen them with?
did you miss me?
seriously?
i can't believe he remembered you. he never remembers anybody.  you know i tried to call you for weeks after that.
where the hell were you?!!
a grave...
everybody's talkin' about ya, charlie. first time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
maybe he'll get tubed.
honey, some of this is... farfetched. you take after me. people skills and common sense. good dependable qualities.
why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
now, fran --
hey, quaid!
you know, when i first saw you, i thought you were an american.
i don't ever see any of you precops down here, i'm not in trouble am i?
let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. he's quite intelligent...
those are suzie toller's teeth.
who cares?
you're also an idiot.
millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma.
well?
you wrote it, didn't you?
yeah.
she is.
i won't.
that's too bad. i got a half million shares. my whole foundation! and now look at me!
by the time i'm at the belt, you phone and say, "how are you?"  forty-five minutes later i reply, "not bad.  how are you?"
when it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him.  i'll give him an earful!
i'm not in trouble.
naturally i think so.
you only made half your quote this year.
yes. they want to help.
your --
quick.
i just glances inside.
janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
and what?
he's going to be a fireman.
--there's that word again.  i have a feeling this man doesn't play the odds, detective.  not exactly a slave to probability.  is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
yeah, great. the problem is, i have four days to come up with something, and i don't have a single idea.  you know anything about christmas stories?
no.  it's unhealthy.
guess.
crime?
not even close. hell, we can't even make syria or iraq.
i think it's time discuss your career path. have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
professor brown! it's almost eight thirty -- i'm outta here!
kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. now if you'll excuse me, i have some work to do.
mr. chekov, anything unusual?
nothing happened, johnny.
i think that was farther west in the sierras.
i'm sorry. where were we?
i'm not mad at you.
run into josh?
that was really sweet...
listen, you fuckin' yokel, i've had it with you. i've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since i got here. get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
you wanted to see me, mr. m.?
i don't have to answer your questions.
mine's edward. and truthfully, i do want you to leave, karl. but i want to leave with you.  you think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. i can't see staying here a day longer.
what?
indy?
hi, sweetie.  were you a good girl?  where are matt and katie?
is this the place?
what are you going to do?
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
peter sends his regards.
shoot him.
denial is not a river in egypt.
well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
totally.  i checked all the rooms and closets...
whose boat is that?
then v'ger believes the creator to be a <u>machine</u> too.
i'll be there, too!
dad, i gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  cause i still remember.
i'll be watching over you.
your medicine, mister mcmurphy.
good morning, mr. merrick.
yeah?
you say that like a gentleman.
i have to talk to you.
i got you cold, pal.  make it easy for yourself, use your head.
i'm just quiet.
i think you're just yellow.
but you have problems?
shall i tell them again?
who's that?
i mean…your majesty, they do not, they have not, but i believe there is one who can
no, i... i held it up to...
no.
look, i bagged it last week.
in high school.
what about the girl?
marcia, you know i started "misery" on a lark. do i look like a guy who writes romance novels? do i sound like danielle steel? it was a one- time shot and we got lucky. i never meant it to become my life. and if i hadn't gotten rid of her now, i'd have ended up writing her forever.  for the first time in fifteen years, i think i'm really onto something here.
hello. my name is lydia sinclair.
that's what you were saying.  i heard what you were saying.
like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
my daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
what?
this jimmy's?
why come to me?
to win.
is this the chiefs' recommendation?
yeah.
i thought we were on our way.
i thought you took care of this. it always breaks in the same place. it's your splice, isn't it?
you can't imagine how many men have told me that.
one weekend i went to a combat ranch...  you know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  must sound pretty silly to you...
but the poor kid's going crazy. she'd rather know her father was dead than that...
it clearly states in the will --
she does have one thing you don't.
say goodnight to sam for me.
calvin, i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. it's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
that was about as grim as it gets.
is that a request or a command?
what is this insolence?
that thought doesn't terrify you?
someone stole my stuff.
you know what i think?
you can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
i'm bobby clowes. kansas city.
am i seeing right? creed is approaching the ring in a boat. is he supposed to be george washington? obviously so.
i'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. there we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
i ain't sure.
rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. we are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
jesus christ!! you crazy people...
where?
well - no - i think i'd better wait. yes, yes. i will. i'll wait.
may i say something, mr. president?
i'm curious about you.
...janitor's job.
all right. i'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
good.
austin, i'm coming with you.
huh?  oh, him, yeah.  well i don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
i put a gun right here...  ...and i tell him, 'sign the paper marty or your fuckin' dead.' like that.
...i'll give you a ring from venice.
you mean beethoven's 9th symphony?
yes.
she's got other problems, of course...
forty-five minutes.
i think it would be helpful if i gave you some background on the different personalities regan has manifested. so far, there seems to be three. she's convinced-
what are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
indeterminate life signs.
you can't figure me out. you're the strange one..
sorry. i'm still getting the hang of this.
it's on the way.  i see you went ahead and cut your hair.
merrin!!!!!!!
the old man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  he has one just like it.
you sure as hell haven't been any help.
i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  not only physical, but also psychological.
that's not the way we play the game.
she doesn't want pity.
no.  jody, listen to me.  you have to listen to me.  this is not something that i can do right now.  whatever it was, it's gone.  i need it to be gone now.
with what?
your mother was a saint.
he's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  we heard from doctor hudson?
i'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
can't we at least talk about it?
...for christmas, okay?  every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
no.  follow him.
i think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
well, uh, i'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe i could call you tonight.
sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
but for you, what comes first: music or love?
they're not following me, dan.  i mean -- jon's gone, we're right on the brink of world war iii.  nobody cares about the watchmen.
just listen.  you remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan--
have you ever had a dream, neo, that you were so sure was real?
what are you looking at him for?  any objections, sefton?
there you are, sir.
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
sam, listen -- i shot to defend my man.  other guy drew first.
ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. this love line here...  ...that's from some crazy frenchie come after me with a knife. i caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
hello.
st. katherine's is a benedictine order. you have taken a vow of hospitality.  to all in need.
swell! passing ten thousand!
are my seams straight?
i mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? i don't get it. don't they get confused? "is that mine? i thought it was yours." hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
you're lucky, chucky, you... ow!
not yet.
that's very kind of you.
oh, a new recruit, huh? welcome to hell, kid! relax! take a load off!!
i'm glad i didn't have to kill you.  i'm glad it didn't come to that.
to go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  i've already made my move.
so how long to pop the floor?
doctor v. l. pemberton.  i knew it.  he's a scientist all right. inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine.  i'm telling you, artemus, loveless is our man.
it would have been a beautiful bridge, john. i never noticed before, occupied with other business, i	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but i've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
i wish i knew.  it's for my boss.  he's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  would that be okay?
i can't believe we're stealing a plane.
i am.
you sure?
come on.  i want you to see something.
ow!  no, it's okay.  it's better tight.
did you hear that?  my god.  he says that mbwun is real!
now don't be nervous.
well...
because of your father. the way what his sins shaped you.
it's not your career -- it's mine. i kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  i don't want to be a reader all my life.  i want to write.
i'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
leave me alone.
five hundred rabbits?
you go?  not watch fun?
his hatred of the federation is apparent. he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. he is going after earth.
that's it.
i don't like it.  something's wrong.
i can't say i know patrick all that well.
i don't know anything about zavitz.
that ulf report everybody's patting me on the back about?
can i cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? he's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  well yes, he could be playing with himself. mmm hmm. yes i'll ask. dade, you like girls, don't you?
that's franny. she likes firemen.
i was here six years.  and i only hated two.
can you marylin? can you return the trust? can you return the hopes? the dreams? can you just...  send it all back for store credit?
it's only ninety seconds up the line. you're on a connection to a trans siberian express.
dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  even i don't understand it sometimes.  now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
every other damn thing in the country is called after martin luther king, they can't let our side have one measly park?
oh, yuck! oh, gross!
why didn't they say that before you started?
you please me, court composer. a very clever idea.
really?
so where is it?
the key!
he's waiting. he's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
a distinct possibility.
yes.
i'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. any suggestions?
you're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, jules.
want to come out?
your lunch? you have a luncheon appointment here?
... the power?
i'll go pay for my car.
what about your job?
need some gas?
not by a long shot.
come into the kitchen.  i'm just making your mother's tea.
well, did you get a job out of it at least?
and...
what did i say?
<u>nasa</u> is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake.
you shouldn't have come.
what's the matter?
i don't think it was really decided, director.
and what do you know? you tell me my life? i'll tell you yours. i'm a wolf? you run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! you're gonna marry my brother? why you wanna sell your life short? playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. you waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
n-n-n-n-no, no, i du-du-du-didn't, i didn't!
it wouldn't work.
you're barking up the wrong tree, hartman.
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin'. how far did you want to go?
i was just wondering... nick... you're going hunting... if i could use this place to stay, because...
well, i'm going to change real quick. i hope you don't mind.
he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
well, what have i got?  alimony to a pair of tramps?  they're of no concern to me.  it's you who count, but don't get me wrong - i don't intend to let you break your neck again!
i'll ask you one last time. do you have diss digg?
oh, shit.
ted, i can't...i tried...i really tried but...i just can't hack it anymore...
me, domesticated?  by you?  i doubt it!  you repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
pretty much.
am i being interrogated?  you should be trying to trick me.  ask me about tottenham hotspur.  or buckingham palace. about marmite - i was addicted.  or make me speak german, which i can, by the way.
you're miz cooper, i take it.
housecleaning?  it would be ugly, henry, really ugly ...
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare.
it is trouble for me.
any idea what he did?
where's the girl? miss stone.
what you doin'?
we understand.
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
just in case someone gets a shot off.
i redecorated.  what about you?
yes, that would certainly do...
are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
diane, how are you feeling?
raoul, no... you cannot do this.  no matter how your heart is broken --
well, dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity?
listen, i don't have any plans-- you want some help?
she wanted something to help her sleep.
what’s he do anyway?
diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  people change.
i'd like to hear them.
it's bullshit.  the report's a joke.
pregnant, is she?
here's another wire from peter warne.
no i'm serious. can i suck your tit? either of you guys. i don't care.
i don't know what the hell to say....
what?
_answer_ me.
it's...him.
why, mary --
why didn't anybody tell me?!
mr. barton, do you remember me?
listen to me good, evan...
i'm going to be at the dance.
that shelter was in this bill.
that's right?
no, it just struck me as odd...i don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
i'm sorry.  i can't.  i....
fireworks.  update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the state college at new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a viking funeral with none of the morbidity... the hudson river authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the poughkeepsie fire dept...
just how grateful i am.
ok.
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself!
they don't say it to me.
proud?
sorry, that it a biocyte facility, their storage structure..
you've been reading for hours.
why... should you care?
and why was that?  did it have some particular value or power?
check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
the most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. that's a medical fact. and it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. you're actually thinking like a girl. they love that.
<u>don't say his name</u>!  just practice. do it <u>yourself</u>!
he has to clean up.  how many bodies were there?
excellent performance, my friend. the judge was very impressed.
what're you thinking, jerry?
shut up, tod!  be serious!
shut up!
--i got a trip to mars.
no. you like the way i do things.
i thought we were going to take it easy until the mission...
they won't until this is over.
any place.
what is it, norman?
better let me talk to him.
... it's not just from tonight.  i've known you for a long time.  i see you come out of work every day.  i walk with you to lunch.  i know what you order... i see you buy baby ruths before going back in...  i know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... i know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and i love you.   i love you.  i think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and i would be knocked out several times if i even got just a first kiss.  but i'll be back in the morning.  and i won't be distant.  and i will call if you let me... but i still don't drink coffee.
that's too bad.
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole. we're all so proud of you, jesse. and not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. you're everybody's hero.
well then.
just wait here?
my career is shot.
who is this?
don't look back, just get in the car.
vodka martini.
what you're saying is we have a great white shark in the lagoon.
that's not doubt.  that's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
perfect. i'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
take it easy, now. just go slow. down by that tree.
last night.
and what is it you do, ms. mitchell.
poor darling, and then?
i hear what you're saying, but i know what you're thinking.
explain it... i told you.
nine-thirty, ten maybe.
are you under the impression that now i'm in some way obligated to you?
i did. i brought you back here.
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
when are you boys going to fix that roof?
none of that's true?
you know, i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
the hell are you fiddling with there?
ceida pietraszkiewicz.
yep.
you sure? i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily. special blend. can't find anything like it in the states.
next time it'll be my neck.
you've made your point.
—running around. not your work.  you'd better start reforming, cyril!
yes.
what is wrong with me?
i work bank robbery.  guys i'm after are surfers.  i needed you, at first, but not--
no, not that. i'm talking about the associated press. they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i. did you tell them that we were lying?
when was that?
stupid.
at least your pms is over.
no.
later.
you're on the verge, mulder -- please don't do this to me --
i can't write.
what will aubrey think?
carter...here comes the rich white man.
oh yes.
i don't know what to say about it, walter.  it was a form of temporary insanity.  but i had to tell you about it because --
oh, no. i wouldn't go ...
oh, right.  yes.  harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  wouldn't hurt a fly.
that's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
you just ripped my card in two!
are you all right, now?
yeah, i'm sure.
none of the stewards have seen her.
it's cosmo's moon.
thanks, but i have my own now.
you'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
i'm not here very much.
forgive me, please. what a gracious thought. we must do that.
aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
but -
reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
yeah, right...
oh, my.
never saw <that>. not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
what's in the back?
by freeing them.
i feel good.
how do you do, mr. leland?
cross my heart.
complete your inspection?
bye, mom.
i wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  i'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew.  i'd find their little toys all over the place.
i think she's the alien.  in any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
will you shut-up!!!
ah, so that's it.  to you i'm just a girl.
no thanks, louis.  i'm really tired.  i've been rehearsing all morning.
i got what i paid for.
that's going to be fun.
you should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
"i didn't get lured and i will take responsibility for my actions".
she did. this photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
are we playing multiple choice?
yeah, i guess.
i wanted you to say, "no!  i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores."
max pelcher?  you're kidding?
what happened to gibarian?
i miss him.  you know, sometimes i wake up in the morning, and i think 'i have to make frank's breakfast,' and i... i get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, i remember.  i miss talking to him.  cathy's a child, you know, and mitch...  ...mitch has his own life.  i'm glad he stayed here today. i feel safer with him here. 
nah.
so, you seeing anybody?
i'm sorry... about what i said. it's just that -- all those times you and daddy were trying for another kid, i... i used to pray at night that it would work. and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister... but... just so i wouldn't have to be...
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  i've thought about it and there's no other way.  if you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well i can't let that happen.  i'm telling you i won't.  if there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then i'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
hey...
the machine was stopped!  it seemed like a perfect time to disable it! why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
yes, it's looks good.....we will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. the others will just be house lights.
may i ask what you're doing?
better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
less sensational papers go broke. i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
to an asian design major.
yes, sir.
you!  i remember you!
i didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
no, sir, none at all.
what kind of gun was it?
then you were talking to him.
what?
how 'bout that furniture plant?
where's the girl?
jabez ...
hello?
for murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
everybody wants something.
what the hell is that? dr. weir?
according to mother, sir august owns half of the highlands. a millionaire. former head of special projects at the ministry. now ...
hello! hello! --
don't give me shit - what do you want?
maybe she wanted a free trip to la. maybe they offered her money. massey is very seductive. who knows.
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day, mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
yes, sir. but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. he has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
captain, you know, i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
you're thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house,
so, do you think it's too much if i wear these in the same day?
there's no such thing as a psychic. people believe my folderol because i wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
brandon, i remember you from the convention, right?... you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and i spoke sharply to you...
who?
are you going to see sam again?
bob, can't you get them to wait for us? they're leaving us farther behind every day.
is there something i should know?
...i don't know what you mean....
okay! okay!
where did you meet miss lawson?
but now you can't go.
who died?
our john doe! the one i made up! look, genius— now, look. suppose there was a john doe—and he walked into this office. what would you do? find him a job and forget about the whole business, i suppose! not me! i'd have made a deal with him!
i'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
i will.
well that ought to be about the end of that.
no, i'm not.
you sure you wanna meet her? don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. she's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
yah.
we had given up digging in a certain barrow. i went back and i tried again. i just had a hunch.
they think i offed the director.
it's about eleven thirty.
at our press conference tomorrow, i think we should announce our plans to explore the world. not just a few leggy 36d's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
your honor, that's trial by ambush!
say, boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie.  him and charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
the families who control the casinos?
give me that!
it's not like i'm trying to attack you --
long enough to shoot back.
hi, al!
oh.
there's some sort of lock here. you say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. how does it work? do you see some of them again? do you forget others? do you write them now and then? how do you manage it?
you mean a farm?
exactly  so, you going to bogey lowenbrau's thing on saturday?
you get the eye?
put it in the middle of the room!
actually, i was a whole lot more interested in the cook's phenomenon when i was about your age. i've kind of lost interest since i've been working for them...
have you had a chance to think about --
you got the money?
this is a dead end.  you took us into a dead end!
no, actually, she was referred to me.  she was dr. hagman's patient...
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. you don't need to be pandering flesh. it's nonsense. it's beneath you.
you never spoke to me before.
bright enough to be dangerous.
ah... it's nothing.
don't name them.  just tell me if you know.
shut the fuck up, donny!  v.i. lenin! vladimir ilyich ulyanov!
did i say something?
dressed up like a million dollar trouper trying hard to look like gary cooper.
they sabotaged me.
you don't have to talk about it.
nothing.
are you busy?
<u>i'm</u> making the run to the cat.
heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for skywire apps.  you'll be working with her.
and listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? you all right? okay.
memo e-7 on top will cover the details.  an abandoned vietnamese army base in the north-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  as you can see the intelligence is soft.  these landsat photos show huts... barracks.  it could be anything.
nothing?
you don't happen to know where mr. mulwray's having lunch?
yes, air.
nothing.  there's no safe under here.
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
you're hitting on me?
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself. do you take a test or something or just sign up?
i... don't know... what do you want from me?
never been here before?
why?
who's the honcho around here?
liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
you were saying...
you know those little dogs you see people with?
that's not what i meant.
you're seeing bugs where they don't exist, striker.
this happened way before we both got married. i... i can't believe it.  you think she had sex with him?
he was re—enacting charles manson's labianca murders.
your spidey senses tingling.
...i don't get it.
well... i can't think of anything.
but i'd arranged to go home with you myself.
swell!
it's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
valerie's crying!
it must be his. i don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
ahh...tell me. what do you want to do for me? what's your idea?
musta got some primo bondsman.
november.  '71.
a man should have a hobby.
i was only hoping to make you understand.
d'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
then riding together.
who's the squirt?
--i don't want your trophy and i don't give a shit about it! 'cause i knew you when!! you and jack and tom sanders. i knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
uncle, how are you feeling?
he's passionate.
i'm finished at three.  no.  squash with stan.
you didn't call the sandwich joint with a urgent message?
you believe me, don't you?
can i get you something else? i mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
don't worry about it.
oh, sit down, man. what you tasting? i'm buying.
money.  a fortune.  money lying on the ground.  murray?  when was the last time he went out on a sit? sales contest?  it's laughable. it's cold out there now, john. it's tight.  money is tight.  this ain't sixty-five.  it ain't.  it just ain't.  see?  see?  now, i'm a good man--but i need a...
she's got no fucking pulse.
you know, we're okay. they're not finding us. you'll remember me in the morning. and you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
what was here, mr. rodd?
sort of, funny boy. if i tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of beachwood canyon. there's a corral up there where he'll be.
it's wonderful, mr. kane.  wonderful. wonderful.
long ago...
get a dance yet?
what's going on?
it is the sacred place that matters, charles -- not the size.  am i correct, bishop?
you have something to say, yamamoto?
what the fuck are you talking about? i converted when i married cynthia! come on, dude!
hey, put it back!  we're takin' off.
harry tasker.  one zero zero two four.
what are you looking for, colonel?  what's your name?
you better not say you missed that.
yes, general kutusov, i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  another lesser possibility might be to march on st. petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
...is, old pete!  come on, baby!
the virus itself might have positive applications.  they'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  greg isn't joining us?
he wasn't drinking. ray fell asleep at the wheel.
i'll drink to that. will you join me, miss --
you're lying about one thing, lester.
people have different emotional levels that --
mikey look at this--
like a lowjack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. it pulses at 230 giga-hertz.
uh, ninety days. and now i just have to go once a week. see, i'm rehabilitated.
you said -
what are you doing?
so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much?
good to be aboard, gentlemen.
young? she arrived here in 1888. she was 20 at the time. she was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
oh christ!  oh christ!
well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
stacy. what does it matter? he's a stereo salesman. you want to marry him? you want to have kids with him? you want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little pacific stereo badge on? come on.
yes.
mr. president, just what do you think you're doing?
take it easy.  just take it easy.  we're here to do business.
hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
yeah.
wait a minute-
what about drake, did he ever show up?
why should i want to get out of here? this is where i live.
that's because you don't have any women.
we got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
they're all human beings
you would?
no... you're not.  but the price has just gotten too high.
i think he's telling the truth.
i ain't trying to rob you...
they've never been separated before.
wednesday, thursday, friday.
our echo.
they will serve salad.
o.k.  g'night.  i got to pick up my scooter.  see you tomorrow.
what do you think?
okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
wouldn't bet against her.  tell you what i will do--bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france.  not a hundred, though--just fifty.
or i might end up with a broken nose.
look, elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
we both have shiny happy fits of rage. you want more fans, i want more stage. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls. i will not wear them tonight.
that's close enough, major.
eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
i am a fool.
now you must listen to me. this force is like a parasite, or a virus. it feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
extract of pineal!
you just say. i'm not really --
deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
i don't think there's any sense in --
where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
so it did.
well, i just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
i told 'em i'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? i don't think so.
he'll be ok.
why doesn't palmdale p.d. just raid the guy?
... since eight o'clock last night...!  you're in love.
no. i'll take a strega.
her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. first time in a long time she's been willing.
did he pay you for this?
v'ger plans to literally <u>meld</u> to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns...
you talk to max today?
what?
i don't understand. you just said he said no.
hey, i got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus i haven't billed a minute of my time since i started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like i'm rich or something.
that's what it looks like!
people sure like those misery books.
turn yourself in.
you're not touchin' that car.
luciano is dead?
when we backed you--
what's that got to do with us?
trust me ...
...we're saved!
i already stole it.  last week or whenever it was, in west palm.  i can't be stealing it again, can i?
isn't it unusual for an asian to be accepted into a cuban prison gang?
contracts? -- yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
so am i.  just trying to get by.
bad mood? i'm standing with the cast of "the godfather."
to infinity and beyond!
the king pipeline.
oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.
well, shit.  could be worse.  i mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
you're a fool.  now put her back.
this is the home of an angel.
what did you say?
you need a coat!
you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? how stupid is that?
you've got sand, for a maid.
maybe it's this mix tape i made you. or maybe these flowers. he gives jessica the flowers and tape.
did you know that whitney houston's debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number-one singles on it? did you know that, christie? whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
maybe we should ask jessica to join the class.
i told him where i was from a few days ago. it was just a casual conversation.
he a dog babydoll. he a great dane. i tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. he hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
but i don't know, sol. i never heard of sol. i'd just get in trouble. that's why we shouldn't go see about diane selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
...like i said, i'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
did sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
you ever been in love?
you're hurt.
who turned off the internet computer...
o-kay. we'll cook up some soup and put it in a coke. sick, eh? now should it be chicken-noodle or bean-with-bacon?
we're hoping it's only a temporary problem, admiral...
i'm goin'. you on the list?
whoa, i have serious space issues, dude. what do you want?
sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. only ten of us made it back.
nice performance back there. where'd you learn that, mike ditka sensitivity seminar?
killing lessons?  heartwarming.
who is it?
my father taught me.
mom and dad said it's yours. they seem to think you're coming home.
i should be in by two.
c4, plastic explosive.
daphne -
he's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  i'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
sir? i would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the lord's name in vain again.
food, moron.
that's all i wanted to know.
then all you have to do is untrigger it.
i don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, i'm starting to think rorschach may have been right.  is laurie okay?
flowers is pretty. i've always thought that.
jud, why am i doing all this?
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place?
hejira.
so he fooled you.
i'll be there in 5 minutes.
how many other silent partners are there, frank? donna?  little cindy? hell, let's give eddie a vote.
i do care about you!
no, let me!
we were parceled out, all five of us. i went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. she was in charge.
well, you can help me. my name's marge gunderson -
happy birthday.
stop what?
you really believe all that?
gray has no need to threaten. you remember the trial?
yeah.
not lately.  did you check messages?
i'm gonna do whatever i wanna do with it.
it can be.
girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
quaid!  that's quaid!
go ahead, miss sutton.
boy, mr. lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  when is your next picture coming out?
this is betty at twelve.
you better not either.
boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
well, i'll go in and have a bite.
where are you going?
ours.
i'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, mrs. otto, but the walkers said you would understand.  i know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
...a dewars on the rocks and a bud, please.
how's it feel, tommy?
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
that's what i said.
the longer the air force hits the iraqis, the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage.
ms. thompson.
johnnie, i can't tell you, honey. is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? we've got to find them kids.
i’ll be alone.
ohhh-hh, ohhh...
you know what i al'ays said: "tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." can't keep no joad in jail!
steven, conor didn't die.
i hope ilene's all right.
hold this thing up for a week.  two weeks if you have to...
i can't bear to see you cry.  what is wrong?
oh, my babies.
i just kept reading them over and over. i know when i finish this one-- and i've only got two chapters to go-- i'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
oh, what, in this section of town?
i won't do that.
half a million.
yah, well, they exist all right.
yeah.
who's dying?
you set to go -
two more nights in this lunar cycle.
good lord, fella! i'm talking about your boss.
it was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. but i had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  oh, i lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
i'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. i'm talking about working for a living. sharking.
oh?  how long you been doing this?
what do you mean?
he's still asleep.
er, don't you want to search me?
the way i acted, in the snow...you must think i’m a coward.
well, i mean, i meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
five steeds and a few hackneys...
we'll still be able to talk when i'm away. the conversation will just keep getting longer.
the ones who could disburse the money.
where do you think i might find maurice?
darling!
you mean...it wasn't that terrible?
yes, i would!
mr. rielly? my name is mark kincaid. i'm with the l.a.p.d. are you aware	of last night's events?
what about the girl?  brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  is that a coincidence?
good morning.
steak's really good tonight. scooby  good.
oh, but doctor. isn't this wonderful. to live -- to live -- in the grand hotel.
you manifested that, beth.
oh, all right.
since when did you guys start changing tires?
alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
look. i know i have a case. if you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
now we've got a straight shot, due north, to ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, st. mere, then bernay.  we'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
the swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
how many men?
forty-two minutes ahead.
i'll tell you what.  i know how much this means to you.  i'll try to get her to plug the film.  i'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
what...?
nothing much. i just think he's a fake, that's all.
i looked in the library. they got covers with nothing inside them.
i had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. that there would be...a lasting darkness.
he is exhausted.
tell me, doreen, did the police say anything?
rose, i have a serious favor to ask you.
but you did -- i just heard it.
right.  in the middle.  of the floor.
when did you start to feel this way?
i'm sorry.
that's it. the boom-boom room. sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
everybody knows why she went over tod.  you jibed the boat.
okay.   how much?
colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
oh ny god... oh my god... oh my god...
you were ok for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but i think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though i told you that we had plenty at home. in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. i asked you if you knew it was a hundred. you said you did, so i let you do it. we got here, you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed.
i reckon.
why do you say that?
i sure like the way he talks. it sounds like a race car motor idlin'. it makes me not be nervous.
what?
he wants to show now.
i don't like it, george...
i think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
no he didn't.
now i ca-can't remember.
sven!
good. fine. now where's my parachute?
phillip?
oh that? just mulling over business problems. examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip.
we are both from prague.
you have not slept with your husband for five years?
with the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  redwood forests.  oceans. mountains --
ain't she goin' to take the boy?
where criminals can come in here... they take the...
and talking is talking! well, i think we better get on.
then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
what sales...?  i just closed eighty-two grand...are you fuckin'...i'm back...i'm back, this is only the beginning.
that's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
yes!
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
...if i don't come back tell mother i love her.
you see the old woman? that will never happen to you. you'll never grow old. you will never die.
no thanks.
don't take my daddy! please don't take my daddy!
i turned him down flat.
no.
great. what brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
you taking sides against me, now, frank?
i am.  i'm here.
ilsa, i --
bring the crane over.  come down. easy down.
uri geller must be on the premises someplace.
love you, dil.
i think i can handle that one.
if we keep going up, they'll catch us!
really? you small town guys are good. and have you located sidney's father?
that's fine, mr. kane.
she's okay. looks like some boys were teasing her. himbry's shutting down the school though. i want you to take look around.
you all right?
no you haven't.
you look like george washington.
i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.
no.  i told him to.  i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
yeah.
more or less.
know what this is?
...screw you, yoyo.
don't make it worse, dad.
hey, you're good! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
i don't.  so, no.
"your movie"?!  i wish it was your movie!  i wish i hadn't blown every dime i ever made into this stinkbomb. if i ever see you again, i'll kill you!!!
yes.
next i want to see rachel.  put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  keep her calm.  tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
where are we going?
kathy costello. that's my maiden name.
mnunn.  cold lately.  that night, couple weeks ago.  that was <u>real</u> cold.  remember that?
pinback, i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
when i was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
if it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  got a toothpick?
surely you'll grant me a final word.
it was at that.
yes.
it's a logistical nightmare. close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
yes. that could be true.
the 'coffee shop' --
well, some fiend might.
no, not really.
oh, him. he has a cat of his own. but his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw. goofy, if ya ast me.]
wow.
well, we can take my truck then.
my agent.  i called my agent.
what was it, jack?
that's sarah?  i can see what you mean.
no.
all right, i'll go up there and take care of this myself.  you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.
let's just keep going.
jeffrey? what's going on?
i’m sorry but mr gluck is not answering, sir.  would you like to leave a message?
i'll call you back.
there's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in caen.
wait --
that's not the issue here, those people are.  he can't do it alone.
so you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
faith, here it is. i think it best you marry with this paris. o, he's a lovely gentleman. i think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
he admitted it.
pardon me?
how come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
well, that's very interesting.
something the matter?
no problem.
i can't.  i gotta go home.
it's the truth, i swear.
oh, not that.  you promised you'd burn it.
see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...  and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
no trouble.
d'amour --
at least stay for a drink.  this party's for you.
beyond the stream.  i think i know.
what's the matter with you?
is that what i did, now? and of course, you can prove all of it.
then where's the money?
never mind that. what's the story?
i used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it.  i'd just as soon not have one anyway. i hate those damn things.
you?
back.  neck.  back.
christ, you don't know what's out there!
who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
you will go out there.
gosh, pop--head of the boy rangers!
...perceval!
i don't know about you, but i could use a drink... i'll buy you one.  it'll be my good-bye present.
why are you suddenly so mad at me?
that's enough, fran.
none of your business.  god.
i'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
didn't you hear me, grandpa? or you got your hearing aid turned down?
thank you, madame.  come on now - courage. play me something you know.
sorry, hon. happy birthday...
stop it. what're you, crazy?
thank you, friend.
but if i tell you it is - as i just did. were you listening to me?  isn't that enough?
why... ?
and exactly what business are you in, mr. bond?
what?
he's dead isn't he?
sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... when i was fifteen, mama told me that pretty soon i'd be startin' to think about sex, and i should talk to her before i did anything about it.
hello.
it's the way it happened, i know it is.
we definitely want it to have junk.
what are you doin' up again, frank? you need to get a little sleep.
you know, i... don't know.
actually. if you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
please.
oh my god!  bernie!
does he know that?
my stock's falling.  isn't yours? those pennies are costing me millions.
i'll help you. to begin with, you'd like to know what i'm doing here. whether i was born here.
i'm curious to see what it's like. i'm very curious, rose.
yeah, i mind.  you bet your ass i mind.
elaine, i mean the mission has to be aborted.  this ship should never have passed fsa inspection.  this thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
how many with you?
tactical analysis, mister worf.
yes.
yeah, she's a ten, max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
if you pull this off, i can't promise i won't kill you.  i mean, who we trying to kid?  but i will spare the flying nun here....
yeah, but you said you've never met him. how did you--
"the worst i can do is starve to death." listen to you.
what did i fuckin' do?... in the middle of the lakeview.
nothing you gotta say do i wanna hear right now. so save yourself saying it.
why would she come here...
murman!
she is only the <u>princess</u> of cool. <u>mommy</u> is the queen!
what is bruce doing ?
my momma's a beautician. guess that's where i get it from. she wouldn't hear of my moving in with early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. ain't seen her in nearly a year now. i wish she'd call me, just once.
i don't want to go back.
jill. i was thinking of getting a lawyer. maybe you can help me.
there's ... another exit?
pretty low all around.
tricks...jesus...
good night, theo.
you said 48 hours!
thanks you.  so, that's it? we're done?
what?
go on! get out!
how soon can we pull this off?
you talk to any reporters?  any press?
miss scott, you're not making any sense.
on tape?
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant?
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism. i wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. but as soon as i tried to do something about it, i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell.
what is her name?
i don't know what i'm supposed say, mary. i want to do the right thing here.
father...
how you doing, brewer?
better go.  grierson hates people being late.
hi.
you ok?
ready, uncle lex?
when you figure on branding?
okay, we're in business.
what's the matter?
you've grown, big program.
up to you.
mitchell was dead enough.
yeah - josephine.
look, rod, just get on the camel!
i ... i ... wasn't feeling well ... i.. i was sleeping... i don't know anything ... i ... i'm all mixed up and ...
one guy do all the damage?
why did he shoot her?
it's freezing.
i don't want it to taste different. i don't know why i bother. is that enough for you? hey!
you're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. maybe you've just got powers of precognition. well, maybe you're just out of whack.
no - that's not it!  she said her boyfriend stranded her up there! i didn't ask her to come with me!
you're killing him!
anybody talk to the press?
ramón were not getting weaker. we're stronger than ever before.  they're getting weaker. they thought they could break our picket line. and they failed. and now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
yeah. it wasn't tom.
look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.
i don't want to go there.
you should... mind it.
we'll torch the bases, how's that?
i'm free. i can never thank you enough.
where do i sign?
what are they peeking at? captain waldowski in the shower?
<i>                      this is a thing called a present. the whole thing starts with a box...</i>
i'd really like to see mr. dardis.
how'd ya like hearin' ya name on tv?
aren't  you forgetting something?  your coupon.  we gotta have it.
what?
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
you refused to comply with a direct order.
jonathan?
what's wrong with the water next to your bed?
well there's a few choice lps in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
sure, dave, what's up?
what do you see here?
do you have something against traveling?
eddie mack, that cop.  and jeremiah.  and even when he's done, who knows.  he won't be satisfied.  just like that demon dog. feed it, and it just grows hungrier. feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  who knows where it'll stop. that kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
who?
good morning, liz.
two hours, tops.
what's wrong, annie? you're not smiling.
name?
what'd christine say?
did i act stupidly last night? should i apologize?
i know you do, darling.
where you been, anyway?
we'll be forced to shut the doors. i've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. you've all made money out of it. are you willing to help?
we've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. i was framed. i was innocent.
i don't know what to do.
of course --
well, i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which i now see means us all.
neil -- what --
no, actually joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
who is she this time?!
two of us might be more effective than one.
if you got something to say, say it.
but you didn't hurt --
he kept saying, "let it happen, let it happen."  then he just stopped.
don't worry about jaeger.  he uses his personality as a form of birth control.
i hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
have a little snort?
it's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
thanks for the speakers.
exactly. and then -- maybe -- not right away -- there's a room right off the bedroom -- it would be perfect for a nursery.  it's a walk in humidor right now -- but if i took out the refrigeration unit --
he said open it.
it's hard to describe.
romeo.
there's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
never mind bontecou.  i've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and i'm putting them to see old man.
how about you? briefs or boxers?
stolen?
i've met you before.
do we have enough fuel to make it back to earth?
if you enjoy it, you should do it.
the only proof is those bodies.
mighty decent of you, pal.
in every way.
they're degenerates. there's not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over.
no problem.
it's on national television, barnett.
i wasn't with you.
liza?
the one that goes into the woods--sure.
--i know, i know, the pressure's off the white house and it's all back on the post--
daddy, did ya see that?
i heard there was a poetry reading.
welcome aboard, admiral. i believe you know my trainee crew. certainly they have come to know you.
hello?
no, you know what? it's not you, man. it's not anybody. it's me. whoo! hey.
maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the government!
i don't believe it.
but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
aye, sir. on course to ceti alpha. all is well.
well, obviously, we got to go back.
my name is father seamus.  i'm from holy rood church.
you're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing.
this can't be happening?
i don't know but that used to be a window and i think that was a door.
more than enough.
hello?
i don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
how long has it been -- a month?
do us a favour?
nonsense.  you're a fey creature with mad ideas.  but you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
san francisco's a long way from here.
what's this?
it's imperative that you get that truck moving.
here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in havana.
i'll be seeing you.
shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. i was a fixin' on trading it to jackie cobb.
i'm sorry.  i had a wretched night.
ma'am, i am the deputy of this town.
why not go to work for me?
i like women who wear mismatched earrings.
i'm talking about the letter, asshole.
it's a juice and coffee bar, man, like i been tellin' ya --
accelerating to warp one, sir.
please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? like who you were before the tailspin. do you remember that guy? people love that guy. and don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
we're going to be moving, son.
you know, when you gave him a beatin'.
constantinople?
his what?
his moods at this time were complex and varied.
well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
i'll always be with you now. now and forever.
no, you don't.
i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. the older one wanted head of the cdc.
no, please; an advance on your salary.
it's rather a disappointment these days.  it isn't there any more.
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
too much blue in crimson.
seven months.
-- leo was an apple, that's right. red on the outside, white on the inside. and jimmy hated him. kicked his ass a coupla times. but he didn't kill him.
we must wait. one day the curse will pass. one day a dead man will... will...
that's what i'd like to know.  she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
whatever you wish...  this has all been a terrible mistake, gregor.  i wanted to play straight with you, but edvard insisted we try and kill you.
blue square for belvedere, ohio, where the bimmel girl was abducted. blue triangle where her body was found - down here in missouri. same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. this new one, today... washed up here.  elk river, in west virginia, about six miles below u.s. 79. real boonies.
the left.  it's more natural.  hey, i've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  what would that be made of?
of course not; not now! you're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. well, i won't let you. i want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. and when she dumps you again- and she will, dante, i promise you that-when she dumps you again, i want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  i'm just glad randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
now, you just find him, son.
no.
well, maybe you better do that, then.   you know you guys are all the same. you don't care who gets hurt. you're a bunch of whores.  you'd do anything for a dollar.  you got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
who did it have anything to do with... vickie?
that's your problem.
did you ever hear of the s. cooper trust robbery?
it's not the girl, jack.  sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  you may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
never mind that. if you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
i feel for you, but we got an emergency here. it's a weekend of full moons.  everyone's called in sick. larry, veeber, stanley too. we need bodies out there. i had to put marcus on twelve young. you know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
thank you.
i'm not going anywhere!
let's say i do want her dead.  what is it you want?  this morning you weren't a killer.
i thought we all had separate rooms.
you should do something about this lock.
hello -- hello! is this the lying -- in hospital? did you have an auto accident in the last --
oh, now i'm a bad housekeeper!
the hoi polloi.  doesn't it mean the herd?
who is it?
i won't waste your time and catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already. i only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... let me help you now, and i'll trust you when it's all over.
you have tranquilizers?
i wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
where do i meet you?
what'd he say?
look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  now get dressed...  you’re not wearing that to the thompsons’ party. i don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
oh, god...
why's that?
no.  i don't think so.
you manipulated me into this...!
mom--i mean, dad?
didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  it was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  you ruined the lives of four people --
she what?!
we are concerned about more than casablanca. we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
where did it come from?
what's happening here?
what?
they'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. and if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. we'll get 'em all right. i gotta piss. i'm gonna use your commode.
alright?
did you ask him to come visit?
if i should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. that's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. if you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
huh?
perhaps a little refreshment first? a little coffee, or a little chocolate?
i see. you realize, however, that you committed a crime?
what's the matter, paul? you haven't written a word.
may i ask why...?
my dear niece -- i must ask you not to interfere.  war is not a woman's problem.
why should that make such a difference?
come on!
excuse much!  not rude or anything.
what?
because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
jesus.  how'd you know about snoopy?
god, this is so corny.  have we been reduced to this?  sheets?
that's not all, frances. mr. bebe is very concerned about your politics. he hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
a hit.
combat operations center, major mandrake speaking.
you haven't, you're just late.  oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.
u-huh.
you... i should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
i'm interested in long-term expectations.
so maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... and you're gonna get burned, baby... and besides that, you're shit... d'you think i'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
up here on the fifteenth floor?
come, thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. they'll be leaving any minute.
someone to see you, dan'l!
i haven't got that much in cash.
is that all you have to say?
well, i probably wouldn't say if i were, but no.
it's called "the philosophy of time travel".
this is a gift you'll not return.
yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. after the rains.  look good as new.
uh, well, what'd she say? is pony coming?
uh, this is our paleobotanist, dr ellie.....
i've seen the same.  i'm not the country hick you seem to think i am.
your mother?
you know, up the jeep trail.
none of us can remember that night. i get flashes of it but they don't make sense. we saw shrinks for years. but nothing they did could ever touch it. what happened? was there ever an offensive?
his technician okay? in addition to the looks department?
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
tell me, gordon--when does it all end? how many yachts can you waterski behind? how much is enough?
you did?
oh!
and if we have to go to siberia...
so <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
you gotta excuse him. yesterday he didn't know pinot noir from film noir.
yes. i sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. tomorrow we leave for arrakis! arrakis is real. the harkonnens are real.
then why don't you leave?  just give me one good reason.
it sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. it seems to me she has the right idea--.
yes—if he is your husband.
boy, you must be pissed.
i don't accept that.
what? this?
may i pet the deer?
if you don't sleep, you don't dream. if you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
well, my boy, you're a hero.
there were five stones in the beginning. over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
you blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  i'd be pissed off too if i was her.
it's the president's personal property!  i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedy-loving harvard democrat cocksuckers!

i'll tell you one thing though.
they've done a fine job. hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
who cares?!  we're on a roll!  these are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
hey!
hey lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something i think you should look at.
you don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
what is happening around here!!!
you do have a vivid imagination, mr lombard. i only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. i fail to understand your purpose in this. still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
maybe i could try --
well, there's nobody special!
do they come with batteries?
let go!
will you be here?
well? supper at my place?

i want that fucking radio!
you don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
he's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
i will if you want to.
what?
ah, that is good.
thank you.  thank you very much.
hey!
you're so nice.
ah, coffee. smells good.
evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  simple butchers like you are obsolete!
my prom was so boring. we all flew to paris the next day to recover . . . sometimes my whole life seems boring. i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. then i remember how smashing i look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. you think i'm silly, don't you?

maybe.
-- i'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. didn't matter how much cash i made pulling wet jobs -- i was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like jon archer after me.  the best part is -- i'm the good guy.
just the last three weeks.
you've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
i told you not to bring the other one.
hold on, damn it.  we're getting nowhere... if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
shut up!  just shut up, you idiot!!
it has its virtues.  it hasn't fallen down yet....
intruder alert!
make it ice cold.
i wouldn't say anything--i would act.
this just isn't the best moment for this.
has harry spoken with jerry?
i have plenty of friends.
close call.  for the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. life's tenuous.
i can't do it, shelly...

deadline?
zee.
freddie?

oh, shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
ugh... you guys, seriously... i'm having cheesy poof withdrawal...
yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
what? to completely damage me?  to send me to therapy forever? what?
i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  he's a cop?
okay, who's the head teller here?
do you want an argument or an answer?
and them fingers, them chubby fingers. and that stroke. it's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
are you gettin' wise with me?
call your friends in the army. call someone. victor is harmless. this is a mistake.
he's a director.
you seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
see what happens when i don't have my orange juice?  the human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
who's that?
long gone... marvosa well you won't mind if i don't take your word for it, right?
beautiful night huh?
it's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. for twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. and then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
uh-huh. mi raccomando. [italian- american slang for 'i'm counting on you']
well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
i just have a good feeling about you. haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
deadwood, is that what it's called? cool, will you show us?
and would you describe those years as happy?
you're not going anywhere, harry.
it's not safe here.  the whole country's crawling with bandits and germans and god knows what.  it's madness.  i can't allow it. you're not, this is natural - it's shock. for all of us.  hana -
what?
this a private clambake, or can anybody join?
hey, bomb...
was he a good man?
she's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. please sit down, harold. i'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
if we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
like amnesia.
i have to check the upper lines.  gabor will drive you back.
how much did you figure to make?
do it.
let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
we can't touch hoover --
where are you going?
then what?
nothing. [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far.
what if it is?
want to know what i think happened?
regulations, mr. stanwyk. and you and your wife, named....
you have some weird friends. what does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
screw regulations!  four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
i'm not leaving.
the adventures of tom sawyer.
i was tired.
well, well. in a real hurry, are we?
down- i'm-i'm goin' uptown.
the union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
but it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, it's a goya reproduction. those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in western art.
she says i can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
that's fine, mr. kesher. you can pay cash when you check out. i'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
what's the matter with you?
oh, right. daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
why take the chance?  just let me go down there with you...
it's good to see you involved.
orchids come again, madam -- no card -- i think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. last night for instance --
alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
not much danger here, ma'am, i wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of edinburgh.
you'd slow us down and put margo in danger.
we have never been friends.
glass will cut glass, mrs. langtry. do you know where it was purchased?
i'll find your table in a moment. braddock. not braniff? we have a braniff.

over three hundred miles.
there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.
do you know who i am?
hi. this is nikki. leaves a message. 
how does someone get meningitis?
what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
oh, save it. we've still lots of things to do.
there you go, preacher man. get me drunk so i don't stick my foot up yo ass.
--no--
i want to know what happened.
get your clothes on, lady --
we found his spit in the dead director's eye. he's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  what more do you want?
he didn't <u>give</u> me--
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
you wouldn't know her address, would you?
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
right.
the ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
a very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
jesus holly, we got enough time.
she wasn't in...you were al...
you can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  then you start to feel...unlucky.
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... asking all these questions about the sacred stones..at the time i didn't think anything of it.. what was his name? i'm so bad with names...
come on, drink up.
don't be so sure. i like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
dave, if you've a minute, i'd like your advice on something.
good-bye.
you're wrong.
i didn't have much choice.
no problem.  here's the...
guzman, tomas, esteban --
the old crazy woman who lives off old gun road.
so that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
let's go, c'mon, get up --
the mask is because you think it might be...catching?
not too sweet! you make it too sweet they don't eat it.
he look familiar?
yeah, it's not bad. usually ann has some serious salt action going. i keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
colonel washington?  colonel nathanael greene, rhode island militia.
what... ?  not you too?
no, i don't.  you should've left a long time ago.
hello?
thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. i want you to program one special command into all these systems. tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. can you do that, pal?
it's not even yours.
we call them zippers.  they're not supposed to be a challenge.
probably for three weeks or so anyway. i'm not sure -- i don't get how it works.
you've got to learn why things work on a starship.  it's coming through now, khan...
why, yes, jaeger.  i believe it is.
you want something?
making ends meet, huh.
tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
.....have you ever seen this..i mean, never mind, you said --
he just got accepted to the fleet academy. isn't that great ?
come on.
now i know i didn't hurt nobody when i was drunk - -
data?

yes, general savitzky?
jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, jean d'aulon.  jean... i place her in your care.  find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
i wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
you need to explain it.
fox says bluestar just hit 23. what do you want him to do?
yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
my what?
where's regan?
okay... but i would like to know about the other cadets. what they were like -- nice guys?
hey butt-head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
right now, you're doing nothing?
there's a spider in the bathroom.
you're conceited--
he does? you're sure?
surely, sit down. if i had known you were coming, i would have thrown you up a waffle.
i am not third world ugly.  women like me, they think i'm cute.  like snoopy.
detective carter from the haddonfield p.d.
no, but i have to admit i thought about it.
where?
let go of me!
it is dead.
this is like my every wet dream come true.  i don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
he said, sing the devil away!
thirty even.
i'll tear his head off.
you mean, you're a thief?
her husband left her
great. i've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
i'm sorry, miss arroway, not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
...isn't it perfect!
somebody robbed the vatican.
good morning, mr. brandon.
well, she's not crazy about him.
i think playing in a band called "bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
people will talk.
one idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
ravenous. what about you?
used to what?
so come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 jesus christ, the world is off its rocker. i made $37,000 last year and you...
no. the files are spotless. whatever they find, it's just going to make conklin look worse.
you know what's happened, don't you?
we're outnumbered twenty to one.
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
good. more coffee?  robert, i hope you don't mind my asking, but i feel like i should.
you...you dirty bird. she can't be dead. misery chastain cannot be dead! how could you?
what do we do now?
or rosebud?  how about it, jerry?
what's the matter?
fletch, you want an apology?
check this out.
what do you want from me? i did what you said.
whatta you so happy about?
...you know... who *who* is?
mayors come and go.  and heirs tire easily.  really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with muhammed shreck.
and you're a fool, toddy -- and no doctor. it's only the dead ones that you know.
it was freaky, i'll tell you.  stupid kid.
you don't even know me.
you don't own this man!
s-s-stuff.
it's santa muerte. death worship. the religion of la hermanidad. there's a curse on you.
how do i know if this is love ?
i wasn't gonna --
shit.
how?
yes.
no, mr. rasczak doesn't do that at all. he sorta discourages you really.
as to that, i don't know, charlie... we hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
i wouldn't -
if there is, develop it!
commander, i'm showing two son'a ships on an intercept course.
what am i gonna eat?
wait...  she's crying. i finish. i hold up my finger like "wait a second". they sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. i look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. even the camera guy.
i came back for some of the books. i am trying to straighten out the accounts. i don't hope to impress you, but i may as well tell you: we haven't a farthing!
the sun turning black.
yeah; it was great money... i could make a dollar a day, sometimes. but only in summer. when it got cold, i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing.
if you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, i think i could win the nobel prize.
where's bill?
you know what gets me?
only can i still see him?
maybe i should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
oh, bill, i'm going to miss you so much.
what are you doing?
yeah?
i used to be kind of wild. they used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
how many months are you?
uh, well, that's okay - i don't dance, heh, heh...
to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes.
no -- something real.  something no one else knows.
you okay?
well -- i guess i'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
a hundred bucks a date.
oh, impressive wingspan.  very good!
i ought to get some sleep.
mikey--
of course.  of course.
you know, i've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. i think you're on to something.
dude, this is smokey.  look, i don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and i know it wasn't your fault, but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round.  or maybe forfeit it to us--
mrs. dreyfuss, can i borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
she can't be here without me.
where's the others?
she said i was so much like you.  i said, no, i'm not.  i'm like i am because of you, but i'm not you, not as good as you. everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  but you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. you made me who i am.
good evening...  doug.  i'm dr. lull.
how do you know this?
well, that's why i'm here. she wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
love them so much that they ought to love you back. only you want love on your own terms. "
this is mighty sweet, paden. i think i finally found my place in the world.
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard.
so far so good.
where is pancakes hause?
hey... you guys ok?
employer?  the president?
this isn't going to be a problem, is it?
you worm!
i've wanted to talk to you for some time.  for a long time, actually. i said, "the machine, there's a man i would work with.  there's a man..." you know?  i never said a thing.  i should have, don't know why i didn't.  and that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  it was admirable...it was the old stuff.  hey, i've been on a hot streak, so what?  there's things that i could learn from you. you eat today?
we could make a run for it?
piano.
oh, i'm used to it. what makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  they ought to be grateful to have you.  i certainly am.
they hate each other --
ah, nothing.
that's kingsley. old bastard hears us, i'm sure. he just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. i know. i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. literally. [beat] you're the cop killer, right?
i can't do that.  if i tell them, they'll, if i <u>tell</u> them, they'll try bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
it's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
homer, you know i would never kill anyone--you know i wouldn't.
mom, i need to talk to you.
we have no money for a rug.
hey man.  what is it you're so involved with there?
i'm proud of you.
you're welcome.
you're too short for that gesture. besides, it went out with mrs. fiske.
very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. one of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
i've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
let's go.
yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
so. anything else?
i say, will you have a cigarette?
so what?
he's so fine...
what about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
good.
no. i wouldn't say that. national geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. they like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. i don't mind really. i'm not artist. i'd faced that a long time ago. it's the course of being well-adjusted. i'm too normal.
but it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
matzoh!  are you jewish?
sanchez...?
oh, please. i hope you're not going to run away this time.
five?
isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, von karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
thanks, walter, but it's no good. we tried it.
what i'm about to tell you is partially documented.  the freedom of information act saw to that. but much more of it isn't.  for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, i'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
it's fifty cents admission. it's applicable to a purchase.
die?  what...?
well, alan, i think we’re gonna have a banner year. sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
but surely...
...who...?
pinback...
no, sir.
your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
major!  some day i think you and i are gonna have a serious disagreement.
be careful!
reluctantly, i do. it would be a blessing to her and everyone else. the girl is oversexed and i say -- spay her!
rudolfo, you dirty pig!  pull over.
i've lived there.
we've got nothing to worry about. he's as naive as a child.
that's true. but what if they change the locks?
i'm tired of this game. please play without me.
any news of quaid?
yes. i loved my husband, rex.
frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  just give us the punch line...
and you'll be in all evening?
we have our own website now. we dedicated a whole page to you.
i don't know. maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
north ?
but...
my ass.  the only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
elroy, what happen?
we're police officers.
swimming with his hat on?  that's original.
hey, that's not so bad.  compare it to the love canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  so in legal terms, ten years is --
no, i'm afraid he's not. he's out at the moment.
martin! ride me as far as the well!
we paid him a million dollars. you'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
just did.  jealous?
yes. have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
oh.
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
it's not completely dry.
you don't want me to live with you?
yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
who do you think it is?
so why didn't you do it?
no.
hey, house is doin' well.  hey, all that money is rollin' in. i appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
i'm serious, man. don't mention it. ever.
that's not my handwriting.
oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
huh?
well, why does it?
i come not with peace but with a sword.
but that's not the point...
did chloe crack?
this letter was addressed to superman care of me.
1 saw you lead our cavalry sir
who's side are you on?
they'll kill him!  he has no idea!
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out.
you are master of all you survey.
that's right.
frankie, come in. good to see you.      you want something?
how close?
just a walk, for chrissakes.
it's nearly eight. i'm off duty shortly, then i'm off to the films with alex.
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
naturally.
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
i'll be back around nine.
fine.
you sure? it's my favorite shirt, mind if i check?
i'd need an introduction. from someone he trusts. someone who owes us a favor.
you follow me out here for a reason?
sorry -- i shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. are you sure you're going to be okay?
i think you look beautiful.
it's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. you don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
how much do you think she's talking about?
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... we were a lot closer than evelyn realized.
aw shit.
what do you think it is?
you did good...
she's really sick you know.  don't you know what she's doing?  she knows i went to berkeley.  she knows i knew noah.  she makes up that story about me.  she's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
what's down there?
maybe i don't like the way you ask.
i told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. well, won't you sit down?
but, they were there i counted 803 votes.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the united states senate!
well, don't worry about your fiancee.  we'll watch over her.
they killed our friend. it's personal now. besides, if we do that, then julien died for nothing. the tapes are the key.
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. hit was bloody-like around that towel. hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
yessir.  there's a report here from every state along the east coast. want to hear them?
yes.
what?
the ship will sink.
aha!  hello!  you're mildred, right?
i wanted to let his family know....
how much more?
my crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
dunbar.
to be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
...eliminated one.  swat's on the next two...
they survived above.  became what they are.
yes.
what is this? does everybody know everything i'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
i'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
no, no, not tonight.  don't let her in here.  i have too much to do.
very instructive
yes, ma'am.
i can handle it. besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. and you are in no position to be jealous.
i understand...
i'm no easier to live with than he was.
can i kiss you too?
you okay, jim? how do you feel?
leave me alone, brother. i've never seen you before. tramp shouts to other meths drinkers and tramps.
yeah.
i want to try for san francisco. there are buildings there. steel and concrete!
no, bigger!  what's the biggest energy??
oh. hi.  sorry.
i don't know where he is.
mozart, i am a tolerant man. i do not censor things lightly. when i do, i have good reason. figaro is a bad play. it stirs up hatred between the classes. in france it has caused nothing but bitterness. my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. i do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
that's my father. i got to run.
it's not my father's money, it's the foundation's.  why did he think you had it?  and who does?
yes, it is, hal.
but you got to do it. you got to. can't nobody call like you. you have to be there.
hair?
smile... good?
easy there, partner -- i wasn't there.
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
do you have the tape?
careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
women are all you have on your mind!
you're mad! she's mad, wolfi.
don't i know it. come on in agent rodgers. sit down. always a... pleasure to see you. how can i be of help?
about thirty seconds.
i dunno, boy.
christ, jon!  how could you do this to yourself? how could you do this to us?  do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
$247.
sure.
holy! well. if you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
you have done well, saavik. as your sponsor at the academy i have followed your career with... satisfaction. and as a vulcan.
what else did he tell you?
was she?
i'll never get close to anybody.
i got there late, john.
it's a long story, this one.
where are they?
what's wrong?  what happened to gibarian?
you are a private investigator?
two of my men deserted last night. it happens from time to time. i assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
there's no question.  you don't have any.
they don't have that kind of potential.
like dancing?
four hundred and fifty and i'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
you're not pregnant, are you?
we can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
what you doing around here then?
i'm going to go powder my nose. 
the pentagon?
i -- i mean it's all right. it doesn't matter.  i'm -- my name is andrews, charlie andrews. i've come from india -- i've read a great deal about you.
why do i have to sleep with donnie? he stinks.
well, welcome to "hell"ton.
"need" is a good, solid word.
thanks, jerry.  tell me something.
she said yes.
absolutely right, shut up. lashings of apologies all round.
pour us a couple.
what do you mean?
four, counting the one in the chamber.
i grow it on my window-sill. the lights really great there and i'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
well, what about books?  you like hemingway?  you gotta love hemingway.
everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
there's no people like you in my crowd.
no,  i'm not going through there.
they're all on microfiche. what year are you looking for?
they go. john. they go.
you are sick, that's why he's here.
great jacket, teddy bear.
that's renee alright.
i didn't put nothin' up.
while he was here. you went about together?
it's weird being the groom.  all these things kimmy has to take care of...
a little bad luck?
no, she's fine.
happy hanukkah tikva.
i sure don't hate you.
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
why, haven't you—?
erik! row! what are you doing?
your boy, there--
so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? how do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
this looks like the best spot.
you want that for here or to go?
i miss him, matt.  i still can't believe he's gone.
what do you wanna know for?
packed to the ceiling. hurry -- get dressed. and what an audience -- the french ambassador -- american millionaires -- princess ratzville -- er -- er --
you really think sheldon's out there?
all right, then this is old stuff to you.
uh... hey baby. are we like, doing it?
you fuck me whenever you want... you don't call... tell me who she is.
thanks....
you're just trying to say all great stuff so i'll feel even worse that you're not around.
he can pilot?
planning on getting --
all right, what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need nornel one plus fifty's.
liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
i read your book. the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
who'd ever think, to look at you?
<cardiac red alert> we're stopping the heart.
you know, my dad's done some work for kaminski...
he was different.
i read the file. you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
i know you changed it to a bookstore. and the color of my hair.  but the moment was exactly the same.  the same, you know, dynamic.  and almost verbatim, wasn't it?
yes sir.
easy, easy,  easy, scotty. easy. you're back with us.
kinda like men.
just another sleepover at the riley's.
it sounds stupid.
for the focuser?
you let me go four years ago, jeff. only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
geoffrey's not in cairo.  he's not actually a buffoon.  and the plane wasn't a wedding present. it belongs to the british government.  they want aerial maps of the whole north africa. so i think he's in ethiopia.  in case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
why thank you.
who?
how you doing?
inspector brimmer
in the house?
no. you?
and he was there?
to you, too?
how come ... ?
just cover wood, maverick. mutual support, man!
the boss wants to see you.
we are being hailed.
you take her.
i know that.  what's it got to do with you?
i'm red this time.
[then what do you have to lose?]
i made it.
what wife? he don't have no wife.
put your fucking hands up!  don't move.
that was easy, wasn't it?
he'll be contacting us again.
i thought we were helping.
i can't. it's too big.
i'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  are you there yet?
the country's loving it.
don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
what if i lose it?
not yet. might just as well be. the only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
really. and where was that, old man?
there's a test, you know.
if he gives you grief, i'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
nothing is infallible, but so far the voight-kampff scale bas been foolproof.
i think i've met you before, mr. brett.
since the time of adams--not washington.
a man would look anywhere for her, mary. there is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
say phillip, want to see the northern lights?
it's one thing for kids. you get older, you nhave other things.
where'd you get this?
...worst possible time for me.
your tree.
that's it.  my client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
reluctant to speak, eh, chauncey? well, i can understand that. when a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. just give it some thought, work with the idea, i'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
shit.  hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  there was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
pardon me, i am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
isn't this ridiculous, doctor? six months i've been here and there are still times when i can't stand it. i just go to pieces.
ha, ha... all right, well, uh i guess you can bring out the pasta.
whoa, this kicks ass! huh huh huh.
you got some mighty fucking fine bad timing adam. we got a rehearsal situation here.
all i want is thirty-nine sixty. if you'll give me a check i'll get out of this place. it gives me the jitters.
you know those shotguns i sold ya, well i need 'em back.
yeah. but just how're we goin' to make out? i got to get me a job.
this is miles from the battle lines. they were probably deserters.
looks like a chipmunk.
there.
why can't we wait here for a ride?
why, who did you see?
just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
in case you'd like to know, mr. bernstein, he's at the huntington memorial hospital on 180th street.
you know how to use one of those?
what kind of law?
why the hell did he do that?  what the hell did i do?
detective donald kimball?
i don't believe it. jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
oh shit.
pretty shallow of you.
how do you know all this stuff about me?
how much do you make a week? what's your salary?
ace, listen to me.
where's goebbels?  where's my little joe?
i have?
if they can't see you, what's the point?
hello you two. am i barging in on some kind of religious study group? elena, you look marvelous. will i see you and ben at the halford's?
so?
now, gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. you're not having character doubts now, are you?
mr. sayer...
why?
then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
this place is deluxe.  you got cable?
want to go for a little ride?
i love you so much, gabrielle.
i'd like a few words with you, in private.
that's because i've never been here before.
whaddaya got, nolan?
what you say?
they must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
what's the matter, jules?  trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
what kind of crap is that???
so... what happened?
but i don't want it straightened out.
take it slowly.  remember, this is a dream. anything is possible.
that's the breed...course it might take time.
philip swann?
yes.
found it.
her name's mayfield. betty mayfield.
no, alex. it's, it's --
i'm sure he's alright, bea. they'll find him somewhere.
do you want more rice?
how much?
thanks for coming to get me.
you know - i play tenor sax.
i heard he's fucked up.  they're taking him to the hospital.
dowd. eddie dowd.
i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mike's jaw. he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. mccluskey's agreed to be the turk's bodyguard.  what you have to understand is that while sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain.  never.  it would be disastrous.  all the five families would come after you sonny; the corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  so just...take that into consideration.
it's ok --
he's not like other guys.
shit!
we'll take care of it.
did you know her?
it's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  it's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  to you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
wait!
no, who?
you drive like a maniac!
right.  in my hands i have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
you think i'm dumb, don't you?
congratulations, jim. i think you've saved the earth.
the hell you say.  this isn't just about you any more.
farm boy. polish my horse's saddle. i want to see my face shining in it by morning.
maybe he'll have some advice.  maybe he'll even talk to your father.
then why don't you change jobs? 
listen, let's go downa kaplans' apartment. they told us to come down.
basically -- he asked me if i could unring a bell.
sweet jesus...! he's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
it's okay, everything's okay now.
good lord, freddie! what have you got in there?
he's lying.
how old is grandma death?
what class?
here, babe.
theo... did you?
you sound as if you hate it.
how did you find out about the toxin?
there's so many...
this is muley graves.  you remember the preacher, don't you?
except yours-yours.  the goal of world domination.  well, if you put it that way, minnie.  how can i resist?
i'm leaving.
it's the patient's request, doctor.
for the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
in english, enrique. we're in the united states--
well, it might be clair.  they're threatening not to come...
been here long?
i checked the medical database.  no one else is even close.
two thousand dollars.
aw... that's so sweet.
i don't know what happened to justin.
cameron. you remember cameron.
ben, mommies work too.  they work very hard.  mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  i just don't get paid.
oh -- you don't have to go to miser stevens while i'm around.
that depends.
christ almighty, george.  feed her a cheeseburger or something.  what does she weight, eighty pounds?
thank you.
i forgot to tell you i'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
you're back in hell now, kid. there's no butterflies here. if you want butterflies, you need to be on earth.
you're not?
report.
what's his problem?
that's a very nice offer, mr. kirby, but i'm afraid i'm much to busy. if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
someone you have to get back to?
no, i don't.  but in this case -
yes?
 what have you done about irving august?
what? do i wonder if i'd be better off if i never met my wife?
i'm a great believer in doing nothing.
were the two of you... involved?
we have to stick with the plan.
leave? the honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
grand rapids? of course.
you're not yet three months, are you?
that's it?
yeah?
you said it. three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
simple simon on the rock, go caller.
what is the matter with you? you're trembling?
no?
why did he come back?
well, if it's a discharge --
she grabbed you?  impossible.  the precogs aren't even aware of us. in the milk all they see is the future.
primary bomb is live.
kids.
yeah, that's right.
jeanne... i believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
no, no, it's not a threat, i've explained all of that.
sir! they voted me most likely to succeed!
tell us, jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir?
you have the right to remain silent. but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
the medics are looking all over for you.
and listen, i'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back.
can we make it a hundred?
no, i come to see doctor.
what do you want from my life, salvy? he's my brother.
hello.
women?  no... not really.
joe -
how the hell is that your business?
small potatoes.
coffee.
you ain't gettin' in no trouble, i hope.
in a railroad accident many years ago.
let's get him over to the bed.
you already packed up your stuff?
yeah.
i don't know.
do any other daikinis ever come by here?
they're requesting visual communications, sir.
i don't see how ... anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from ebeneezer shreck.
i'll do it.  the rest of you continue.
mama, what was we laughin' for?
awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -i've brought them.  is he here?
nazis!!
you don't have to thank me, i'm a nurse. this is my father, dr. barrington.
hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
i have no quarrel with you, brave sir knight, but i must cross this bridge.
show a little respect, nero.  the man was an important artist.
today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
mr. gekko, i don't think i can...go on.
studio b.
you know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
she's not dead!
hi.
... fine. i’ll go for the safe place.
what are you doing here? this is our territory
i don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
this is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, nick leavitt--
we are better here.
my fault?!  if you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
i ran into eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
really?
where are my children?
you don't have to work another day in your lives.
consarn the consarn --
if they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
who is who?
what's going on here?  daphne - daphne -
he teach you to do it?
or a big mother slug maybe?
oh, san diego? i've thought about moving to san diego.  it's hard to make a living in this town. these short hops.  can't make a dime on 'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can make a buck. these little hops cost me money.
it's celine.  he's okay.  he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
i don't see why you can't just lock me in.  it's not like i can go anywhere.
watch it, i'm gonna fall.  i'm gonna go!
are you hurting her?
bloom!
i've got one condition.
those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
yeah, better run, you bastards!
oh god, i hate things that start like that....
yes, sir.
uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, i thought maybe...
what is your name?
you can't die until you tell me where the c-4 is. where is it?!
i thought she built it herself.
all the guys they claim are english to and good-looking like dan day- lewis and liam neeson, turn out to be irish.  even anthony hopkins is welsh.  prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
steady, boy.  just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
then you're crazy.
through, through his book.
i've been around here six months and i still can't get over it.
reilly, you're done for now. what the hell were you thinking directing the bomb squad team into hot pursuit. they had no business-
july.

it's for the best.
no!
what if he's not?
gas.  didn't you turn it on?
yes, but we're divorced.
joe knew the whole story.  i told him.  it was his idea that i come clean.  i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what i mean?
and jim.
thanks.
the only honest thing to do is call it off. let her look for somebody else.
beth, i didn't.  hold it together. alright?
isn't that great?
you'll be sucked down too!
i own a brownstone on this block.
yes.
you mean you ain't coming with emmett and me?
actually, it's mary brooks now.
what happened?
yes. the city of the dead. where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt.
why you looking around so much?
why'd you do that?
it's no problem.  i was just with everybody we work with.
you know how to box?
that's what i want to find out. we have to get help.
that's a good girl... i hate to see you so upset.  tell me, sweetheart. are you having problems with charlie? you mentioned something this morning.
everything.
you were the snake!  right?  i know.  i saw you.
then we should...
what do you mean you're not a christian?  of course you're a christian, we're all christians...
yes.
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
you okay?
don't let it bother you so, wes.
hey, it was good for me too, sparky.
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
... where did curiosity get the cat?
well, who is your lord?
that's quite a compliment.
we got boo-coo movement. 3rd battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
this was a selective operations unit, agent levoi. there is classified information pertaining to our national security. you don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. jesus christ --
but i saw these women. i saw their mutilated bodies. i saw their ghosts. i just know it happened i can feel it...
you better not be taking on a new partner.

i wish we were investigating attila the hun.
no.
oh, yeah.  definitely.  highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  bad, bad stuff.
ricky? ricky 'i lost the truck' ricky?
i'm sorry, gentlemen. the other day i heard such a funny story...  it still makes me laugh. it is very funny.  i am sorry. oh yes... about this injunction...
on brean and moss, who walk schumann across the highway. in the b.g. we see ames talking to the driver of the harvester, who is a small, hispanic man.

i'm at nirdlinger's. let yourself in.
yeah? what do you do with 'em?
oh. i'm sorry--refresh my memory. what episode does the orgy happen in, again?
no.
no, i mean, what city, what state are you in?
i will.
he i.d.'d the assailant. the description matches you pretty well.
i'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
i hate the storm. i hate it!
morpheus.
i'm a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
so... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
i think that you do. do you know where i'm going?
a thousand dollars ... and it's on all night?
you going to eat this?
a remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! she- never-spoke-another-word.
good-bye, adam.
what are you doing?
congratulations, colonel. you have saved us all.
only african he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour nigerian model for gucci, and he got wounded when she took an nba draft choice to the super bowl instead of him...
go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
we're just here to carry your light, aren't we? just the torch-bearers.
what're you guys doing?  huh?
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center. the mcc, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  we're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
all right, look.  i can make it right, i can make this up to you, mattie.  i can, i swear.
ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  well, this looks very good.. of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
i don't think i will, rick.
oh michael, look...
can i keep it?
yes it is...we did this.  we changed everything.  i've been having bad dreams, johnny. dreams where i die...in the fire.  i was supposed to die in that warehouse.
oh, tell the story.

something bugging you?
if she can stand it, i can. play it!

it's coming -- i rode on ahead.  i have to speak with the captain of the english army... his name's talbot...
you must carry spare parts --
where are you going? to him? is that it? to be a whore to that gutter rat?
our kind of women?
if you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
what is it?
listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
well, i mean...i wanna be on tv. maybe have a talk show or something. like conan. or early letterman.
either way works for us...
watch it with meyerling.  man's as mean and corrupt as they get. cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
yeah i did, treasurer. shouldn't you be studying or something.
you don't know anything about joe --
sorry, miss.
rod's not a lunatic.

it must have slipped my mind.
i want you to fix these fish!
he don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
no.  tell them i'll do it.  but i want more posters all over rome.
when you see debi, tell her i'm sorry.
yeah?
they've abandoned me... like everyone.
smasheroo.  smasheroo.
then keep your mouth shut.
hello?
what's your name?
look. all i want is a haircut. i'm not worried about this guy.
the ten dollars.
what are you an idiot!
they made me put my hat back on.

it was a surprise, mom.
you were following him night and day. you saw who killed him. you even took pictures of it. it was evelyn mulwray. she's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
watch out for that glass.
well i don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
what were you doing there?
kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
that was really great.
there is no world without verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. then banished is death mis-termed. calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
yes, sir.
what if it's not that she's seen something?  what if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
i hate the beige one.
no.
i might find the truth rather hard to understand?... can you go back?
and steal darryl's fishin' stuff.
the guy looks dead.
yeah. i got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. all i need's a stake and a  chance --
hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. that's what he was like - a real wacko.
a tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... there's another in residence at lindfarne now.
very funny, smart ass.
stop it!
thorgan, suit up.
oh god, how horrid.
you knew the whole time, didn't you?  when you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. didn't you?!
thompson!
they've done it before. takes maybe two minutes.
it was fort sumter they fired on-
sign this, and i will confess you myself if you want.
couple of weeks... listen --
the accident...?
hi, andy.  how's the weather up there?

no.  but it buys a lot of other things.
hi. i'm bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home--
yes or no, mr. barnes?
prints?
never mind.  do they have that knowledge?
it's a promise?
oh, i know he didn't, but i wish i could find him...  i have something very important to tell him. macaulay won't help at all.  he thinks i just want money.
huh huh. this says beavis.
he is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! he'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. if this solution were raised at the u.n. by ambassador zorin, he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson.
i don't know.  but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.

there's nothing to say, tita...
what the hell kinda cop are you?!
i've got twenty hours left. i could die in here. and you're falling in love.
you came through, nicky.
you can't.  he gets you and you're dead. it's like time catching up with you, you know?  like fate.  each level you get progressively less time to complete.  first half of the game takes place in the wild lands.  then you reach level 6, and that's the sea of darkness.  there's a two-headed boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  if you don't...
valentine's day.  that's got to be a bummer. where did you get that date, elaine?
that's why i never checked it. the bag felt right.
what'd you do that for? it's an in- teresting story. all these people are still disappearing. right off the street.  hey, what's wrong? are you all right?
oooooh, i'm good.
then give me comfort. sleep with me tonight.
go tell your father we're eating.

where are you?!
christ, val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
i didn't turn her into mother. you did.
andy!  i'm heading out the door.
if that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
well ... how can i put this. there were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. because <u>i</u> had trouble reconciling them.  vicki said.
beth.
then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
mm-hm.
your line of work.  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
all vienna has heard that.
from now on. i'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
why did we begin this?
okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
i didn't come here to see a house. what about norma desmond?
please don't mess me up with bandages, mrs. brenner.
laser-envy.
something grand and beautiful, george. something i've been searching for all my life. the answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. i've found it, george, and i can't leave it. you mustn't either.

hello, my dearest darling.  so good to hear your voice again.
i've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but i couldn't convince myself to stop. this 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
no, that was me.
probably on his way back right now.
delightful, court composer. would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
i know who you are.
right.  ahm... the film's great... and i just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
i'm talking to you.  my clothes and things are up in the room.
call me jake. careful driving home, curly.
it's all your fault! it was all arranged until he spoke to you! why can't you leave us alone?

ok, nobody shoot. he could still have the unit on him. keep your distance. we don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
george, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

very well.
what's that? what's that? take it away - take it away - take it away! 
one--oh!  heh-heh.  you never went to college?

so what now?
abbott.  he knows about the embassy. he's coming down for a show and tell.
pills... you know how i feel about pills.
j.t.'s done everything he can. i married a brave man. augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so j.t. can't even get the law enforced.

we can appeal, but i can't guarantee anything.
uh-huh.

well, like i said, ann is my sister. sisters talk. you can imagine the rest.
did they try and fail?
so would i.
if they had any reason to.  why make it tough for themselves?  why go to all that trouble?  here's an open book.  close it.  no reason to keep it open.  she was a nice girl, anyway.  and perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  perhaps she didn't kill the other one. you never know.  give her the benefit of the doubt.  leave her stay where she is.  close the book. finis.
don't do this.  i am literally begging you not to do this.  chris.

i've never lied to you.  i've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but i've never lied.
i though we went over this.
what's this?
i know of no one.  but even if there is, i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
well, actually, i thought i'd run an idea by you.  you know, just to see if you're interested.

nice touch, pritchett: subtle.
i enjoy his company....
it's not a game.  something you play.

i don't want to eat it.
give it to me, sami.
yes, of course.
...i won't let a killer walk!
thanks.
you're a hell of a flyer.  you can be my wingman any time.
is that what i think it is?
i don't understand.
to be known as he!
for scaring you like i did.  when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
what the hell did you think you were doing?
she thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that i might have done something.  she said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "you touched me wrong..." "i know that." some crazy thought in her, in her head...
bye.
yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. i hope he don't mess things up.
michael, what are those men doing?
man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
thank you for your cooperation.  just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
you can't win 'em all.
this is one big house for one single person.

that kid is amazing.
we're not skipping this treatment.
no harm in your coming to see us.
sorry.  you okay?
look, the truth is, i didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. i wanted to go on with you. i needed an excuse.
i'm sorry.  it's not up to me.

what's there to think about?? that thing back there...
that's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.

mr. roston, what was your relationship with miss lawson?
c'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
...don't worry. i'm not the man that's after you.

i am very sorry, sir, i have not seen act two.
lloyd.  lloyd dobler, i've got you.

okay. now you're really starting to piss me off!
...well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
what are you talking about?
oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. no.
and did you have a close personal relationship?
you were impressed with something. it's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
you're a caterer?
where is the play?
that was extreme!  did you see that one guy--
and my permission?
yeah, but i like the sun.  i grew up on a reservation.  the sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  jake's the same way.  he loves the desert.  i guess we're alike that way.  that's about the only way.
you know i can't.
but i'm not. the newspapers're --
of course.  mister mcmurphy.
...but ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
great. now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.

we stood here once before.
i'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that i mind... i mean, i'm ok with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
so... what do you have to tell me?
you used to call me "james".
did you hear it's yours?
now, george! dinner's ready now!
yeah.
it's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
so that's the one you want to marry.
you media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
the <u>orlac</u> claim.
look who's back? want some champagne?
the napkin will keep.  i'd rather not be alone.

no... wait, there's something else, something weird. i hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. he's talking big and living bigger.
oh, please do come.  don't disappoint us. it'll be such fun.  and bring your yacht.
so, you surviving without me?
a cattle boat?
where?
the best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. no matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. and there it is again... perfect.
get that out of your trunk.
one minute to warp threshold...
i'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  you'll have the gun and i'll drive the car.
this is healing?
what're your taking down?
is it true you're going to interview dr. furtwängler today?
yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to katmandu.
i want a martini! it's new year's eve and i want a martini!
don't you get it? i don't want to leave. this is who i am.
you're gross.  see that guy?
i did.
-- stop it. he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe.
two packs a day.
strong survival instinct. admire that in a woman.
it probably has the dumper's name. it might give us some kind of new lead.  i want a look at it anyhow.
so it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
no.
recover any bodies?
honey that song came out in 1968, when i was exactly your age.
you know i liked it better long.
your pen palls dead, lady.
okay, i think i could swing that.
i don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  you should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
something happened with marty and ray--
winner six!
yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
my girlfriend.  if she still is...
so what do we do?
shall we try and go around?
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.
adam, where are you?
all of them do.  we'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  and we'll be rich.
what's the cut, poppa?
slower! in... out...
i felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
no way, jude. i'm out.
this is fun...
i'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
right over here.
did you have to use that much explosive?
there you go, talking like a woman!
and there! there you see? her key is on the rack!
doesn't everybody?
head for... for the white water.
can i pull my fucking dick out?!
gentlemen of the "enquirer"!  this has, i think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  mr. reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. it will make them happy to learn that the "enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
no one saw me but the italian and a dog. i blew up their generator. they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
i didn't mean for any of this to happen.
where?
she's well, too.
look, baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and i'm putting you in the top ten. now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
that was your mom. she wanted you to have this.
why do you need to wreck this company?
nikki! great! did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
bjorn's not. he could have bjorn's place.
grandpa samuel reaches. heavy duty medicine.

i don't know.
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort.
... about dorothy.
if that ain't fate?... hi, i'm dave caldwell.  i do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  men fight better without women around.  and that is an historical fact.
does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
oh, how'd she get back?
i know you said you didn't want any calls...
i made it outside.  i'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  help is on the way.  just sit tight.
de moraes? i was asked here by a mrs spitz.
fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of black vomit?
i heard you, dr. yueh and gurney coming down the hall.
nope.  nothing at all.
who'd you ask?
elementary? oh, i don't doubt that it was. i remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
you're crazier than i thought, lenny.  coming here... tran's just in there.
two days ago, would you have even hit me?  let alone so powerfully?
why... yes.
where?
what?...
what should i do?
back to california
yeah!
we got problems.
i'm going in. will you be my wing- man?
i can't believe you flew first class.
joe! it's 56 hours!
lieutenant, the admiral is aware of the regulations.

i was, wasn't i?  i was john fucking malkovich!  take me back, craig.
goldmouth? they say he was born out back behind the shithouse. that's what they say.
i thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
don't do that again.
we saved him! saved him before the creature could finish his work. now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
yeah.
i wish to possess what you have now.
hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
you're awake.  can you hear me?  you've been shot.  i'm trying to help you.  you were in the water.  you've been shot.  it's okay now.
hell yeah. you work here long?
you can tell by the intonation.
your life will never be the same.
well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, i admit. but she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
the four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
tell me, cindy. would you ever tell me "stop. if you loved me you'd stop."
who from work?
you're a dirty pig!
drop it.
watch it! compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and boom! careful, huh?
which ought to be about three hours more, i'd say.
this!! 
what a strange fellow.
you sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
great. i knocked off the aglet, as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we're there.
he'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
what about a bee...?
...maybe. i mean you gotta hide all the lights...
eat it?
sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  the students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  they want to explore.
what is that?
so j.d., what are you studying in school?
my truck can't be more than ten feet away. we load into the back, i can get in the front and we roll out of here.
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, bob.
it takes all types.
yeah?
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
what is going on?
you went in the apartment?
my dad sent me this diary for a reason. until we find out why, i suggest we keep it to ourselves.
i would have stayed there if i could.
huh?
what kind of band is this, anyway?
i had a lifeline. if i've got a lifeline, i'm okay.
doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.

my goodness, a word with four syllables. i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
the butler said i could stay. i told him it was important.
last time i saw him he was this strong guy.  now he's beaten. and you <u>liked him</u>.

i've been working.
i knew you'd make it!  where's your girl? didn't she come?

tear into it, will you? don't sit there like a frozen robin!
the ink on your divorce isn't dry. your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, michael francis... was in some trouble with the reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.

i love you bob. i really do. forgive me?
i dunno.

no one's asking you to!
good morning.

singing?
i'm only safe in the russian zone... i'm safe as long as they can use me...
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies.  in every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  to the lady's question about my birth and parentage, i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune, that i was going to dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
little sister, i don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. i want you to rest... for a while anyway.

well, if it's absolutely necessary...
hi.
what is this?
-- miss kreutz, please --
so what has changed?
you seem surprised. could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  you needn’t worry. it seems his motives were pure. from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
haven's not going to talk to me.
to protect his people.
in your particular case, miss, i would make some allowance...
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
business, best hidden is hidden best at night.

ray barboni. guy from miami, owns leo now that momo died.
what about the owner of the house...  ...this john diebold, any idea where he might be?
for some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. no matter. i had hoped to have the wedding next spring, lord turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. but fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
you try going through what we did. bob couldn't take it, that's all. christ, there's times when it still seems like i can't either.
how about "nickel nick's slot arcade?" "hot slots," that sounds heavy. twenty- nine cent hotdogs...

he didn't have a dinghy aboard. i'm going down to take a look at his hull.
the character that's supposed to be me, susan alexander--
last night.  you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
last night --
yeah, well i don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. otherwise it's -
this is the only place in rome where i thought -- i believed -- i was wholly in power.
what about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
i have to think about my future. and what people expect from me.
that's good: he earned it.
i'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
god, you're just like him! just keep me locked away in the dark, so i can't experience anything for myself
it happens to be a beautiful love story.  ya know, you used to like that about me.  you used to say you liked that i didn't make you think so much.  that we could be together and not think...
here's the dealio on eyes only.  he's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  so he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- i gotta go.
the village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost sankara stones...

just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
you need a glass?
you have a record of what happened in the operating room...
what's the lighthouse?
did you see her?! she just said "fuck you" to me!
no "900" numbers.
but you can't ignore these facts!  it's suicide!  worse than that, it's genocide.
case... it's four a.m.
which mountains are those dear?
it depends.
be friends?
oh, walter.  i don't deserve you.

i'm so sorry.
i'd never try to sell an indian.

it's okay.
she's not at that place you sent her?
and you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
and?
i'm sorry but there's no record of a jacob singer in our files.
well no -- not exactly -- but --
do you want to sit there, jeff?
see that sheathing on the suspension? eaten away.  same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  the algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
did you ever go back to see her?
first i couldn't feel it, but now i feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.

patrick, we're in the middle of --
let's see if you can follow me around this room.  the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase - bowtie, 12 o'clock. the other imf team.  you're worried about me. <u>why</u>?
there's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
did i hear a yes?
but this woman -- and her son --
come here. feel this.
because, if the british got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  and the revolution would be finished.  tell king louis, it's that bad.
no money in his room there?
my place, can't you see?
until two days ago all i really knew about charles was his name -- now it turns out i didn't even know that.
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude.  you saved my life.
this witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a new york police captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named virgil sollozzo.  do you deny this?
what's with you? what do you care whether i come or not?
feelin' good's good enough.
okay, phyllis, what's up?
well we do.  he's chummin' around with a big c named henry gondorff. ring any bells?
clear the area. this is an order!
he doesn't like to say much does he?
the castle anthrax?
what are you doing, travis?
hey.
same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your valentine's card.
what is wrong with us?... we have everything.
but we had it!  we were headed right for it!

there's nothing much to laugh at.
do you wish to advise starfleet, sir?
you never said anything to me...

sure. but you want the truth? you're even suspicious of him.
she has no real grip on reality.
here you are.
"i know not."
oh -- i was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. we were drilled like little soldiers -- we danced in the school of the imperial ballet, in st. petersburg. i was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- no rest, no stopping. and then -- i became famous and whoever is famous is alone... but why should i be telling you this? last night i did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- i do not even know your name.
gabriela! -- you did get away.
i haven't any hard feelings.
you must think i'm some kind of fool.
i don't know.

i have a surprise for you.
that's fantastic.
yeah, like what?  quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  lottery tickets?  a travel iron?
you like that vaughan?
why did you take the back roads here?  they're not safe.  you'd know that if you'd planned.
i’m an american and in america, people sue. so to prevent a lawsuit, i baked a tart. and i don’t bake.
but i don't have a conscience.  i'm a bloody thief.
more like a mystery... which isn't bad. it's just kinduv...mysterious...
gee..twenty five dollars for something i made!
oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as i recall it was admiral kenney, the surgeon general of the navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
nothing? then it must be very boring for you here.
miriam called, looking for you. she said you might come, so i...
it's only grief makes her like she is.
often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. and, who in this town is owed a great many debts?

i still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
of course i can, but can't it wait? these things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
