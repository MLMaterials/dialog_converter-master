the future is ours so let's plan it.
let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
hey, it was good for me too, sparky.
who's your boyfriend?
what?
what, just the three of us?
you hate your father.
sorry, the blue thunder's out of commission for a while.
you were gone a long time.
stacy! i've got water in my ears. do you have any q-tips?
i am not third world ugly.  women like me, they think i'm cute.  like snoopy.
put those things in the car and i'll get your tie and studs together.
did you burn another kettle? y'know you're a fire hazard? this is the third one!
i'll just shoot him once.
i hope he doesn't have rabies.
are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
barnett.  was that his name? leonard barnett.  he came to the front straight from harrow.  and he looked up to me.  unlike the others, he didn't care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters.  how strange, to be admired so blindly.  i suppose he loved me.  but chastely, like a schoolboy.
then where's the lantern?  and where's the knife?
and if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
we're growing very concerned back here. there's no use pretending otherwise. we're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' people are beginning to ask difficult questions.
how's the print coming?
what do you think?  of course yes!  what's involved?
do i actually *see* this--?
... i'm sure you do ...
turn her over to a stalker.
you have to be nicer to me, dad.
who's phone?
let's make a deal.  <u>other</u> than my blood, what can i off--
don't even ask about your money. your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
what's that?
i'm not going, janet.
what?
that was a footprint. i was standing inside a footprint.
he's begging for a meeting, chief.  he wants to go overseas for awhile.
jessie, jessie, copy?
you got the will in there, don't ya?
oh, dear. i don't know what i'd do if a whole swarm kept -- oh! oh! oh, there's one on me!
great, yes, i'd like that.
come on, we can be like eichmann. he studied torah. he hated jews.
but you have problems?
we gave so much to get here. i don't know. sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for?
hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the commander.' you've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
i heard you talking. you got fired this morning, didn't you?
i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.
i dunno about this...  what will my mother think?
you know what he did when i called him?  he laughed.  he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  said it was a good lesson for me.  not to try to fill his shoes.
only if he finds out... it's a short hop to the caribbean.  we could take a few days....
there's a man here to see you, sweetheart.
y'see, <u>this</u> is what producing is:  you put me in a <u>room</u>...
charles, i tell you there is no war! there's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
and i'm perk. short for percy, i'm afraid.
what makes her think that?
how's the detective business?
you're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
so can we. so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. and we're shippin' 'em to nystrom asylum for the criminally insane.
do you even know who terry valentine is?
no one's traveling in this weather.
you're sure it's cyclops?
i am?
no need.  she does all her own stunts.
that's cool... hey look, you're carl's brother, right?
i'm sorry, major kong.  i guess i was way out of line.
he commands it whether he exists or not...  look, we can fight him and be crushed. or we can submit.
hi, i'm erin brockovich.  i was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- i guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
we're working as hard as we can --
none of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
oh yeah? what kind of stuff?
holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
no, i mean, what city, what state are you in?
it was a job. so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
she gets off in an hour, so i think i'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
but he's never there.
hurry?  what for?  i'm just now --
there was just...some tension.  you were upset.  i remember being concerned.
tough shit, bro. this ain't miami. you want something, talk to me.
a man would be more considerate. he wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
who isn't?
right.
...you sure, eddie?
okay.
a monster. i know, i know.
sandy... what's up?
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
the most respected ...
it's pretty exciting.
not me.
and if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
but if the jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
it's okay.
look --
answer the question!
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
the truth.
you let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. we'll start with him.
what?!
it wasn't deep enough. i told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
ha! you wily oriental! the phone was "mr. watson, come in here, i need you." "what hath god wrought" was the telegraph.
do you have to die to see god?
jacques...?
ready, captain.
what can i do for you?
cross my heart and hope to die.
oh, god...
what about easier to hit in an air raid?
because it is my duty.
voodoo stick?  it's nothing like that will.  you're just being cynical.
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
still and all.  carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
it will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
why?
and we know which lebowski you are, lebowski.
what do you want?  "take my wife, please"??
it tastes bad.
he's a fucking martian?!
are you?
which language?
guy, you have a last name. we just don't know it.
-- so yesterday afternoon i take sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
hold station.
as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. no one in guilder knows what we've done. and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast. out of curiosity, why do you ask?
mason.  mason?
finish what you started.  you haven't changed, chuck.  it's still you.
oh, yes. yes, of course dr. von holler. very interesting.
time for lunch i think. i'll get the sandwiches. what would you like holly?
wyatt!  my god...
my mom.  would be the problem.
...then we saw this.
dead!
listen, i got tickets for the oilers and the rams next week in the astrodome. ever sat on the fifty yard line?
come on jennie. you look sad. just take it.
well, do something, then, damnit!
--there's thousands of 'em!
i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
you were there to help dr. marx deliver her baby.  were you not?
what do i do with it?  nothing.  it's for peace of mind.  it's for the principle.
have you partied with him?
how can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
poor ike.
i know who we're going to get i the great american biography! a journey into the soul of the beast.
yes, madame?
who're you calling?
you call what you did bad?!  you knocked her up and then left her!
chief?  mike said a young girl answered the door.
i'm so sorry, i didn't notice much.
yes, jon.  that karl.
lugosi?
oh well he must be a surfer.
for shelly, taking the money was a way to take from caesar.  he could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
i feel a scene coming on.
tell me it's not true.
i want to look around, daddy-- may i?
i guess there's probably a story behind that.
not really...  maybe a couple of peacemakers...  i imagine you could overlook those, eh, bill? if you didn't see them... or hear them?
flashlights. luminous dials for watches. house numbers that light up.
right.
did romeo have a name?
where you been, man?  we got a celebrity!
you okay?
warden, it's not him. it was not fred madison in that cell.
what is it, alfredo? right now, of all times!
what'd the messican mean, a sick horse's gonna get us?  didn't make no sense.
you should've brought a leash, mr. barker. the doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
what happened?  what happened?
carnes? wait.
you really like that bitch don't you? i gotta tell you, i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. you know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. but, if you're into her... that's cool.
we have a couple. one's hers, one's mine. everybody uses a different name.  modern marriage.  how's liane?
i'm going into them, i'm going to hit them. doolittle...
there probably is.
tell me the words.
i only got about three bucks on me now, but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue. why don't we walk back to my house? i'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
she wasn't part of the deal, cox.
shit!
how much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
you want some breakfast meat. micheal. is that what you want?
i'd feel like staying up all night! forever! or at least till i got the lay of the land, so to speak.
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
welcome, master grayson. i'm alfred.
not if my tron program was running. that would seal the system off. if your file's in there...
i don't want to go to europe.
you'd think they could at least send a ship. bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this klingon flea trap...
sorry.
well... why don't you move back?
burn them.
now why does she have to be naked? how does that serve the plot?
what'd he say?
ikset-kiba.  me imanetaba oum dalat!
that is all. tell me about the mig some other time...
i was up here twice before. once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone. the last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
it's my fault. he's dead because... i left those drugs...
of course. of course. of course he does. of course. thank you. thanks.
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  voila.
you see?  the tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  it's the essence of chaos.
spunky?
oh, no. it's my own idea. i'm in the business. in the fur business.
yo, johnson...
hi, peter.
nothin', honey.  mama's just actin' strange.
well, well... jack sparrow, isn't it?
sorry about your window.
it has been three weeks since i "fired" her. is there no way to get rid of this girl? are we stuck with her for life?
got cash.
the leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
bala has always been a hopeless romantic, general.
holy smoke! a half a heelot!
you're not okay.
dad -- eleven o'clock!!
"liebestraum."
like what?
i love this.  we're onto something really big.  i can smell it, ray.  we're going to make some headlines with this one.
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can.
what was that?
a phillips head. from the toolbox.
no! that's not terrance or phillip!
the boat blew.  there was a leak in the gas line.  there were two previous repairs.  there was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  a real heavy investigation.  zilch. goose-egg.  it was an accident.
loan shark -- hey?
it's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
why do you want to stay around here? it'll only make you feel badly.
it wasn't so important to me. i mean, he never asked me why i was a hooker, and that was impressive. i really liked him. so i decided to just play my part. i mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. i suddenly came to a decision.
not necessary, but preferable. i don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
thanks for your help, peck.
never, oh! never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die.
what about me?
just coffee.  and you, sir?
what the fuck is this guy doing?
if i knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. which they probably are right now. 'bye.
think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
hey, you can't...
you're rude. i mean, you're very rude.
it's all the stuff i get to do. oh my god, oh my god... okay, okay... we get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- eeeh! okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- no way. oh... my... god!
how was that?
off what?  twenty seconds...
you just had some lucky shots.
kate mcconnell. sweet, shy... well- dressed. i'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
don't cry. 
anna, i'm faith.  you don't know how happy i am to meet you.  you see, i'm trying to find someone, and--
hell, i could tell you some stories–
what's your story, pete?
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
we're almost there.
do you have a good map of death valley?
what?  no menthol?
there are plenty of motels in this area. you should have... i mean, just to be safe...
no --
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
shouldn't we have invited tom over?
perhaps i should come back when you’re...
what reaction?
you're not a liar.  or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
monstro! ran into walter winchell outside he wants to play herod in the picture. hiya, george.
how was the game, honey?
why don't y'all check out the rest?  i'm going downstairs and see if i can get the furnace fired up.  warm this place up, you'll see.  it has serious potential.
everything okay?
about half, actually. rose, you miss nothing, do you? in fact, i put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  but it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. so i was over-ruled.
it's not another one. it's my sister.  aren't you happy for her?
are you okay?
you got two seconds!
oh, rocky -- you worked so hard.
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... i don't think cochrane built this thing for comfort.
what do you suggest?
you are a fine figure of a man.
it's a good thing my family loves you.
i should butcher all and every one of them. merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
how come?
no seriously.  i mean, they're just breasts.  every second person in the world has got them...
hullo, bob. boys, this here is english bob.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
shouldn't you be in mourning?
everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
another thing i can't stand is ...when white house reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "white house" sources say...
can i be of service, miss price?
i know you think my job is strange.  you don't like old people, do you?
oklahoma city, oklahoma.
i don't do that kind of thing.
how ya doin' dad?
scout's honor.
lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
compensation for my brother-in-law's car. indy, your father and brody --
shoot him.
spock, i'm really tired...
softball.
can you get it?
you will.  i'll see to it.
was he really upset when you told him?
somebody could've -- i was sort of passed out.
i seen a man die. he couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
it was jessica. that girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
there's an e in money. if that's your word.
many times.
you fainted last night after supper. the master and i carried you here.
they're the worst. college girls are one step from the streets. they smoke like men inna saloon. my son joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. one step from the streets, i tell you. mrs. pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
i have to go to the bank before it closes.
i'm from all over.
it's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
you've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
a real space cadet. i wonder if she'll narc on us...
is that for me?
if you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
oh man. you gotta let me do these guys. i'm such a moron. i gotta make up for the tit thing.
not at all.
it's too dangerous.
see you around.
but why do you want a divorce?
well, i live downtown.
oh, it's just so romantic.  i just want to put on a long gown...
is that really your chair?
i don't recall asking your permission.
you'd slow us down and put margo in danger.
hi, it's me...
help me!  please!!!
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west. how was he supposed to say no to that?
safe and sound, thanks to you. what the fuck was that?
you're naked.
i beg your pardon?
he's just exhausted.
it's impossible.
yeah. but not any more.
how much is it?
sure--i have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. no doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
what is that?
it was at least as good as the sky.
you're lucky.
hey!
oh, and your line to charles atlas in there: "i'll take that gun", "you'll have to".
would you like something to drink?
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
daisy. how did you know?
you catch dylan?
yeah...  come on, have a little training.
pop, can i have the car? i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
hey, are you okay?
kill them both.
you stop right there. you are a good person. good things happen to good people.
"…all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay, and follow thee my lord throughout the world."
why'd you have to say fifty? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
i don't want her to go, lillian.
what?
anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  she's the expert.  i need help.
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  when he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and i want it to bleed for me.
i breached protocol. i broke contact with the s.a.c. i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
i'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
martin, uh, we've found it.
okay.  but is this about the posters?
the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east.
and only two probabilities:  one: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
you're doing everything yourself?
yeah, we were just standing there. you said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
monday.
pg& -- are you sure?
right.  we have the same blood type...
i really want that watch.
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  or it may not.
how many wings have they got between them?
she knows it's my case?
well... i don't know if i have or not.
how's astronaut training?
you rest now.
harry, that's not nice. i'm in church now.
you had me worried to death!
yeah, see, i'm kind of a night person, so i was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
charlie, i had a strange experience.  i went back to high school. and i spent a lot of time with you.  and you and walter and leon were singing "i wonder why".
hi, mom.
let me guess:  another short circuit?
but the island!
no.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
whose son am i?
you'll be safe here.  i won't be long.  help yourself to anything you want. the galley's through there.  you can make coffee if you like.
a fighter, huh?
where do you feel like going?
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now. that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
no...
whose word?
i do believe you...
look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
yeah i guess...sort of.
is that what you want to do?
what's up, ray?
it's tommy's. the sucker owed me a favor.
yes -- cocaine.
the show must … you know
where's christine?  the waitress.
fuck you.  make time.  cause i bust my ass for you.  i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  and what do you do for me?  huh?  you see the way i'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i'm doing?  have you ever bothered saying, hey, erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best god damn employee i've ever had?
here's how they're organized. groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for.  and they all score high on the insomnia charts.
what do you think?
two?  that's it?
no.
of course it makes me mad. it makes me more than mad. just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. but what's it gonna do for me to find them now? i can't fix everything in three days.
maybe you should see a doctor.
it makes me fear her.
found him. kent island nailed the call five minutes ago. he's stationary.
scratched --  we did not take the initiative.
i'm - afraid i have some bad news for you, reef -  you'll have to share quarters, this trip.
back the tape up. i need it again! let it roll! just as high as the fucker can go! and when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, i want you to throw that fucking radio into the tub with me!
same here. but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. you know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
just cut his hair, you know.
enough talking!  we been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  my throat's fucking raw!
right.  thanks a lot.  and congratulations.  it's not easy finding love these days.
sounds good...
you know where they picked me up! twelfth street!  i wasn't even near there!
we'll talk when we get back to seattle.
there's good news and bad news.
we have a lot of work to do.
book five, deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "but this shall you deal with them.  you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
i do.
last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
that's not always a healthy way to be...
what?
i'm stopping by later. i'm worried about you. bye.
i know the cruelty of such a fate.
why?
is there another way to see it?
the police break up our meeting. herr rick! we escaped in the last moment.
let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
fletcher?  what are you doing out there?
get out?! what does it say?
it's not to wear around, or any- thing, i'm <u>way</u> too young.  it's just for play.
confirm with trig and image.
but it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.

i'm always working.
i'm warning you.  you don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
i asked for the man in charge...
no, bruce, dear. don't you see? this is a trick to get your sympathy. no, walter, i've been waiting for something like this -- but i wasn't sure when you'd spring it. if you want to save earl williams' life, you can interview him yourself. you're still a good reporter. bruce and i will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford.

cupid stupid! that's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom. call that fresh? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. you should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
you wanna go home?
i put everything in my room.  my teddy bear is joining us.
right.  why not?
please call me leonard. my wife called me lenny.
you're walker, right?
i'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
you're fuckin' a we can do this.
you don't have to do nothing.
alright, we know who we're looking for.  play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
oh, at least, sir.  the land alone is worth a small fortune.
give'em another pill...
right.  so why is he dying?  he doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
then why, beth?  why go in?  why put out explosives?  why manifest the snakes?
that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen. why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?
why? how...
it's so very cold...
they said you're the one.
i thought i'd stay the night.
slam it?
you're not from around here, are you?  where you from?
ah, c'mon!  nobody does all that.
you've got a point there.
so...?
honest, lula. i prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
what point is that?
and don't pass on the right.
open the damn safe!
bastard...
mary! mary!
ma'am?
how's egghead?
gone?... where?
yes?
his word? are you telling me haven promised you something?
wouldn't bet against her.  tell you what i will do--bet you i find that bracelet before we hit france.  not a hundred, though--just fifty.
i do not understand the final question...
dammit you’re persistent.  i don’t want to listen to this anymore.  no more bets with you.
i know about bracketing.  i read about it.  the next one is going to land right on us.
not that big.
swim where?  out there?  oh, no, forget it, not me!  you go, i'm staying.
if we beat the record, you might get a call back --
i'll let you in on a little secret, roy. in two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. it's the perfect time to switch teams... so what do you say?
... i was right about what?
and since we're talking, my wife and i don't want you hanging around our daughter.
they're from l.a. they wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
yes, mister harding?
is this finished yet?
yeah, i'm doing fine.  i have so much to tell you.  i don't even know where to begin.
i'm not cold.
how can you say a thing like that about an officer in the united states army?
oh. thank you.
it isn't working any more, david.
colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  say george, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
no one's forcing her.
... and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. he showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and i... well, i didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
why?
frank.  hey, man.  you alright?
whose?
what? i can feel you looking at me.
i guess i did.
well, i just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. i promise...
-auditorium nostrum-
and you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
senor colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
well, what are they?
whose funeral? we're doing all right. there hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
that gun.  that... that's not automatic.  the guard had an automatic...
will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
tell me the truth, carter.  do you think i have a good voice?
all the more reason i should be here.
ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
this is serious!  i don't have my license.  he was my ride.
so, what did you do?
right.  yes.  of course.
whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  if they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
shouldn't we wait for the others?
coming up!
i guess we open it.
just give me a hand.
yeah. my parents got divorced. my mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  he has... emotional problems.
you don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
the seven ceos of big tobacco... referred to this... said they should be afraid of him... i assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  now, you tell me. what does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
al?
jesus!
hold on.
it's okay, it's okay.
i've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
doing what?  mowing your fucking lawn?
look what they put her on...
i'll tell you what...
she does at that.  i knew when i married her she was a free spirit.  a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect?  but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. so, i married her.  what are you to do, eh? women.
apparently he has the letters.
a long, long, long...
we lost cousins, friends.  we will wash this in blood.
certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, i don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
we were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
for one thing, you like expensive things.
no need to apologize.
hey, where you going?
we'll see when we get home okay.
i reckon i feel all right.
i think she would cheer.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
merlin! out of the sick sleep at last.
how would you know?
do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
why don't you go lie down?
what does this have to do with..?
they oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  if i'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to ramelle, i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
where? at the city hall? no! i want the whole wedding or we will have bad luck. for a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
he's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
how do you do, mr. matuschka?
you look good--
two days.
you're so wrong.
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet...
that's not what happened to your parents.
hey, did you hear what he said?!
you disrespect our tradition.
hello, jane. it’s me.
actually, there's someone i want to meet ...
let's follow 'em.
taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
eh, forget it.  what else is big?  teenagers!  jailbait pics!  yeah... you got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
eat something, would you?
where were you last night?  i didn't hear you come in.
yes?
say, aren't you that actor guy?
-- you split the team, man. and what was that crap with the standpipe? you'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
anything.
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  i was up for going to bixby.  i was getting excited.
and so i get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? is that for real?
what makes you think he hates you, judy?
well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
ahh! jesus! you're burning hot! what the hell -
don't point at me.
lori says he can't remember jack shit!
... oh... god...
clockworks?
calm down...give the gun to me. you're out of control, son.
the turkey in?
how was the meeting?
it's yours?
i'm not kidding.  you can get one if you have the credit.  look just like real cows, too.
what thing?
however they are, that's the deal. a buck a throw.  five thousand dollars.  split it half and half.
relax!
why do you keep lying to me?					 *
you can't make me do a thing.
you're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
i didn't say that.  i never said--
top secret. only on a need to know.
you tell that to them!
and then shut down the pipe lines.
get out of there!!! get out!!! put your hands up, on your head. go on!!! get down on your knees - do it!! what are you doing? who are you? what's your name? what's your name?
louis gara's dead. l.a.p.d. found him dead in a car on ninth. and we've lost ordell.
i'm sorry. but if the shoe fits.
m'hm.
somebody named leo crow.
that's a shame, john.  a real shame.
what do you want?
quinn will be here any minute.  what are you going to say?
what kind of a dog is he?
but that's cause he don't know!
to do my work well, i have little time for --
you told them. you said i arrived on a camel, shot you four times. left you for dead.
can't do it.  now go back and get help!
it's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  the world's about to end.  i feel like i could save it.
he didn't suffer.
julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. there's no way off this place.
against...who could be aggressor....help me out here...units of 303, the defense department confirms, early this morning, albanian time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy william schumann, suffering no casualties.  his condition is reported as guarded, and his route to the us has not been disclosed, but a high white house source confirms he is expected in washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  moss's working on big bird's inaugural.  nine a.m...?  nine?  miss the commuters, but...
well i don't want to seem desperate or anything.
a year and a half later? you're still brooding?
you mean you don't want to go to a movie?  there's plenty of movies around here.
but sir, i'm not condem ...
when may i expect the cleaners?
what do <u>you</u> call it?  ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  i should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
looks like ya gonna take office just in time, chief.  things need straightening up in this city.
i did.
it killed her.  it ate her.
this is him.
he's not fine.
i almost had 'im.
you think it'll send this guy back to hell?
going somewhere?
oh, actually it was.  then why'd you call it off?
cute, dejesus...specimen cups?
call me!
a mass of music and fire. that's me. an old kazoo and some sparkles. tell me - was bill swept away, too, or were you too full of revelation to notice?
no talking please. i'm going to ask you some questions. please answer all questions truthfully. we'll know if you don't. birthplace ?
i'll go.
what happened in there... that won't your fault. ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
i'll have to find some more.
everywhere i go, they point and whisper! at the opera, they hiss at me when i take my box. when i went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said i was already damned! why must i suffer for your sins?
what's debbie's blue book value right now?
i just might give you a ring when we get back to london.  there's one or two things i'd like to... will you let me have your number before you leave?  have you ever watched a commercial being made?
white house boys want a private meeting.
he's going after debbie, i gotta stop him.
eat a carrot.
i've lost him -- where is he?
that casy. he might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. he was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
you sure about this?
look.  we're talking about life and death here.  i don't know why we're even having this conversation.
besides, what does he know about negroes?
wuddya do?  carl looks around.
you're with us in battle.
why isn't she with you?
how come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
my god,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... what time is it?
oh... i did so look forward to seeing all those people.
but what reason could he have? what possible reason?
i was your choice, dr. lecter. you chose to speak to me. would you prefer someone else now? or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
water. worth killing for out here, i'd think.
if you only mean to dupe me again --
government.
i wanna know first: to what do i owe this honor? i mean, i never even heard of this guy.
now you're talking!
he is my secretary! i hope that answers all your questions, m'sieu giron.
what do you want?
not a word.  but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  you work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
have you told someone?
i'll call you up tomorrow morning. maybe, we'll go see a movie.
a dressing bag?
you still gonna play for brazil ?
yes?
they're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  no more drills.  we stand at full ready starting--
...i gotta tell you, fink. it won't wash.
i can't let this happen. i want you to go out the back. i'll make up some excuse.
i'm not being grouchy.  i just want to finish my work.
how long has she been dead?
still playing?
because they are here.  because tsavo is the worst place in the world.  come, john- to the bridge. 
they serve dinner on the flight?
'really a lot appreciate it...'
use the fucking bomb!
what's in it?
what was that?
listen to you, "directly". you're not gonna get <u>near</u> the news department. and if you did, it'd never get on the air. time-life buried the zapruder film for 15 years.
you're lawyers.  how can you let this shit go by!  look!  this?  nixon can't say this.
the ship is sailing wihout us!
keep going over these. i don't want anybody getting lost.
hang up the phone.
but if you wanna talk about bad luck...
yes.
wonderful!
yes, sir.
no news from manchester yet -- do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
i'm sorry.  would you please rephrase the question.
... tell me about this case.
well, that's just how stupid i am. when you go riding, it will be with me. and if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
mom's such a cutie.
a car's got to come along sooner or later.  when it does, we jack it.
i know the owner of campton place.  i could talk to him in the morning.
a little more was taken out before.  my brother's a director of that bank, mr. mccoy... i had a few pressing debts.
that's the truth...
is it the truth?
anna... maybe it would be better to wait a while.
yeah, saw eddie, yeah.  me and him are muckers.
oh, he does!
i'm not taking drugs, dad.  can i go to bed now?
but i understand what you don't like about me. i do. what i am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
...that's right.
yes sir.
ha!
the big hammer?
you must eat lunch pretty early. it's only eleven o'clock.
why?
lieutenant quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
workin'. pickin' peaches. but i seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so i come out to see what's goin' on. what's it all about?
shit.
we are now accused of aiding the rebels. the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
they gave me the exact same thing as last year!
c'mon, it all worked out. you came out okay in the end...
i noticed.
my, my, what a coil we're in! what's this all about?
how far did you go?  was it cold?
know what?
what's bothering you, huh?
fine. i'll put it on my room. okay?
you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.
i don't want that to happen.  why would i want that to happen?
so you just want to use me and go?
deck four, captain; officers' quarters...!
she got off, huh?
--brother of rustin parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
it's not because of georgina -- because of dr. macfarlane's failure?
hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and i do mean no one.
but corrado...  if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
i'm sorry about this, mrs. gould.  i really am.
you like to sit down?
two or three nights.
how's business, dave?
you're scared to cancel on daly.
in case you’ve forgotten.  i’m dead already.
can you tell me whose...
pray?
she's a dab hand with a racquet, your friend.
oh, lydia!
i'm working on it.
don't get mad, louise, but where are we going?
no. it's all right.
i don't like to talk about it.
don't forget, mrs. higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about kevin. you need to do something about this.
yuck.
yeah, it's not bad. usually ann has some serious salt action going. i keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
what do you think?
go on, hit me.
well, i --
i know em, i don't know what order they come in...
what do you mean?
i'm ready to do it.  and i'm going to be here more than two weeks.
you've been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
he offended me with his terrible taste.
thank you.
rick march.  who the hell are you?
of course, finch.  what?
alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
they don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  it's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
if the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
it may be important to you, m'sieu giron--
when you've lost as many years as i have, love, puts things in perspective, know what i mean.
.... i'm afraid there's not much left.
just ask me what you want to know.
... where did curiosity get the cat?
there you are!  my god, darling, i've been so worried.  are you alright?
get in bed. y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? you're turning into a yuppie frankenstein, you love money so much.
halloween.
what are you doing here? you're supposed to be in palermo.
maybe i'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
well, what do you know ! joe gillis !
oh, so now i was drunk!
physician, heal thyself.
yeah. great, isn't it?
nothing yet.
she could be under sedatives, sleeping.  he's in the room now.
special agent scully --
it sounded like a pick-up line.
he won't go into the interrogation room.
anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  and amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. she missed you.
there are no...headquarters. there are no...rebels. only the walking dead. don't you see. they have won.
okay.  good.  goodbye.
you version of it.
so my little brother's staying here. i'm sleeping with rita.
was he in love?
a better friend.
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had.
give me the keys!
well, you don't look any the worse for wear, mr. gittes, i must say... where's the girl?...
do something.
let me know.
wait for what? until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
let me speak to clarence.
now don't get carried away-
that feller's a whole sight meaner than me. he'd just whup the tar out of me.
you set your patients on fire!
mmmmm!
i hope you feel better, sweetie.
are you supposed to be in iowa?
you may be right.
birds speak to me all the time. what did it say?
lose something?
i mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
whiskey.
you don't have to be that honest, burt.
pretty good. sticking with hot water.
she's right.  if you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
dumb magic.  giant smash peewee.
promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
he's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
wow! look at all these creeps!
adjust parallel course, navigator. bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
no.
look, clarence, i'm not joe cocaine.
yah.
once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa. well, one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
why?
want me to breathe deeply?
how much do you remember?
he's the liaison for mccay. listen go. go now.
it's peter, egon.  i've got a problem.
don't you think this is a bit premature? we don't have the backing yet to...
why? here is the music. it's here. i am submitting it humbly. isn't that what you wanted?
art mo-o-o-ney!
probably in the bible.
i was so... i been so... and then i saw you on tv, and i remembered, ya know... i always liked you...
come on, bobby. time to go to bed.
what do we do with him?
i promise.  i won't.
tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, i'm threatening to blow the whistle.
rennie...??
for her?
that's confidential.  could you put the money on the dresser?
twelve months in oak.
are you looking for gabriela rossmann?
the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  his father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. and that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
don't want to be critical, john, but here it is—
this is pretty good. considering...
yeah, yeah.  i just want to see 'em.
monsieur blaine, i wonder if i could talk to you?
you don't have to—why, we're with you, mr. doe. we just lost our heads and acted like a mob. why, we . . .
yes.  i said, "not actually." the fuck you care, george?  we're just talking...
ah, i'd sell that. start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
except this time, the mission is a man.
he's really very short on charm.
we're not as bad as you think, rob.
thanks.
told you to stay away from this hell hole!  why did you disobey me?
oh, yes. will you help me fold these, please?
well, now, maybe you won't have to.
yeh, sleepin'.
no, he's the dad.
but, they were there i counted 803 votes.
holy shit cartman!  what was that?!
he's marvelous!
what if the radio stops working?  christ, what if i can't reach you again?
more'n likely.
so, where'd you go today.
how do you know what she doesn't like?
a man would look anywhere for her, mary. there is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
what're you doing here...?
this can't be happening?
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. people say it has something to do with the ozone layer. what do you think?
promise me.
mostly what.
pictures?
and danny zorn, what was that?
where is that?
not to my knowledge. privacy is a great concern to my customers. but, if you say this is an fbi matter...
i found dickie's rings.
guess that'd be me. again.
let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  come on, i'll show you thunder.
<u>i'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
goddamn, didn't you hear him!  he practically pulled the goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
i don't see how you could know about these things unless elliot's been talking to you.
are you telling me no?
they ain't sendin' nicky nowhere.
you say you've come here on your own account?  no one knows you are here?
i'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  lost.  alone.  like her life is over.
and you believe that ?
i can't say.
mr. wood?!
he's shut out the communication circuit!
you is something, homeboy. my trouble is -- i ain't had enough stuff yet, i ain't et all the ribs i want and i sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
i don't get it.
i need a minute here, okay?  you're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
i don't know.
i'm going to miss you.
them straw polls is ugly.
i got to get downstairs.  the c.i.a., they want to see your body.
it's incredibly simple.
why not?
what good does that do?
we all had to write a last letter home.
here's the plan...we don't <u>even</u> stop.  ride like hell.  tonight we keep right on going.  we'll walk the horses.
now. but first, he worked for you.
can anyone else see him?
forget about it, nick. don't let it bother you.
no, <i>this</i> is your man.
i am with you, my love. like no other can ever be.
but it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, it's a goya reproduction. those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in western art.
it's always the women that start the trouble.
you know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved mrs. halpern and katie.
no -- nothing.
i can't fuckin' do this.
i don't like it....
explain that.
then why did you quit?
what the hell are you doing?!!
when danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled yes, brave sir robin turned about and gallantly he chickened out bravely taking to his feet he beat a very brave retreat bravest of the brave sir robin petrified of being dead soiled his pants then brave sir robin turned away and fled.
the albacore club.
aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  he knew he was holdin' ya back.
with a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make sitka in five days without another stop.
i'm still okay.
why?
when'd you get here?
you mentioned a guy from l.a.p.d., but you didn't mention the federal.
kansas!
i know, mother.
you've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
okay, fine, you're full a shit, i'm full a shit.
i'm not. she just left.
nineteen, sir.

look at this.
so, what do you think?
we've stuck it out for a whole week now... pretty girl.
hold the line here. do not shoot! the colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. paul approaches oliver

um... seventy... something.
it's stupid... it's so fucking stupid!
yes, we'd like to get moving.
nellie gail ranch...
oh, lord....
yeah. i guess--sometimes--senator paine must be right. sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  and if you say so too, saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
you have a name, missy?
i say, to most people it's a washout.
very becoming. it looks better on you than it did on me.
answer him dick!
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
do you love him, loretta?
kara and danny never showed up tonight. we'd better go home and check on them. there's nothing else for us to do here.
ok. man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. he is entering a white van. what time is it?
look who's talking.
oww!
you've nothing to fear, kringelein
it must be twelve-thirty.
don't sweat it. well. 'night, jeff.
then we'll be safe?
that your spider in there? in that bottle?
why?
more light, chief?
todd, there's a picture of whitman over the door.  what does he remind you of? quickly, anderson, don't think about it.
cora peterson, his technical assistant. you'll join duval and the others --
and how do you feel when you are lied to?
it's true... but a first contract, it's an exception.
ain't nothin' free in this world. everybody says it, and it's true.  i wanted you all to have a good trip.
whattaya mean, why?  'cause you can't!
jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
hell, you know, coca-cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. i guess that's how come they stay number one.
at least our obituaries will be accurate.  that's reassuring.
listen... how much money did you make this year?
woody, what are you doing under the bed?
isn't it true that without esparza, you had no investigation?
hey, ain't i seen you on the tour?
you know chastity?
killed outright?
yeah.  i-i don't know what's wrong with him.  he's just...kind of distant and difficult.
i mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
got it!
what's wrong with it?
just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
that bad?
jeezus!
yeah.
hi. it's maya. please leave a message.
call it a test of soldiery, then. the english won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
emma in wonderland. welcome, mrs. peel.  we've been expecting you. we hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. decontamination is almost complete.
naturally you have copies.
where's it headed?
i needed this, y'know? i really needed this. just when i'm nearing the fruition of my project, big bird flies into town.  go ahead! kill me by inches! put me on the agony rack!
all right...
what time is it?
so...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
don't do that!
let go of me!
which is ridiculous. boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
where do you think you're going?
maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
maybe.
you're alyssa's sister? heather?
you think too much?
he's a regular humanitarian. and all this time i thought he was just a tool.
i look at it as how many i've saved. that's the way you've got to look at it.
grace, i need you to come with me.
in sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
i've heard it said that way.
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish. a willing, billing, lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish.
somebody's killed the --
estimate range, ship to whales!
that's ridiculous.
i didn't want to spoil our supper...
do you understand, neo?
all right. the truth?
looks like a fake to me. loan denied!
dad!
what trip?
that's all you got from him? that bastard helped take your life away from you.
put out a p.b.s.... or whatever it's called.
for the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
johnny, wait...
what is wrong with you?
maybe these are not men - not like us.
why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
it's a trap. there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it's just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
okay.
we had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. they ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
i don't understand.  it wants us to play the game.  it's been taunting us ...
fine. you're angry. don't be. the important thing is we're together now..
you're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
but be serious, darling. you are in danger and you must leave paris.
it's one hell of a job.  what do you put on your passport?  profession -- mel gibson's bottom.
anybody says anything bad about millie, i'll break his neck.
oh, well, i went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
then why are you doing it?
calm down.
people phoned in.
where are we going, sir?
did you handle the round, mr. wigand?
i must ask you to leave.
he's mooing.
welcome?
morgan, be careful.
why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was principal collins?
i can just feel my spirits soar.
is that all he said?
obviously.
and it's been blue skies all day. it might be perfect all weekend.
so?
more concerns than that?
four plus myers.
guy dressed for halloween?
bastard.
and the students?
no shit.
you're groping.  i have been fair. it's my move now.
who says i'm smart? you up to somethin' with bobby peru, sailor?
no, but i got something that might interest you.
can i come with her?
lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
meaning you can't even beam us back?
so now you tracked me down.  what d'ya think?
you posted twenty minutes ago. captain leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
i never c-c-carry arms. i'm... a writer.
what do you think?
we'll keep talking.  until they get here.  then... 
that what you got me up here for?
well, i didn't want to say anything, but i thought the dead man was my brother.
i would make you rich.
a man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
nick, you will help me find clyde -- won't you?
as for example, what?
to his hotel?
three hundred altogether, harry.
she's too valuable. she's got to know their whole network. the whole set up. we take her with us.
you didn't write to me for more than a year. what was i supposed to think?
bye-bye, boys.
i just heard. who is he?
where is it?
if i hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
is the hostage injured?
since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii.
in other words, god is one hell of an engineer.
you should have. i don't like leaving things unfinished.
shut up, ike.
i don't know.  maybe.
of imf agents.  at the embassy.  tonight.
max.
oh, come on! this is such bullshit! the work is getting done, david. lucky keeps me on top of everything.
i keep seeing dan fawcett's face.  they have such big windows at the school.  all the windows were broken. in dan's bedroom. all the windows.
he looked old, didn't he?
the fingerprints.
what...is...it?
i think that we should spend some time apart.
i know the code.
good work today, ms. woods.
we came out there, we'll go back.  a long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
her portrait?
an omelet! aren't you living a little above your ration?
yes.
what hotel are you staying at?
fine. i'm not mad. let's just drop it.
mary's a babe!
good evening. i'm detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell. i wonder if we could ask you some questions.
you know i think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. you look terrible, my dear.
okay, okay.  i suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by colonel mustard, with the knife.
is this your first job?
what?
i took these out of data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
seemed like weeks and weeks.  such a terrible dream... i could never tell you...
i don't have to do what you say.
he lived here with you?
shall we go into the living room?
i'm getting the jitters! let's turn back!
oh, him. he has a cat of his own. but his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw. goofy, if ya ast me.]
hmm? is that a professional opinion?
my.  it's gotten longer.
burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...

you are not allowed to act this way.
good party.
details, pokrif. from what i saw he had an incredible body.
well?
jim -- what's wrong?!
did you? you thought you did. we've been gypsed, all our lives. look at your street.
nice to meet you, wally.
you never said anything to me about having to prove i'm a princess!
i have a pretty good idea.
no baseball diamonds, red.
why do you say i'm self-conscious?
you said v'ger's purpose was to find and join with the creator.
they're going to draft me. in the army. i'm going to be sent away.
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
what's his line?
--you know how fuckin' easy this is to me? this is a joke!  and i'm sorry you can't do this. i really am. 'cause if you could i wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. the instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. the cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
do i put you off?
yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
rip van winkle.
don't worry. i'm gonna get you out of here.
the fbi computer holds files on twenty million americans.  i just hacked into it.
what's your air reading?
we started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
you broke some.
meth... methodology and technique...
he is very observant.
bela.  i just wanna thank you again for last night.
will it melt in there?
you saved my life.
i guess so.
a drink to warm up?
what about?
...and what's that, my dear?
claire, please don't...
stay calm, please.
well, i just want to know the procedure. i don't want to upset your routine. do you want any jam?
how's the arm?  still sore?
here's the money, and the phone. please, dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
i used to drive one of those.  a long time ago.
wrap her up in blankets. bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...done.
never show mercy!
i won first prize.
i called them. if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer, i'd sit closer. if i wanted to kiss him, i'd just do it. you want ron johnson? grab him.
no idea. but if that's all we've got left--
i'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. what would you say ray?
manchurian tung oil?  where did you get it?
nothing i didn't think of you before.
just move on. no one here killed him.
continued
what do you drive?
what?
they were slaughtering the spring lambs?
top of my class at west point, thank you very much. then off to redstone. first half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
you leave now.  take ticket somewhere else.  next customer in line...!
oh, yeah... 
what is it?
there's a small ledge.  it's a short climb.  you can make it.
hi....what....what's up....?
they're all yours, al.  good luck.
there is no fucking hand-off, walter! at a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
i'm thinking of investing with him. he worries me.
look...  do you wanna fuck me?
what's that, diz ?
no spare.
really?
where's junior?
no.
--what are my plans now?  well, next i'm thinking of tackling the yuba river in an authentic canoe from the algonquin tribe. --i'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only i'm not going <i>down</i> the yuba, i'm going <i>up.</i>  do you honestly think for one minute i'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
satisfied?
oh, will you stop attacking hannah?!
mickey!
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, ted. they knew your mom and dad loved you very much. they knew they did the right thing. but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
i'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
what happened?
detroit, you must be pretty busy.
how could you do this?
the green destiny sword?  you're giving it to sir te?
lizzy!
well, i just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
very quick. between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
need to go across the water.
she's not property, john, she's a person. were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
hey... let him out!
you look good...
uh-uh.  not yet.
what do i mean to you? i want to know. tell me.
hello, leon darling!
why don't you go back to where you came from?
it's weird...
where are they?
wait.
fair enough.
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic, 'it's a wonderful life.'
now remember, baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
yeah, oz, but not when she's on land.
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
they're going to rob that bank.
you weren't supposed to relieve me.
what about you, manuel?
i haven't changed my mind, westley, i want you to understand that! i don't like you! i never have!  i never will! that's clear enough, isn't it?
four hundred cases worth.  well?
that's what they all say.
heat is not heat! there's different kinds! and this heat is much hotter than what they got in michigan. you go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
we're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
oh my god. you're completely p-whipped.
someone...?
that's the problem. we need results. the press is driving us crazy over this p2p thing. calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. you know the sort of thing. it's getting political. the commissioner's getting very uneasy.
well, i've gotta be running.
what?
i can't leave my job, george.
when do we bring'em back?
so who's the guv? who we doing this for?
no, mr. lounds. you'll be just fine.
no kiddin'?
why you tellin' me that, sheriff?
then i'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
and this makes you "sad"?
baxter, you're not reading me. i told you i have plans.
hi, babe. come on. i've got a couple of things i want to tell you.
"eloi"?
you're an outcast.
we do.
he could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
i was mistaken.
that wasn't me ...
would you like another beer?
don't worry, i'm coming to get you.
will you let me explain!
uhhhh -- yes...
first of all, we'll have a nice dinner. try to find out where dorothy sings.
fifteen meters.
'stanwyk's parents, marvin and velma stanwyk, also of provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
paracelsus?
but that's not the point...
hello, miss channing.
what makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
we do!
archer, you're a broken record. fact is gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
don't worry about it. it's just a b picture. i bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. life is too short.
oh, i didn't mean....  i'm being such a grandma....
get the fuck out of here.
watch it with meyerling.  man's as mean and corrupt as they get. cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
i want to see-- 
he's a ghost. but he's a good ghost.
hello.
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that's why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?
it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
it's the waves.  god's music, my mother used to say. she was crazy for the ocean.
no!
tight security.  no guns.  real plus.
no, i can't have that! they'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
chambers - reilly. time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
listen to what i say --
that was a mistake.  the rain on my car is a baptism.  the new me.  iceman, power lloyd.  my assault on the world begins now. believe in myself, answer to no one... you probably got it all figured out, corey.  if you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
i don't know. hello, mom. hello, dad. something like that.
just to take the proper precautions, mr. gardiner, i'd recommend we take you downstairs and x-ray your leg.  ... by the way, mr. gardiner, i would like to ask you something straight out.
these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus.
you weren't there.
to kill me?
why?
ok.
you and your lucky geese.  you always see geese.
well, what's going on?
i've deactivated the sensory inputs. that flesh on your body is just meat, now.
i want to rehire you. to find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
gimme that. that doesn't concern you.
cal...
i'm sorry about this, mr. wyatt. i didn't know you had a daughter.
but... how is it you can see me?  you can all see me?
oh, meetoo! you look miserable! oh, vlad - look at him!
yes, i was--
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight.
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
my problem is i come here to drink in peace.  so if you don't mind...
fuck, man!  that's terrible!
there's a nice boy.
charenton? the administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
when it comes.
dance then? 
father it's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
is that a fact?
where's the girl? miss stone.
...like april.  it gives him gas. and make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
is something wrong, my friend?
i'm convinced. not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
what did you tell him about the baby?
costliest!
mr. wood, this is mr. reynolds, your landlord.  could you please open up?
where am i? what happened? where did we all go?
yeah. i'm gonna get my... i'm gonna get my camera.
okay. i know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
what happens in tow and a half hours?
somebody called you?
be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  have you lost much?
she was in the car with bob barrenger last night.  and she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
mind your own business.
are you a joker? huh? tellin' jokes?
i came clean. i told it like it happened on the boat. so what if i left out how i got there? it's got so many holes in it, the d.a. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. so you got what you wanted out of me. big fucking deal.
you got something to say?
and i'm listening avidly, fellow.
this is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
we talked earlier about your mother. and we talked about your father and his death. and i don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something -- something that i understand --
look!  this is a good one!
yeah, i see her.
no.
yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
salesman. what did bud and mary sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
i don't know.  it was...  there was a big gram or something.  and there's one, i'm like a prostitute...
there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
do you have assets somewhere else? bank accounts?
huh. you know, rick, watching you just now with the deutsches bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
i have been given nothing. god makes men what they are.
then why do i have to go to bed?
mommy read it to ne.
i'll have lunch ready by one.
you got a good memory, franky.
lieutenant!  it's me.
yeah, i'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
what shall we do?
you want to mess with superman?
the bones will be there when we get back. that's the nice thing about them. they never run away.  and besides, you got me into this. i don't intend to be alone with these people.
aaaah, bitter motherfucker... i almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
no, of course not.
wait! first i give you special fuck!
so cut both.
you knew it. you all do. it's part of it. maybe the most important part.
purpose of visit?
i'm off.
we're police officers.
they ain't got captains?
how is your wife, fredo...your marriage?
but you have never liked jason. you always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
well, george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. viznick is not psychotic. he's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
over sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
it's no problem.  i was just with everybody we work with.
so charge him with something...who's gonna know?
what the devil --
listen up.  you two are married as of now.  get used to it.
that's just great.  why doesn't everyone just take off?
when did the messages start?  the animals outside start showing up? after harry came out of the sphere.
this looks terrific, lucy.
get off of me! stop it!
le vingtieme siecle. we're meeting armitage there for the midnight floor show.
dear, dear, dear. whatever happened to you, my boy? mr. alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to julian. the water drips off alex's clothes. they look at each other.
it was just there.
i want the money, mark, that's all.
you really think so?
that's the call that i'm waiting for.
is that worthless brother of your there? i want you both ta hear this.
yes, with all due respect, i do citizen barras.
i gotta find him.
pleased to meet you, mr. warne ...
what?!
right.
you ready?
mr. caddy? my name's bob woodward, i'm from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
but you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
that happens, you'll get it back.
sorry. i'm still getting the hang of this.
we don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw billy!
you going away?
i sort of already have.
benjamin braddock.
of course--my god, you think something this big just happens? the break-in and the cover up, of course mitchell knew, but no more than ehrlichman.
professor marvel never guesses -- he knows! now, why are you running away?
it was supposed to be.  dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
but don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. don't tell me that you're not interested. i know you well enough.
a big one....
i'm making you feel like meat?
it's pretty old.
i see what you're doing....
connie, don't hang up.
rough, eh? oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. say, would you mind if i took a roll of the soft stuff back there. i see you sell the soft stuff.
she’s drunk. -er than me. but i didn’t really dump you, did i?
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies.  to the tree of the dead.  maybe we passed it by.
james. this is my editor, terry crabtree.
thank you, ralph.
up here, boss.
have you discussed this with anyone else, john?
anything?
holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
he'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
great. later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. right now i kinda have to hurry before i grow a lot of hair and eat people.  say this heart thing works. what's it got to do with adm?
it. bouncy-bouncy. fucked. he tried to squeeze my fucking head off. what did you say to him? when they reach each other, they stop. sheila seems to weigh her answer.
no, no that's fine.  so you doing okay?
how much did you pay?
i took it from my fake husband.
i want those men put back to bed, mister turkle!
how are the parental units functioning these days?
don't bother.  i'm taking a trip.
mother. i'm going to get married.
i don't love you.
and you blame me. it's because we never talk. let's talk.
relax.  you've done enough.
don't say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead.  well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
what...does it turn to?
only if i repeat them outside this room.  and, i will if i must...  out there, for all to hear.  or... you may speak, as planned.  but, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
we'll take it!
if he's dead, verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york, wasn't it? tell me the truth.
hey, i'm missing the party!
help me? how?
i do.  more than anything.  but i am also a realist.  soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  dog and pony show will finally be over, and i will go home.
is anyone there?
* thank you.							    *
honey, i gotta start makin' money.
i can't do this anymore. let's get some lunch.
lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
nothing.
that's curious.  i was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
is it snowing?
well suppose i hadn't come downstairs. would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
what were you like when you were younger?
i'm getting to your rug. my  father and i don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, i don't approve of his. still, i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
october 15th, direct flight, london heathrow to rio de janeiro, british airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. seven six five.
what?
it is my only object.
well i don't know.
then there was jerry, the actor.
larry....
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend?
hey, girls.
i have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
yes.  the bulldog's just gone to press.
casull .454 magnum.  you're talking twice the impact energy of .44 magnum hot loads.
excuse me. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, doctor. uh, alvy-alvy, that was the show. they said everything is fine. they found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
what was that?
it's a shark's tooth!
...but the word "yet..." yeah, you know what, i'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
i've had it.  just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean i'm gonna be one.
don't tell him you're here.
1 just did it for the reunion. i thought it would be fun.
i think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
&quot;those who travel far and near this will make you disappear!&quot;
we're not sure.
get in the bathroom!

that you were fired.
i will if you want to.
what do we do?
damned hunters.  it was a trap, and you were the bait!

nooo!
today's your lucky day, sami.
mad! darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. i love you for some of them - and in spite of others. i haven't let those become too important to me. they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. all right. but you will not sharpen them on me - or on eve...
my cousin will be here tomorrow.
how are we going to do all this?
i wanna join up, mr. rasczak. i think i have what it take to be a citizen.

what kind of person do you have to be to do this?
there is somebody...
he just let it explode.

jody and i.  and she was there, norman, she was.  it scared jody so bad she had to leave.

i would have preferred staying home, me.
no, yes. no, i mean yes please go. help me to be good. come back tomorrow. promise.
5:11.
down, oswald.  we have to talk.  you see we've got something in common.
goodbye, charlie.
ah, that's good. that's all that's important. back to business. back to work. bye now, father.
maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
it's been what, three years?
hello, charles. has everyone checked in?
friend?
you want to find them.
then you do think it was ambrose.
calm down. you're not going to jail.
well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
bed sheets.  i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. not the best material, but i haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
you'd take no offense if we called you dela for short?
need some help?
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
yeah, it'll satisfy me.
what?
i've always wanted a watch like that.
ah-ha. well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?
don't tell me i don't have a choice!
i mean it, give it your best shot, cause i'm tired of you holding that over my head.
i wouldn't mind a little night life. how about you?
i've located the suspect zero file. did you know there was one? koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
you were with him at the end.
yeah ...  that--and ...
well... to be honest... i'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm afraid i'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure.
it's contraband.  don't ask.  but i wanted to give you a treat.  a sort of... thank-you gift.
damn.
we may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
ah... restaurant supplies. i didn't get your name.
oh, fuck off. you should stay where you belong.
they're among the best divisions the british have.  no conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
mr. levene, i think we have to talk.
i was eating that.
yes.
don't worry, i won't report you!
wow.
get down -- where?
yeah.
yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through central park with the surgical masks on muttering.
what exactly did they say?
goodbye, dr. lecktor. you can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
but i told you, i don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
he did everything he could to take care of his heart?
i wasn't --
well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
ernie goose?  cynthia?
why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
do they believe in reincarnation? i believe in reincarnation.
maybe we should call the coast guard.
would you grab my shampoo?
you just came back home, daddy. i don't wanna leave right now -- i wanna stay home and be with you.
yes.
they're prisoners to their genes.
for what makes the world go round. for money, and for glory.
what is it?
it's good to see you again, uncle. i've missed you.
alright, cindy, what's so important?
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
who do?
no, you can't die of insomnia.
yes.
so... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
you don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
and what have i done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
fuck!
okay, mr. yow...
you afraid of violence?
we don't label people here, scott.
he i.d.'d the assailant. the description matches you pretty well.
that's a quarter of a century. makes a girl think.
no... don't say your good-byes, rose. don't you give up. don't do it.
huh? that's smart!
jesus! what?! you want money?!
you told him i was here and he wanted to know if i was beating you up.
we're outta motion lotion.
hi loretta.
she said i have a son...
i have to.
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet. now why did you lie to me? where did you go?
he called me chicken.
...you get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
i'm not ready.
well i might go to dartmouth.
no use, schulz. you might as well come clean. why don't you just tell 'em it's me. because i'm really the illegitimate son of hitler. and after the germans win the war you'll make me the gauleiter of zinzinnati.
well?
jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
zackly.
oskar, good of you to come.
how do you do. would you care to finish the game? i have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
yeah, sure.  you got change?
i'm afraid i don't understand.
hot tip,  rubber biscuit in the third race at arlington.
i don't know the steps.
hey -- your prayers have been answered. i'm leaving.  in just a couple of days.
don't sweet lip me.
they don't have extermination camps.
missus...
i notice you still remember it.
but how am i to know the good side from the dark?
morning!
you've acquired a taste for this?
no? no, what?
look, we don't know what's going on out there.  it may just be a down transmitter.  but if it's not, i want you there...as an advisor.  that's all.
well, then, what i am i doing here?  i assume i'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
what are you doing?!
why the goose pimples? if he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me! what are you doing here?
there, master fettes.  sooner than we had expected.  a stoke of luck one might say.
i have'na been able ta --
the best. but we won't need them.
good morning.
and what about big al?
stand aside, sam, nature's callin'.
i learned my fill from romeriz.
it hasn't been easy, has it?
he had a girlfriend?
well... i guess so.
so why do you think i should work for the national security agency?
you need to get a haircut.
-- a sense of proportion.
two hundred bucks?
dude. what are you doing here?
it wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  it wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
i also like bananas.
that's what i wanted you to tell me.
yeah.
it's taken care of, babe. you and i are going to make a big score tonight.  this will tide you over.
what's this about?
i've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in harrisburg, in lancaster and hershey.  asking about you.  i must say you have friends in influential places.
did she accept?
your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  i thought they were going to break my arm.
look at my ring.
you've always hated my taste in the past.
i love you.
it's the truth.
me?!
do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
we crossed our own tracks.
but, danny, if hashem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions?
hi.
no, i would have remembered that name. the only stella i ever knew was a parrot.  was this before leslie? before us?...
is this what you killed them with?
just wander.
love you, dil.
oh come on.
rita. i met her last summer. she's cool. you'll really dig her. she's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of provo where she raises chickens. i'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
if i had i wouldn't have gone in.
oh. hi.
hi.
you're welcome.
convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
you still have that watch auggie gave you?
i don't know how!
shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
then i have come to the right place.
who?
al's main squeeze.  is she here?  i'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
defend ourselves.  we've bested far worse already.
i'm freezing. what do you mean, tag along? from the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
'course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
can you turn off the game?
i'm sorry i sent for you, brad - i didn't -
am i supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
i said: cut it out!
yet we hear you are making an opera from it. is this true?
we have to!
you think she sure 'nough your sister?
oh my g-d, they want me to anchor.  they want me to anchor tonight!
i know.
ask you what? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
why doesn't that surprise me?
you're a fuckin' star! and you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
yes, sir, you bet i would.
we're all manipulated. from the moment we're born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.
aye, sir. on course to ceti alpha. all is well.
that's right.
i'm getting emotional. and i don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, hennessy?
it's friday the 13th.
the pitch, high heater. bucky knows what's coming. he steps in, smash, over the green monster.
actually, i just had an amusing thought.
conrad.
i'll pick you up.
you're a soldier, max.  that's what you were put here for.  but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
you need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
stop what?  don't blame me.  it's not me.
no.
or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
oh, i'm fine.
tonight?
the people. when they pay him homage, he adores them. but when they have the ... audacity to question him. to doubt him. to embarrass him. then he despises them.
look, the sky is blue...
yes, although, i really..... thank you.  yes, it's great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.
i'm sorry, i should have been watching where i...
i can see that.  why?
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god... and understand the word of god. not enough for you to hear what i'm sayin', you gotta understand.
that's connie rivers with her. they're married now.  she's due about three-four months.
yeah.
... would you take me on a tour?
think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
yes, i see.  about those lovebirds, miss...
nothing's wrong, i just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's frank's father --
if the western woods are truly the devil's glen, we will see for ourselves.
look, stupid, he's ten to one.  tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
thank you for inviting.
don't mind what?
they're not after you, they're after me.
yeah!
and who is this?
i don't give tours.
yeah?
and you've been extremely patient.
you never did like being called that, did you?
what, "this"?
it's different for us.
so what were they doing here?
so, <u>never</u> let beetle juice out. never.  besides...  we're thinking about letting everyone stay... you and your father and mother can stay too.
'bout the same time i busted doucet i tried to nail this big-time dealer. i didn't have an id, but i was close. too close.  gained the confidence of a badass named dubbs.  he was going to turn me onto the big man.  he made me for a cop.  mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
they tell me you're an american agent.
this is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
i never saw one that big.
please! please! what are those?
i don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, numa, it's none of our business.  let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
where does he live?  old man ... where does he live ...
well, i certainly... i think that's very- yeah, yeah...  yeah. do you love me?
you crave what i might show you.  what you can learn.  what i can give you.  so much more than michael can.
yeah.
somebody said i'm just another philistine. with reproductions.
not one of them today has what you had, miss davies. not one of them.
i'll concede in the morning.
hi. i, uh, think that's us.
hello. my name is lydia sinclair.
i don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in cross corners.
are you <u>real</u> mad?
no one's home.  checked it out myself.
i ought to belt you one, j.p.
jesus, ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
i got to hand it to you, homey. that's the best preacher hype i ever did hear.
oh, yeah... boy, that must've been a while ago.
no there are variables that, like, i might not be good at.
that's because you keep reminding me. if you go away then i'll forget.
kat, stop it. you do. you can’t even look me in the eye. you went back to the states when we split up.
we all have to like what we become. cowards included. we achieve this by complicating things a little. but it’s never that complicated really.
not just every six weeks.
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
do you wish it, jack?  wish you this our wedding band?
what happened?
oh, wow!
why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
he's preaching.
you're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. he's taller than me.
i'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
so he drags the cow backwards here. only he prolly didn't know 'bout the castavets had them dogs.
everything happens once if you live long enough.
fuck it!  he doesn't like me, john!  it's your fault, henry.
...you need to talk to me.
it's saturday night! there's still plenty-a action around!
it'll be okay.
i'm sorry to keep you.  how can i help?
i don't understand.
not quite.
who's benjamin?
i'm a witness to a murder.  that seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
saunders, i've lit cigarettes -
did you hear the child out?
but... the deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
over at tri-tech. one of the jobs professor lambeau set me up with. i haven't told him yet, but i talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
what's manny doing? i can't see him anymore.
like a blueprint for disembowelment.
you like patsy cline?  i just love her. how come, i wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
let me take another look at that ring.
i told you not to make that deal, saddam!
bianca's taught me all! need to know. i'll be safe, as long as i don't go too far.
so it's time to go home.
yeah, nicky loved restaurants. he was a real restaurant buff. and over the years, he always made money with them.
they wrong?
ju...
maybe i blocked it out.
hey, boss.  wondered where you'd gotten to.
never.
clear...
idaho?
yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
me too. that's stupid. name one thing we're gonna need it for.
stay here with me. me. me. me.  and kevin.  that's selfish, huh?
he was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
then, we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland.
mike's our attorney general down here.  i was just explaining to jeff, they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
this should cover it, auggie-doggie.
it looks fine. how much will it be, with my car...?
give me some credit, will you?
there's a bathroom upstairs.
i need to speak to you.
are you going to see him?
oh george, come on.
calm down. tell me what's wrong.
no i haven't...
i'm looking for someone.
you don't just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman.
this is like a movie or something.  i mean, am i paranoid or what?
really?
yes. but they don't have a clue.  why would anyone steal my luggage?
yes ma'am!
...and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? can you believe that? you weren't even charged. new york police - jesus. i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a. first thing in the morning.
nobody's going to hang.  we're all gonna walk away with a little something.  i ain't a greedy man. and, hell, you did all the work. one-hundred-thousand dollars.  split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  give or take.
dad, look what i drew.
never mind. where've you been?
i'll call him now.
come on.
wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
who is it?
yes, i can.
what do you think?  get us into that room.
they become complicated... messy.
something was definitely here.
i don't, that's all.
you look sharp. you understand?
they use no paint. and the audience think it is paint.
this hair.
i'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray, and i still don't have a shot at the title.
another dozen out back.
no, i'm not a lesbian. geez mom.
i don't care.
and you say, "santa, what am i gettin' for christmas?"  and he says, "cancer!"
then we'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization.
and what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? wander round lugging your suitcases?
yes, you used to do gymnastics. but you stopped.  why?
i think you're too used to getting you own way, willie...
murder, honey.
it would be truer to say, i think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
the point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
i don't think she's real big on hate.
alright?  it's bloody fucking freezing in here!
hey, tim, you know what? you win.
when you do this, i swear...
nobody give their right name ... it's the fbi!
what are they?
i'm sorry.
before i get off work.
 okay.  okay. 
where you been all day?
you're right about the old man. his power's long dried up. he's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. he says we changed, and we don't listen. well, he don't go out and talk no more. i haven't had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this hoss is gettin' watered.
no.
if there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth. this is your boy...  he folded the bottom part, including what lecktor tore out. in this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  we can make out: 'six-six-six'.  i didn't spot it until i had this high-contrast print. i advised chicago as soon as i saw it.
meaning what?
old habits die hard. are you alright?
pelting down out there.
mistake, no, it says e-flat, she plays e-flat. ping-ping. hit the right note, always. very proper.
is that liquor?
c'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
who the fuck is this?
that's right. that one.
your honor, bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
my god, alice.
after the jack-o-lantern.
nichts danke. kein.
i'm trying, marie, okay?
don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
dignan. take it easy.
yes, i wanted to get here before the others.... i want to talk to you alone.
josephine.
they're going to come to everyone.
that was billy ansel on the phone. he wants to come over to talk to us.
i detest serpents.
she already has.
<cardiac red alert> we're stopping the heart.
it's already posted.
how much?
oh, christ.
got a beer?
departing dark side, regula.
they just said they wanted time.
come sir galahad, quickly!
you sure? i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily. special blend. can't find anything like it in the states.
come on.
is everything all right?
where can i find him?
excuse me... you said earlier that mary albert just moved in.  how long ago was that?
i'm not going... you know that i'm not going... do you think i could leave you alone here? after that --?
mr. chance, i'm very pleased to meet you.
...you know.
her son drowned.  she brooded until her mind was affected. all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
no, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  we want to produce your play.  i have the contracts right here.
what about the legalities of this...?
one more thing, your honor...
hello, sean.
what happened?
josie, i think we should go public.
only what's right...
johnnie, what did i say?
how could anyone do this to joey. the best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. who'd want to harm joey? tell me— who?  -- who?
i always knew that you were special.
i'm hardly doing a thing.  the less i think of it the better.  my parents are arranging everything. the gous are a very powerful family. my marrying one will be good for my father's career.
it's been a while.
sure.
really.
your kid dropped it off.
i knew this would happen. soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee, i knew there'd be trouble. he's just got some kind of influence over her i can't decipher. there's somethin' wild in lula i don't know where it comes from. you gotta find 'em, johnnie.
i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today, said he went body surfing.
yes.
for poaching.  or, would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost?
and if the police stop by - what do i tell them?
she knows arnie metzger.
no fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. by anyone.
hard to resist, isn't it? the holy grail's final resting place described in detail!
again???
she'll be with her friends over at stu maker's tonight.
huh. that explains all the tannins. and how long in oak?
clarence...
doctor. jones. christmas jones. no jokes, i’ve heard them all.
what's your name?
he told me he had done two others just like it.
slugs? no. 'less you talkin' about that new waitress down at sloan's! ha ha!
can we blow it with just two?
ashley, jesus --
meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
it's been a long time.
this wing configuration. i've never...
in radio we're different.
... yeah.
squid?
no, don't worry, i moved on.  i was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "bride of the monster."
pardon me, counselor. before you continue...
ellie --
he was so brave. with courage alone he nearly won.
is this upsetting you?
i am scared. the things i do. the things i could do to you.
what, you're afraid?
it's all over, paul.
don't be late.
well, i'm not.
not about that.
yes, miss ratched...
when you read it we'll talk about it...
come on!!
what are you doing here?
yes... yes!  and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  why didn't he?
no, no, not tonight.  don't let her in here.  i have too much to do.
ha ha ha.  you are funny.   really, how much will you be needing?
you know this citizen kane picture? about pops and everything?
it's not any box. it's called the lament configuration. it's a puzzle.
you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. would it be asking too much...
a thumb? what do you mean, like cut it off? for ten bucks?  that include the tip?
i know my time's up, but i've got to get this out while i've got hold of it --
hey.
well, that's not gonna happen.
miss sellers, do you know dr. alan paley?
they were in a quandary, and—
it could have been a nightmare... sometimes they dream about the old murders.
no one's asking you to!
that's probably my office.
i just don't want it to get too heavy.  i feel really overloaded. i have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  but i know you have to deal with them at the same time, but i just, i mean i don't know why they have to happen at the same time, i mean, i don't know why, i just wish i could work out... am i just babbling?  do you know what i mean?
i... dunno. i mean, i guess not. no, they ain't carryin' no guns.
god, where the hell did you come from?  you scared me to death.
gentlemen--
boss, ain't you going to bed?
still a coincidence.  timing and all.
good morning, lovey.
please....shoot me.
don't talk about what you don't know. besides, she's too young for "the changes."
it's silly of you to be apprehensive.
of course i forgive you.  i know what you feel for danny is real.  and your choice is your choice.
well, yes, i was. but i was your father then, see?  but the real me, john doe, er, that is, long john willoughby, i was the fellow up there with the book. you know what i mean?
mister, can you visit anybody here?
besides, i'm not stupid, earl. the tape was a basic maxell d-80.  you can buy 'em at any store.  there's no way they can pin anything on me.
you grew up around here?
you were right about the telephones. there are no lines, there's some problem.
craig, remember what i told you.
how could you call him?
well maybe you should join a hippie commune. but let me tell you something. sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
you're not gonna come back, are you?
christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
congratulations.
if you're home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
the doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. karen sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. evans was buried. when we get zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
what is it about my writing that's so rotten?
do you know me?
there.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. she was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... it's always like this. it's always a fucking waiting game. i've been through it too many times already.
frank!  no, frank!  frank!
have a good sleep.
of what?
a name. grunemann. nothing. and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. then they asked me, well had i been getting letters, from someone out there in cabbageville --
it's a big, thick envelope, vicky. you got in.
what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
mr. marschal gets real lonely.
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. fire her. or something.
hi.
this "love" of yours will soon wear off. i gave you a temporary love potion.
are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
don't be funny.
hey there, chief.
we're late.
tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
sorry. boy i'll tell ya, if early found a picture of me like that i'd be black and blue for a week.
on which boat?
i don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
what is this shit?
i tried...
it means you're too hard on guys.
juno! god, you startled me. what are you doing here? what's wrong?
sorry.
let's pretend.  you're the department of transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  fuel injectors that burn people alive.
follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. that'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
what good would it do. no matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
yes, the lord's been pretty good to us. i guess you're a church man, aren't you?
around.
don't make trouble, all right?
well, well. small world, isn't it?
that's not true!
-- well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
today coffee----
go carole.  so, guess what?
all right ... i got some hungry people in there ... i want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
alone.
my favorite little cousin.
why are you doing all this for me?
just wanted to see for myself.  they're burning their documents.
max!  relax!  josh and jen'll put a spin on this.  we'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
you people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. i'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... what sort of training do you have anyway?
my neck, dog.  that's the last bag?
yeah.  his dream and our worst nightmare.
i agree it's ridiculous but --
they crashed it into a wall. a flight simulator.
oh, see - i killed it. oh, i killed that poor little honey bee!
if all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  how am i supposed to survive?  i'm giving birth in three months.  how do i get through this?
so do i.
khan!
ten is standard, sir.
the uzi 9 millimeter.
where have you been?  oh god, they hurt him, jeffrey. jeffrey, jeffrey, jeffrey, hold me. hold me. oh god.
and there's the sphinx.
of course. and you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but i'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. as long as people do that -- the country's all right. do you understand, martin?
i do this because i was there,
because if you are, you have to tell me. if not, it's entrapment.
betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
they're giving out. de-crystallizing.
you did.
who do you think gets through this gate into the united states of america?
glad to see you're finally with the program.
what happened to emma will never go away.  it's part of you now and it always will be.  but you have to learn to live with it...
the moment i saw you.
a horse?
boy!
tell you the truth, i don't know.  i started when i was eighteen, driving for my uncle cully and his partner, gus.  they go into a bank this one time in slidell, gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. all three of us ended up in angola.
why?
i do ... i cut "em...
at that close range, we won't last long against those star destroyers.
now, my flower, do you understand?
i will be the judge of that.
and what did they say about me?
all of it?
what made you do it? who paid you off?
us??  we'll never catch them.  any- way, we're all done, teemo.  let's go home.
well, jabez -- i'm a little pressed for time. you wanted to discuss something -- some business --
really. the california racquet club?
oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager danny took us to this restaurant and there was sandra bernhard.
ugh, what's that smell?
you're right.
[you want to talk, lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
looks like the tower.  it's a bad climb.
if you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
mr. hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  you have my sincere word...
here?
100 years! 
nine-thirty. general von pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. shall we call berlin and tell him the good news?
yes it does! we could be at sea for months.
you telephone, sir.
no, i'm not losing money, that's not the point.
what about you?
who are you trying to please? yourself?  her?  which her, this one or that one.  can you face both?  we are in a situation that is beyond morality.  so: leave with her.  you'll see the transformation.
knox, you gotta calm down.
oh, if i could write the beauty of her eyes! i was born to look in them and know myself.
i've changed my mind again.  what's new orleans like this time of year?  mardi gras.  or let's just see where the road takes us.
'joe...'
you liked him?
no, no. it's an honest question. what are you trying to communicate?
god, i haven't seen you since the wedding.
but first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
time?
just a roach, zook.
yeah, she came by last night. shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
slugdom. sluggishness. whatever you'd call it. i'm not there yet. i still have many human characteristics.
...who?... did she say how far apart the pains were?... when was that?... oh dear.
you had another one, didn't you? you have to see a doctor, grady. first thing monday morning. all right?
are you going to take her with you?
how do you get this thing down?
ow! these chips suck.
you want me to move the television set in here?  you play gin rummy?
come on, kid. i'll buy you a drink.
besides that.
maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  say that you'll do it for me and my friend, mr. fettes, here.
max.  this is anna.
were the lights on?
well... well, how soon would you want them?
you, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, chutney? after you shot your father?
don't worry, jennifer.  someday your prince will come.
i think he's 18 or 17.
still needs work.
i always suspected the effects might come back. that's why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
what plane.
what "magic" have you brought, erik?
i think you know --
janet, are you okay? are you there?
...i can't do it, wally...
we are clear and free to navigate.
you are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
you're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
get your clothes on.
but they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
c'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
so you say.
get him on the phone.
i was scared.  and there wasn't time.
go.
i can't believe you made love to her just like that. did you use protection?
<u>how</u>?
but on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
alexander.
what do you want me to do? pin a halo on you? you're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
such mortal drugs i have, but verona's law is death to any that utters them.
they know, i had no choice. get out of the house now! do you have a laptop?
so you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
what if i pushed to twenty-one...?
they were left over from the last shift.
alright. i'll start at the top, and work down.
hey, this one's mine, this button. this one, you rem-
i see you didn't dor, mayo.
where are we?
i tried to borrow a gun from chad, but--
what is her name?
so, our lawyers had a talk with the committee's lawyers.  that elvin clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. they cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
not a floater.  only just dead.
my girl back home. we're supposed to get married after i get my wings. she was tommy's girl. they were engaged to be married before he died.  i should've told you about her. i don't know why i didn't, except i didn't want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette.
yeah.
i want to settle this thing and be done with it. i don't want the archdiocese exposed.
stand down your weapons.
you can cut around it, whatever it is. you always do.
it seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
i never doubted for a second that i was.  will you come to the trial, elizabeth?
who the fuck are you?  why've you been following me?  come on, fuckhead!
well.
you look forward to this party all year.  what’s with you today?
we don't need no fences at camp 8, boss.
we came here to deliver some clean laundry.
her assistant?
what is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>god</u>.
yes.
you don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
look, i saw these guys, i can i.d. them.
and on my time.
da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded. the way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  isn't it wonderful?
hello?  is anybody there?
i've got to ask somebody.
i recall you.
the way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
who?
don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. don't want to see anybody.
i've suggested it myself. but i hate to even think such a thing.  she needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. we all go a little mad sometimes. haven't you?
alright, alice... you'll be contacted by inspector rock. arthur rock. he'll be posing as a politician.
this way, madame. are you alone? by the window perhaps?  or a nice little corner table?
we seek the fortress of krull.
a hundred dollars!
i think you are rather innocent, my friend. in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
sure.
what?
you're not going to ....
he's being arraigned tomorrow.
i'd say... who the hell is ron johnson?
waddaya gonna do now?
why?  you're a wudan fighter. training is everything.
why did you go?
look, why don't you and lila stay here and have your natural life. i'll just go on my way. you'll never see me again.
they also tried using viral r.n.a. as the bonding element.
is that so?  but what do you think of charles palantine?
sorry.
dope?
i killed him.
christ, it's oil of tansy!
no, no, betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. i should have known it all along. i'm kicking myself as i shave here. so, first thing we...
you must be exhausted.
give me some credit. i got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. this is never going to stop if we -
sometimes i'm afraid of the lightning.
it is nothing of a sexual nature i assure you.  one thousand, just to listen. i don't see how you could turn that down mr...
captain, this is saavik. we have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
okay ...
anna.  what's wrong?  what do you want?
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
some prophet guy?
three.
dr. zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
yes.  i had someone come to my door, someone i didn't want here and i told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. they left.  i'm sorry.
hi.
he's dead? that's fine. you won't see me shedding any tears over him!  oh george, you must take me with you!
ok.
nothing.
harp, let me tell you something.  i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?
they must've learned how to control water... i mean at a molecular level.  they can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  put it under intelligent control.
you know my policy. we don't negotiate with terrorists. if we start now, all of america becomes a target.
time?
yes.
fletcher, get away from there...
no.
just local, of course.
you can't!  we've come this far.  we must find them...
once warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. it's a completely brilliant plan!
nothing.
what are you saying?  that jon is radioactive?
plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
no, i - mike - wyncha sit over there, i'd prefer that.
black suits and helmets.
i've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
lenny? come on!
it's... behind... us.
tell him we're busy.
i guess still in the locker.
is jeremy okay?
no one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian.  they assembled him at o.c.s. out of spare body parts from dead g.i.'s.  i know this for a fact.
"a high court judge has confirmed that mr. gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor mr. khan resisted arrest." -- i told you about english law.

you're breaking my concentration!
hey, what did you want? a lot of fatherly bullshit? a big pat on the back?
edith was just telling me about her job.
you are home. there are lots of kids you still know here.
listen, i want to be absolutely frank with you. i have no business in moscow.
i've got concerns.
that is the racket harry lime organized.
i think she really likes you ... where's mrs. peel?
mister mcmurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
you don't remember me.
find anything interesting?
i'm carrying it.
jackie, are you back on narco?  i need copy.
oh, shit!
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
what you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. ya know, if i keep on killin' people like i have, i won't have no more friends left!
you fuckin' piece of shit.
mother.
give me the keys.
well what power lines, will?  where?  maybe we should call someone about it.
english weather. you know, after all we've been through, i should say we deserve a long holiday ...
uh-huh.
damn it! you can’t fucking walk away from this!
i'm the man they're 	protecting. i'm the president. i'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
that will soon pass. it's nothing.
somebody has to.
thing we can lift it?
1,000 kellicams, closing!
didn't have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite...
like what?
oh.  no.  sorry.  i'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . i mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
bud! where you been the last two days?
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
i take it you learnt to live with yours then. take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
mr. president!
we're too late.
i just hit it like you said.
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  bring me the child that i might live again.
yes.
oh, no. no, it's a... it's a traffic thing. no big deal.
yes.  i've missed it.
what people?
it used to make me laugh .but.
no. i saw nothing.
you were not.
did you just call me a fuck-ass?
what was that....
actually, the boy's quite astute. i am trying to kill him. my evil associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
i want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion.
captain, i gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
this is an official visit, then--
porters?
you’re the lantern man, huh?  if you wanna see what’s left of him...
you could have knocked me down with a feather -- selectman -- me.
no.  i said that.
so how do we do this?
but this is...
did you get the letter?
where are you?
he can reason? with the tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
you think i should hang around more with the crew?
well there's a couple --
the fastest in the world.
why not?
miss farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
hey.
i won't tell mom if you don't.
whatever happened to women in back?
what are you doing?
it galls me to watch you. you can do as much in days as i can in years. men like the 'the dreamer' are protected. out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
i didn't mean to bite him. he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and i bit him accidental.
thanks.
well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the brain. so we've decided to put a surgical team and a crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an artery --
is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
again:  what is the magician's weapon?
i said we're getting out of here. back to civilization. i made a deal with the porters. they brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. they're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. come on, get your things together. where's your top coat?
anything from the bank?
--and who do you think he's handling? he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. and for 20 years he's been alone because of that. and if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. and i'm not going to let that happen to him!
i'm worried, ray.  it's getting crowded in there.  and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
no -- mama doesn't dream about you any more, walter. you wouldn't know the old girl now.
"dad?"  dad.  the boy wants tales of derring-do. name a country.
what if i say no?
i'm going to my desk.
china.
yes. they're in this antique doll house in my room.
i never tried to get you to like me.  i tried to get you to love me.
no, i like music. just-they're-huey's too... black sounding. for me.
who is this?
i don't know about that i don't have any money i don't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend.
i had one there for little bit. hit didn't get old enough to play with.
and do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...where's linda?
he didn't mention the money.  what he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! that's what i want you to do something about!
i'll be a few minutes.  wait here --
and when she goes to those places...
which one?
hey, the dude's holdin'.
cocky little bastard. i hope he was a baddy.
alice is dead?
look, this is serious now.  they're talking serious money --
fish are creatures of habit.  they like their food where they're used to it.  at the top, hiding in old leaves.
well!  aren't we the daring one? what's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door?  the antenna is gone off her car again.  i had no music, all the way to the market.  let me find a garage for it?
levoi, cooch. raymond levoi, criminal division.
uh ...
how did you know?
please, starla. i'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  we won't keep books.  go on, unpack mr. gillis' things.
i need you.
he's very strong physically.
kiss me.  before i cut.  just in case.
until you, or anyone else ...
that so? well, i'll tell him. hey, that sounds great! oh, baby, i knew you'd come through. now, here's the point. mary, mary, you're in on this too. now listen. have you got any money?
we're lost!
you don't really think tuttle and the girl are in league?
because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
hello, brad -
how do you know?
ev-i-dence.
you're lying, mimi.  but then, you'd do anything for money.  you're getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
are the disks still in your room?
why would we--
mary, i'm going home.
i don't know.
and my son, the only son of harold ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
what guy
hey... i never said you was a pussy... always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
all the things that happened to you before make you know that...
ummm . . yeah. luis is calling me tonight. i need to be home for that.
frostbite. gangrene. a simple diagnosis.
miss rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
who was that man?
-- hey! next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
now you better cool out a minute, boy.  you already almost got your head blown to pieces.
-- violation of the major crimes act on an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of instigation. i know that.
buddy, that was business. besides, you have more crew. then there's you...
this is all that survived?
no, he covets. that's his nature. and how do we begin to covet, clarice? do we seek out things to covet? make an effort to answer.
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father.
didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. is that normal?
i said let me see your hands now!
you decorate this yourself or did mrs. chief of police help you?
hm.
yeah, right.
i might not be able to.
you look marvelous. there's nothing to say. you're going to marry luis. next week, no less.
we've arranged for you to take the blame.  everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
i did.
sure a lot of guys lookin' for lednov.
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? he'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
you in a hurry?
well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
i -- i don't know, dear... perhaps there's some mistake.
so caesar, what did it total out at?
yeah...who is?
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
thelma!
no one in rome has ever heard of him.  do you want to remind those few in the senate who have?  the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  forget about him.
my stock's falling.  isn't yours? those pennies are costing me millions.
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. anything.  don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names.
well, he has a straw hat--
i sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! what did i do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
i told you,  we're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and i mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
if i activate them now, captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
god, i think i need a holiday.
--i got a trip to mars.
well, it's not called the horn resounding for nothing.  you do know how to play the horn, don't you?
it's ok, booth, it's no big deal.
this is his fiancee.  who's this?
beautiful, wasn't it?
what?
come on russell!...  who the fuck's russell?!
i want to tell eve.
i'm buying bananas tonight.
i see where you're going.
not now, mammoth. adonis is right. we've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. we chould be resting up.
remember, pay attention to how she talks about foley, her tone.  do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell burdon.  tell her you think he's a nice guy.  no, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  if she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  i bet nothing.  so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  you think that's possible?  what kind of guy is he?
amnesia?
i feel really stupid.
i don't know what the fuck you are.
people get tired.
a regular all-american guy?
problems?
come on, frank. let's go. please.
but not nice enough to marry--eh?
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr. bertrand's mouthwash? i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
we're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
i was thinking about that story you told me, about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
hello. get me the police, please.
how about some steak sauce?
tom, i've got something real big for you.
your assignment is to pick the class. find some other students just as special as you.
i don't want to listen to her sing -

we have to go after them, find where -- !
i shouldn't have done that. i should've walked.
whoa!... the government. they control everybody's mind. you're too fucking stupid to know that?
no shit. i got no problem with that.
good.  so.  is it my job?
you know, april, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  i get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
it can't wait until tomorrow...
i will, sir.
what'dya think?
<u>it's uncanny</u>.
throw your weapon, detective!  now!
so?
no oxygen to the brain.
what're we going to do?! where're we going?!

that's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, i want to be beautiful.
...yes?
hot dog! just like an organ.
well what do you think it is?
i remember fine.  i just didn't understand what was going on.  they never told us anything except what to do.  it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
yes, sir. the rift effects all long-range communications.
some limey. he's a middle-man for somebody. he doesn't say and i don't ask.

i really want one.  one large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
i'm an english major.  you like english?

what are you gonna do? they're euro- trash.
... people that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... my parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  i don't want us to be that way ellen.
he says... he says i must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  do you think he's coming from the sky?
solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
well, thank you for your help.
he's not with us, xander. he must be with you.
so that's it, huh? you get the cops to give you a safe ride.
yes.
already working on it.
isn't he chairing the armed services hearing?
thinks he is. well, he is.
did you bite it?
exactly.
mr. saavik, all stop.
did you do that?
that's not it.  my dad told me not to go.
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
ok...it's open.
a dead head.  water logged timber. floats straight up. you sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  muncy! engines to half!
well, then, you must come back and visit.
there is no such thing.
-- do you know what these are, elaine?
okay.
i just... who what?
. or do you just want me? i'm going to let you enter me now.
okay. now we're going to buy you some clothes.
well he said...  you know in his way... you know what i mean? besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. so, dr. scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. he's laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. you know how he is.
you fucked me, diego.
have you got a license?
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
they sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
you want me to speculate on what you do. i'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on beaumont to the stewardess. that means paperwork. i have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. an indemnity agreement --
-- she already is.  simone's not coming over, elaine.  not tonight, not ever.  i want you back, elaine.
okay.
mr. sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
i'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
he despises everything i stand for. he thinks i'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
you fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
so the casket fell over! big deal!
sure!
who?
how deep does it get?  that water's cold and i can't swim.
oh.  you must have been, uh, very unhappy.
he's going down.
you know, now that i hear myself tell it, i'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. what, you get the helmet monday through thursday, then brock takes it for the weekend...
that's a great idea.
nonononono. truce, you guys. listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? a wake up call for the nintendo generation. we demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child, but when i became a man i put away childish things.  what... it's corinthians i, chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. come on.
yes, eve. i know that.
you would have met in some shower eventually...
i'm sorry, stew. i asked hank, and hank did the rest.
hi.
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  like on t.v.
no, but i can never tell her that.
yes.
unfortunately, no.
so let 'em. look, i'm going to cook dinner for us. we'll have the fruit cake for dessert. you just sit there and rest. you've done enough for one day.
you told them, didn't you?
i don't believe it.
have you no natural resources of your own? have they even robbed you of that?
cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  nobody wants to go.
kim denied it. but he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with duane lindeman.
why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
so why don't you just tell her!
why wasn't i made aware of this bill?
well, i'm as human as the next man.
you can't fight'em that way...
hey, i can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
you okay -- ?
is the english dead?
the bomb.  he's reactivated it.  and everyone there is going to die.
do you?  then why don't you go out? meet someone.  make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
i don't get it, you get a scholarship to nyu, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
oh, come on, look who's talking. you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  you should smoke some o' this. you'd be off the couch in no time.
i can only speculate as to the reasons why.
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
very smart indeed.
you're planning to speak?
to see how long it would take for me to realize.
hello?
it's weird.  chang, how old are you?
oh dear, are you actually laughing?
watch out!!
oh, for chrissakes. it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
talk to her, sidney...
you look like a rock star without a job.
i would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
he said he didn't know about it.
i'm only asking for one thing. and it's not an extravagance. it's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
something's not right...
what do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
is there milk in them already?
i don't know about that.
into what?
yes. why?
the germans were here.  the germans were all over this area.  they left mines everywhere.  pianos were their favorite hiding places.
you missed the point.  the kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  he thinks he's in good standing.
cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
y'know, jessie, doesn't frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you frank?
karen. wow. look at you...
god, flash can be such a jerk.
i killed him.  when i was 15.  he was my first.  nah, wishful thinking.  liver cancer.
hey, boys.
why do you want to do that? why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
god exists because you're horny.
he's right.  we wouldn't have started it.
come on.  beats study hall, doesn't it?
what's this?
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian.
i must of been outta my mind.
well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney. maybe you can ask her.
ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? i mean... look, you're so drunk. i like you. i trust you.
i've been crazy about you for years. i've seen every picture you've ever made six times. i'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
cool.
show me the animal, jerry!
you did it.
ooh, wow, nice. personal trainer? very nice.
ms. toller.  i'm asking you now, under oath, did samuel lonbardo rape you?
mrs. hinkle, are you insane?
swimming with his hat on?  that's original.
what if it isn't over?
what?
the vice squad?
what's goin' on?
negotiating with whom?
you're irresistible.  i lose control.
i'm not sewing anything else for you!
that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.
it's haunted just the same.
where are we now, commodus?  can you see the camp?  my gods!  the air is turning into ice!
what's the point with hooks and lines? --
where could it have gone? how could it get across the water?  they're only lions, yes?
no.
thorstenson gieselensen. he just separated from his third. he's in fish. he is fish.
what do you say to him?
right on -- he's been waiting for --
here, pick these up!
geronimo is down.
so why all the secrecy? why aren't you guys working with the us military?
that's the truth.
miller...
not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
what did he say?
forget it.
really?
i have to go back.
hell of a war.
that's wonderful.  poor josephine.
moreover... he was a lucky man -- that man.
in just a second. two...
excuse me, i'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the sisters, and to keep you from things like i just seen out the window. my own daughter arm-in-arm with terry malloy. you know who terry malloy is?
what's wrong with you?
what's goin' on, boss?
i know i give him four threes.  we can't let him get away with that.
what the hell?
oh yes, great. the only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
not if they're looking at something else.
what about him?
you have to help me.  please, weaver. think of all the things i've done for you!
even my own wife, chief,  who's wondering where i am?
oh, and god, alvy, i did... this really terrible thing to him. because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
hey, vaughan. how are you, karl?
i'd prefer not to be the president to push the button if i can avoid it.
stay near the house, for christ's sake- someone's killing people. i have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
you probably don't.  how could you?  you're so terrified of your own emotions ...
--don't concentrate on segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
you must have a visa or something...
okay, wilhelm, go home now. go home and think about these past twelve years.
letty, dinner's almost ready.   the souffle...
what is it, sam?
that was just perfect.  you've ruined me for anyone else.
... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
hey, partner.  grab a cup.
i know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
dinner...tonight.
something came up.  c'mon ben! i've got a shoot at three...
good. that's good.
ok lassies, i think it's time you get to gripping reality.
this is the ace, betty.  but not of spades.  they'll find out about the other.  they might know already. and when they get this--  what would they look for?  where? out there somewhere? 
look... that's awful generous and everything...
no way. you have this -- destiny.
he fled. they still can't find him.  my mom and i had to change our names and stuff. i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool.
wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
good way to get your head blown off.
let's send his cut back -- just keep going.
who we gonna beat?
wake up.
ah, yes, ah yes.  our doctor lechter... and have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  how terrible for you...
i said you're beautiful, nyah.
aha!  is she young?
of course.
well, she's got a point.
was he bruised up this mornin'? about the face?
...lily...?
ok.
the way i see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
what?! why would you call me a pigfucker?!
let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
well, bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against chimera.
sartorius wants to destroy it.
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning. cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
i...i can't explain it.  it's just something i feel.
no sense at all.  i'm a little stressed.
would you remember his name?
i promise, jack...
they're tight.
you got it all worked out, don't you?
your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  i want you to have it checked asap at a gas station.
brother shamus?  like an irish monk?
--it is the old wound, that has been opened. i have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. let my heart do its job, my king, and pump me empty...
... we're with franklin, jennings and roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
how long has he been dead?
what the hell is happening, worf?
why are we stopping here?
ha!  not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
you'll never have another chance to hit me again.  i never knew till this minute -
don't stop.
you killed two men, ben harper.
that you've been to susan?
what's the matter?
sounds good to me.
well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, i thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
are you...okay?
you don't need the diary, dad. marcus has the map.
see? i'm psychic. not completely, but pretty much. that was pretty good, wasn't it?!
it's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
cut away from me?
...so the whole book winds up, mike hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. so he says, "you rat, you are the murderer." so she begins to con him, you know? she tells him how she loves him. and then bam! he shoots her in the stomach. so she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "how could you do that?" and he says, "it was easy."
mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  i mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
what's the matter?
maybe.  and maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this i'll put him behind bars myself!
mr. howard is so heinous.  he's always giving me a hard time.  i get a c-plus on the test and he tells me, 'you have no sense of history.'  i have no sense of history?  he wears a brown tie.
hey, i'm sorry.  when i was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, i forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
you're wrong. things happened today, okay? things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin.
fred duggar?
but he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
roy?  you still with us?
dr. frankenstein?
afraid so.
or i might end up with a broken nose.
yeah, here, i mean, where else?
your father??
does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you?
oh chet, that feels fabulous,
you know...stanley...
what do you mean?
pictures.
mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
what can i do?
what was that you said about a pet shop?
this is an incredible story - about a man hunting an ostrich, he's been telling me about zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an ostrich.  i'm telling her your map is poetry. the arab shrugs.
madge. please. something's happened. i've met someone. i've fallen in love in a way i've never thought could happen my entire life. it's our last day together. i feel like i'm going to die when he leaves. please. help me.
you can't swear on these.
listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. if you did know, you were in on it. either way, you're out!  get out! go on.  let's go.
hello?
he always was opinionated.
you said...
yes...yes, that's true.
i'm calling on people who knew mr. kane. i'm calling on you.
i've got so much power to give you, swann.  all you have to do is...beg.
you see for me it's over. over baby. i'm gonna turn myself in. after the wedding of course. after the wedding. out of respect.
great.  i got one b, two c's, and eight incompletes.
that's okay. i'm sure i'll remember the way.
he is. i mean, i've always thought he was. i think he must be. is he simple? or is that just something i've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
hello? yes this is mrs. macneil. operator you have got to be kidding i have been on this line for twenty minutes.  jesus christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
psychic awareness. right.
what... ?
rex. get away from the door.
elizabeth, i hereby withdraw my proposal.
certainly...
you know... sometimes people can surprise you. sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
so you were never a prostitute?
i'm kidding, emmi. what about a record player? you have that, too?
i should hope not.  i hate you!
i'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
when we had trouble before it was different.
all right. give me a voucher for expenses.
oh sidney...
you're still not listening! i'm not..
oh, did you -- care for the poem, mr. burns?
andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
don't be coy.  i've always known about your feelings for each other. all these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. you're both wasting precious time.
he left us.  we were no longer of use. saavik where is  the reliant crew? dead?
when evil returns so shall we.
we'll be there.
what are we going to do with him?
beg me again!
what do you want? why are you here?
stop fighting and get out.
you're polish?
what are you going to do with me? are you taking me to jail?  you think i will turn into your informant, is that it?
even if money wasn't an issue, dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
the prison of belle sur.
yes. and i also want to leave this city.
how do you manage to put up with all this confusion? you always said people bore you.
who is she?
just get her drunk.
i don't believe this.  the world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
of course.
you like patsy cline?  i just love her.  how come, i wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
i needed to know.
your murder weapon?
he's not showing it until it's down.  but it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  you and robert got great ratings today. which is the first thing we needed to know.
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
no, no... don't say that. bad word.
then i will go with you.
he's not home.
hey, betty. are you okay?
i say, will you have a cigarette?
you've got someone in your office.
no. i ain't see anything like that.
she wants you to paint the ashtray.
yes.  right.  good thinking.  you figure it out.  i'm tired.  i'm gonna take a little nap.  wake me if there's a fire.

mhravitch.  remember that name.
you tied the cord around its neck.
you're <u>happy</u> for me and victor.
you see, everyday i have my friend john here bring ...
he's grubbing for money, father.
i wouldn't say that --  what would you like to have for diner? there's onion soup and canned asparagus --
that's perfectly all right.
give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  what do we pay mookie for?  he don't even work.  i work harder than him and i'm your own son.
you trust him.
almost certain.
that comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
what about your bags?
it's lisa sherman. but she still looks like we're eighteen.
so you'll dredge the bottom again. you've done that before. the results were... uneven.
cardiac arrest.  during delivery her heart stopped.  when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  you get brain damage. that is why she's in the state she's in today.
why did he go to see mary rooney?
yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
how can you be so casual??!
deb... it's me. i need you to step out front.
mm. ordinarily i wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
a wider option of what?
i'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. however, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. i get the same dough whether i work or not.
yeah, an hour.
my god!  he's so excessive!
i knew that set-up was too good to last .... i'm going to miss it.
i mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
i'm good at languages.
yes. i am. what else could those words mean? i believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. and we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, marylin. you have more experience at this than i do.
please, sir!--come with me!
but she mentioned beaumont by name?
otherwise what?
scully, get somebody to open this door.
it's o.k...it's o.k...lets me help you up.

how do they know that, you told them?
i'm just screwed.
not all that pasta.

did you feel that?
you can't kill me like this.
ms. kramer.
the containment, second containment...
i hate you! i hate you! i wish i was never artificially created in a lab.
buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if i kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should i put this? they'd be officially discouraged.
shhh... remember this is a privilege, so i don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. kay?
and you knew he'd be here.
time out....jason dean. your pop's fred dean construction. must be rough. moving place to place.
she's still dead.
and what makes you think he's in this territory?
it doesn't matter...

internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  no definite signs of tb, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
juliet does not come on for twenty pages. it will be all right.
hello?
no.

have you cleared all the rubble up?
it's true.
so what's the problem?
jesus...
tammy lynn baxter.
uh...uh...what is it?
that was my choice, nothing to do with you. i took a chance, and it didn't work out.
thank you.
okay
oh. i see.
i have money.
we could work together. then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. there's a beach in bora bora with my name on it.
beverly center.
well, it's kind of skanky. isn't that what you girls call it? skanky? skeevy?
he'll be weightless.
we were supposed to draw a picture. anything we wanted... i drew a man. he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
your lucky laura's doing so well. if it wasn't for her, i don't think either of us would ever sleep...
no.  and he ain't been eating so good, either. he's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
come with us, sir.
yeah. do i have a case?
here.
what?
you know how to work a radio, don't you?
you don't have to do this. we could just cut out of here, go to akron,  or anywhere else.
every other sunday.  i'm heavyweight champion of the west virginia.
i've been worried about you.
who the hell is jimmy?
finish yours?
just tell me who's closer to the wall?
we've got to find out what it is. can you handle that?
i'm not a thief.
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i don't fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i gotta do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. i'm the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i gotta do? i'll do anything.
lloyd, it's us.
wonderful, wonderful.
where am i -- exactly, sir?
yum. this pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
<u>i</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>maine</u>.  that's ridiculous.
i just can't trust you anymore.
i like popcorn...
it's ok.
that guy's not going to make it.
no, i wanted other things for you.
yeah.  like the attic.  heh, heh...
nice, huh?
and what do you do wh...
and you're worried about him.
what about captain medley? he never told them what happened to you over there. his testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
they're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker. why, in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
sir, i think no such thing.
i had to leave this place. i got depressed, seeing all the crap. and the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? they've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, i can't believe it.
eric!
don't make it worse, dad.
well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  now if i were to offer you --
his parents took his car.  they're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
what do we do?
then you don't see him for a few days?
you got a date already?
<i>                      that's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
in my case it's necessary. too many taxi drivers write plays.
it was a community service.
you knew about the squid not being normal.  before fletcher went out there?
this is gwendolyn ichiban. this is my very good friend patrick bateman. where are you going? we're going to nell's. gwendolyn's father's buying it.  where did you get your overnight bag?
and you are?
so, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
i don't know.  i'm just not.
who the hell do you think you are?!
so when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
can i join you?
what's the matter?
no! gosh! i better get moving here, miss saunders--  everybody else calls you just plain "saunders." why can't i?
but suppose some business comes up...
they come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
of course just like that.  that's how you always know when it's right.
we might as well do the towels the same way.
it's cochrane.
and do you know why?
our peter?
i'll jus' walk on down to the pacific, and from there i'll... improvise.
i'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
yes... if you have a chart on board, i can show you.
excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
no, no. thank you.
okay.
no.
how often do you test, director?
well - no - i think i'd better wait. yes, yes. i will. i'll wait.
sorry, baby... when's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
you've got it on tape?
aah! i've got no stomach for that any more. i've had that kind of life.
what about his first born?
make sure you find ben, bring him back here. and keep it quiet. i don't need this to hit the press.
we're both gonna leave. leave the island. i've been talkin' to tricks. we think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. they're crated up real small. they've got air canisters. there's food inside. even a little motor.
oh my god...
he has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing.  i figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
karen, i told you not to--
i won't pay for nothing.
please, bill. what happened, it's my fault, i know it.
but, what if i go into labor? that could happen any time.
really.
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
yah. where are ya, margie?
yeah.
what?
oh?  perhaps someone pushed you then?
answer affirmatively. simply. keep those answers to three words. you weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. isn't that right?
how so?
mind if i have a look?
asked what they looked like, that's all. christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
i see the prince of wales is here.
i do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
forget about all that.  you want to do the right thing?  then defend your name.  if someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  i know the law, and the law's on your side.
no... i didn't.
good luck.
no problem. thanks for letting me crash. it was the best sleep i've had in months. i used some of your soap.
rinka.
i was awake and he was in my room.
oh, tracy... i have to tell you, i'm not the one to talk to about this.
and this is how he came to the boat?
yes! and my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who i was, just like mother. the things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
up until now, dad, i've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
write her.
yes, i'm right?
no, not that i recall, i was asleep.
all these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
i'm gonna take her home first.
oh yeah...
right!  that's what we're shooting for.  mister davis and have been in contact with the state department, but right now relations with the turks aren't too good, nixon's upset the hell out of them. our best bet's... right here.
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
hi frances, got a minute?
of course, he's concealed about me person.
you okay?
we didn't even really have it.  i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is "don't drive drunk." i was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
i love you man.
for who?  the fish?
that's some face they left hanging on you. you look like...
i bet you could do a book.
don't worry. i'm not telling anybody about this.
okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
so, what do you do?
about what?
we have a bus to mexico.  arrives in two hours.  have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
got all a's this year. teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
do you know where he got the dumper?
well. that was all took away, son, by the police. new regulation about compensation for the victim.
it's gonna work, dad.  we're gonna stop him.
then, where are you going?
i... i mean what're you talking about, ray? i haven't done anything funny.
see anything?
he wasn't lying about marco:  he's thirty stories down on the street. the other man is heinrich, and i found his body upstairs.  and his bag is missing.
listen to it for christsake.
sure!
he's going to cheese, i tell you. nobody arrested him!
for dana, schmuck.  bring your kid something.  you know.  the dad thing.
and who is she?
is jean michel here?
what's this?
yes...?
beth and harry?
that's a chimney swift, all right.
yes.
whatta these guys want?
why are you doing this?
when the left hull goes, so will the right.
you imagined it.
mitch, let's turn back.
that's good, isn't it?
maybe it's true then what she said.
well, that's more like it. at least you're speaking to me.
here are the keys to my apartment. i'm going to park you in my place while i take carol home.
no choice now, scotty!
you'll whip me!
he thought, perhaps, your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
max, the cab driver!
who did you call?
good.  now you'll hear from me when i have the new coordinates. in the meantime don't bug me.
here's your shovel.
we have that all figured out. you see, harry'll take my job at the building and loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
people cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. not if you have their love. you hadn't. that's why you're not in russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
there is no quantum flux and there is no auxiliary... there's no goddamn ship  do you get it?
i'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--what did you say?
no, that's okay.
gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  the latin term for that sentiment is "carpe diem." anyone know what that means?
yes.  in the church at domremy.
not tonight.
excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. dinner will be ready shortly.
you don't ever get scairt, do you, ma?
i wonder if my editor's psychic? reports from the greek front are going to be a little vague.
you just put mustard on your hershey bar.
why are you so anxious?
we're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
charlie, that's mean. come on in, ted. don't listen to mr. wise guy here. he's a joke a minute.
i want the rest of the pictures.
teenagers are weird. and you're the weirdest.
he should be caring. that is not too much to ask.
was she that bad?
i'm sorry, elle, i just --
aren't you?
like a used car salesman.
and did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
what about transportation?
yeah, right...
champagne please.
but if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no jody.
he didn't ask me to...
the ship will sink.
why don 't the zulus attack?
you are to be killed, exactly. they'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  if you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  a gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
sid i can see you!
no john, i can't. i can care for you, but i can't cure you.
why don't you? i'm writing a script and i'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
for not believing you.
really?  what did white say?
sheriff deeds' dead, honey--you just sheriff junior.
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
need any company?
so, why didn't you come?
first wes, now you?
that's a wig you wear, isn't it?
is the flight full?
the what?
that's what i been thinkin' about. how you been keepin' me.  i ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
not compared to that "cobblepot" person you're promoting...
yeah, but it's not just that. to the czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. if it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with oswald.  another lunatic acting alone,
hang in there, buddy!  you can make it!  just -- take deep breaths, i'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
oh, something. . romantic?
did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
mr. barton, do you remember me?
what case?
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  his parents are at his bedside.  fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"...
well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
aren't you the bitter one.
triple time sounds like a lotta money, bud.  it ain't.  i'm sorry...
conrad has the phone number. conrad, where is he?
naturally.  so what is your problem?
asshole!? i'm not the rope-totin' charlie bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
be good to her, my lord!
right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
do you have the material?
six months advance pay.  six months!
we don't have much time.
we make our own lives, madam. as for malignancy, i don't think so, it's very unlikely. i probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
fun though, wasn't it?
to do what? if they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
i don't like horror comics.
my third great uncle - the earl of aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese.  his son-in-law - george harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into shanghai...  his son, thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... and my grandfather henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first english newspaper.  it was a city of unlimited possibility.
speak english!
then the informant is real.
how d'you mean?
not talking. writing.
did you get anything on the cameras.  video or anything?
<u>don't touch him, watch it</u>!
tim!  lex!
i'm not sure i do, archie.
you just won a trip, you dolt! ten days in fhloston paradise for two!
that guy i brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. he's gone.
and ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
why didn't you bury those people?
oh, in show business.  well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
i want to give you an oscar.
i love you.
oh, no...
interesting.
because i wanted to.
well i don't think i'm old enough and besides i don't want to have a baby.
but i don't want any of that, i'd rather ...
who is that? the announcer. do i know him?
wait. i have mr. grocer for you.
i don't know what's keeping me.  i should've been here a long time ago. now how about my proposition?
what's on your mind, lieutenant?
how.
how's your hip?
no one comes here after dark.
she's gone, leon.
that don't do us any good.
no, really.
never trust a nigger.
no, really, i liked it...thought it was great.
what's that?
knock it off!
i think it's time discuss your career path. have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
i'm at a payphone in vegas.  what's up?
bill, would you have the torrances' things brought in their apartment.
why not patrol?  they'd do just as good a job.
i liked it a lot.
yes, i agree, i think so too.
it's no use.  we'll never get away with it, joe.
it's my fault. i programmed you to want so much...
maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
you need a lift. let's go to arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... logan-6.
it's gonna be fine.
alternate lz zulu sierra at 0500. it says "may have heat.  don't be late.  all our love."
it's all right, george.  it's cool. just wait here, all right?  i'll be back in a coupla minutes.
honey!
whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
down front as always.
what the --!
who?
i'm afraid he's been stalling.
i read. i study. because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. respect his body and his mind. quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
a paratrooper named ryan.  he's going home, if he's alive.
so. there we are.
uh, i don't have much money with me right now.
you need my help?
i commend him on his choice.
the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  this is called, "claudication,"  as a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms i'm sure you've encountered.
she was --
i shall call him diello.
great.  this is great.  the whole town knows.  just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
me and you are gonna have a talk.
why does she come to you?
that's for ga... ms. gayley.
what's his name?
yes -- she did.
are you kidding?  with how our lives are, if i start subdividing files, i'll be sunk.  i just kept all pg&e correspondence in one place.
didn't someone say he didn't speak good russian?
trevor i've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. this poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. so, i've been thinking, what about daisy?
yeah?
we're all here, and ready sir!
how often does this happen?
you're kidding.
dear old bert's settled everything.
my firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
keep it.
i really like you too...
dorota.
oh, now i'm a bad housekeeper!
you know me, always taking on too much.
what about keith?
early night for you, isn't it?
do you have a motel or something? money?
i thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
there was a bang.
they are live ones?
i sure like the way he talks. it sounds like a race car motor idlin'. it makes me not be nervous.
what you want to watch this trash for? ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
you don't have to have a license to work in a casino. all you gotta do is apply for one. the state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. they got a ten-year backlog.
but... but, why?
hey, you alright?
i never....
your honor, may i approach the bench?
well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but i ha--i have to try.
anybody want another drink?
if the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  they'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
no death certificates. no crime.
don't you find that restful?... why didn't you come last night?
finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  if you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
okay.
then she's not as smart as i thought she was.  you've seen her in the depositions.  tell me you don't have any doubts?
oh dear, i didn't really mean to...
died in childbirth, having me...
mom, do you want some time with dad?
'i' will tell you what is boring.  once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  what's on the third floor?
homer, don't you know what business you in? you don't wanna go into no business with me, homer--ain't that right?
yes sir. two tours.
what happened to you?
my god, mr. fairlane, you look like the fall of saigon.
this way lex.
your mother? jesus, miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
here we come at last, my lord!
that's the boy.
chilton? gruesome, isn't he? he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test. hah. sat there waiting for mf-13 to come up. it's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. i laughed in his face.  never mind, it's boring.
i'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....a weekly thing.
uh-huh.
ever think of moving there full time?
as long as they keep overpaying me, i'll keep overpaying you.  ) just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
how long you have this detail?
isn't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals?
what is it?
matthew, look at him. when i lived in roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. he was bigger than ten movie stars.  where's your white lincoln limo?
what's the plan?
do you know me?
hello mazel tov! a boojee boojee boojee boo...
i said no touching.
he's trying to form words.
i don't know.
and while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  you got to hand it to them.
yeah, plain scotch.
i couldn't make you see how i felt, charlie.  i just couldn't -  i couldn't go threw with singing again. you don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  that if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... they don't want you.  they just 0
i fitted a lock up there. on the inside.
seven.
really?
i'd come to the realization that everything i'd based my life on was false. and that my life had no meaning.
...not even a 'thank you'?
well we'd sure like to help you.
pleased to meet you, ma'am.  we found your trunk. were you doin' the driven'?
how immediate is immediately?
... chauncey... chauncey...
yes.
egypt is in my blood. my father was a famous explorer, he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian. my mother! who was quite an adventurer herself
would you hold this for me?
if i did, i wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
they're merely tools to disseminate information.
looks like you've been expanding your...
oh. you have to tell me that.
comrades... i'm out of the omelet.
we should be so lucky.
your breasts feel larger.
bring it in.
is that something you're "feeling?"
you're the only mr. lewis in this class.  if you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
i'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, i think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. i'm sure this cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...i'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
ow! i'll kick your butt!
what?
that's kingsley. old bastard hears us, i'm sure. he just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. i know. i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. literally. [beat] you're the cop killer, right?
we have achieved complete surprise!  the first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  we can launch a third wave, admiral.
well, i think it's charming, rose.  but don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
he seen you, tom! you wanta be fingerprinted? you wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am, he always makes me sound boring.
did he try to kiss you?
hey! that was a 3k machine.
this is not about money, emil.  i need your trust in me.
okay, barbie, let's get this over with.
alright. how about the master of disaster, huh?
not even a rhinoceros?
remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
where are you goin', karl? didn't you want some chicken and things?
are you sure they're home? did you call?
i work at an insurance place and at penny's, so cole can go to that good school.
cut round him for now.
i haven't had a crush since i was
not if we keep 'em here.  you can't kidnap somebody in their own house. it's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  or something like that, i'm pretty sure.
that would be stupid.
yeah. fitful dreams.
gee, it's easy.
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
you haven't eaten your lunch.
what are you talking about?
i didn't know what else to call you.
'functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
you're amazing.  you figured this all out already?
okay. three-twenty sycamore? . . .
what's the use?  the drawbridge is up!
well, general ripper, sir -- i was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
i couldn't have done it without you, charles.
you said you could keep up with her! 'no problem, nick-san.'
what's the idea?
he spoke to you?
oh, i suck. i suck.
i assume in my usual charming manner i've just insulted the host.  alexander knox.
he's the kind liked it.
you're not a monster, craig. just a confused man.
bright enough to be dangerous.
alright, we're going. we'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
yeah. it's my sister's.
we gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  i played a lot of poker in world war ii , and i won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  that redneck johnson left me with a shitty hand and i'm bluffing.  i've got to play the hawk in vietnam and the dove in china. and if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
is it night or day, erik?
you barely know them.
oh, do you like it?  i'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
i know, ma. i'm a tryin'. if it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. but it *ain't* the law. they're workin' away at our spirits. they're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. they're workin' on our decency.
i take it she read well.
well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
i have not said all. by malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar's plan. he hears only that juliet is dead. and thus he goes to the apothecary.
maybe i don't want you to.
just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
a jockey? you mean, like --
i thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
horses.
sit down, gino!
the fuck you talking about?
gee... that's wonderful, jill.
actually, no. adam was switching to a whole life policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his term life lapsed. so it's value is null and void.  now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
this one.
hello, inspector--i hear your vacation's been spoiled. somebody lost a bracelet.
freddy.
surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
... luke, you must not go.
just the face.
oh, well, then you better listen to him.
a trumpet?
m-m-m-ma'am?
you want me to try?
sensors show five life signs aboard the station, captain.
what do we do?
gosh, i could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. and you, batman -- you're the guest of honor!
should i distribute phasers to the ba'ku, sir...?
i love a macho façade. it's such a turn-on.  what smells like shoe polish?
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
i know what you want me to do!
i've been thinking about this.
can we come in?
yes?
pleased to meet you ... hi, bow's it going? pleased to meet you! hi, carl denham ... how's it going?
he probably knows a lot more than that. somebody's lying.
be careful.
i've thought about you.
"like a heartbeat/like a love beat." listen to the di franco twins there. just the plumbing or something, fool.
[yeah.  yes.]
i didn't see any point. dyle's dead.
i lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
they're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
they're from good stock on their mother's side.
you are. i joined up to get out on my own. and you had to tag along.
and what's that?
i thought i made myself perfectly clear.  you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it.
macbeth, right?
how'd it go?
for the love of god. not spanish again. who's the girl?
did she drown?  the woman you told me about?
let's go over it. where are you?
and thus unable to declare her love
merry christmas to you, sir...
kind or not kind. what's the difference? it always ends up the same way.
you planned this --
do you know a marie?
{winking at sam) she doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
i think we'll find what we're looking for at the cetacean institute in sausalito. two humpbacks called george and gracie.
you need my help...?  you need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    huh...?  are you nuts?  eh?  are you nuts. what are you going to do, bring her back to life?
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? i have to go.
sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister. is that true?
after you huffed off, grace lied so bad, i got so pissed off, i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. sorry i lost my cool like that. it's a funny thing, women.
what do you think of this one?
we could still talk, you know? it's nice to talk.
one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon, sir?
jesus christ, we're only going nine miles.  be there in two hours, tops!
uh...that baby’s crying...
half.
seemed...on edge.
well, does marcus have an alibi?
hi, andy.  how's the weather up there?
what... ?
oh, sorry -
we're your friends. we're not like the others.
i wanted to apologize for this morning.
as for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one. hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. i could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had i not been obstructed by a heart.
more of a game really.
you've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
who? who knew just where to hit us? and <u>why</u>?
c'mon, gang. let's focus. sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
<i>                                     ... birds of a feather.</i>
here's to huntin'.
what have you done to me?
regardless of how i may feel about ruby... our fates lie along different paths. nothing can change that.
what are you doing out here?
no way out.  no way out.  what?  who?
what?
you want him dead too.
he never would have believed a woman like you existed.
when i came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. i told you to turn off the tv when you were through.  come to think of it, i also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
heaven and hell?

do you have a good answer?
isn't there something you want to tell me?
yeah.
cb. little while ago. one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers. i figured you'd know what really happened. the fucking guy kill himself? this twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
i like it.  i like the idea.
did he buy it?
you don't have to. i told 'em you're real careful. you never pick up money yourself. you always send someone, and i never know who it is.
you found something?
i'll kill him!
all or nothing.  you want to roll them for me?
something's weird.
i was just wondering... nick... you're going hunting... if i could use this place to stay, because...

zorg. jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg... nice to see you again
and ask me what?
elle, i can't. you don't understand.
early, what're you doin'?
and when you came downstairs, what happened?
sure.
quite sure you had no motive?
i came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. i am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
all right, i drove to the beach. norma, you don't want me to feel i'm locked up in this house?
joanna, go fuck yourself!
he's a mess!
yeah, don't stop. keep going.

no but he got really weird. like i've never seen him act. really angry and super uptight.
i want them arrested and hanged!

the call i just made?  five minutes ago?
so what'll you do? after they give you the gold watch.
what's it look like i'm doing? i'm tuning a goddamn piano.
we, we were rather busy...
...yes potatoes... but...
stop it! just cut it out!
now what?
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
--millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  it'll just get everybody in trouble.
the butler said i could stay. i told him it was important.
we don't know that, do we?
do you?
i think we should have taken a right back there.
in the sub.  resetting the timer. why?
nothing.
well, i'm not.
wish i knew you better.
well, who have we here...?
i said knock it off! now as far as i'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
she used to tell me she'd turn me in.  little kid.  ten year old.  "if you're naughty, dad, i'll tell on ya."  she didn't want me sent down again, see. when i was planning some job.  "i'll tell 'em, dad, i promise i will.  here, look, i'm calling the old bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  i can see her, the phone in her hand.  became a sort of joke between us.  only it wasn't a joke.
"what we want is in that room."
don't have to call me 'sir' neither... nor grampaw neither...nor methuselah neither...i can whup you to a frazzle.
yeah.  with money like rockefeller, and shoulders like johnny weismuller -
it was great. there was always someone to play with, give you advice.
well, sure.  so would i.  so would you. i wouldn't worry about it.  we'll get it right one of these days.

as an unmuddied lake, fred. as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. you can rely on me, fred.
philip.
i don't know.
okay, i'm out of here!
not an easy day to forget.
what's that, a ship?
i don't know how you put up with him.
i think it's been a pleasure.
what about that family in '31?
's okay. what do you think?
stuttering stanley!
curse?
that's *it*?
these are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and hoover himself, putting the black panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the bureau.
this has nothing to do with you.
that musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
anybody take it?
right.  it's incredible how you do that.  remember things.
it was nothing.  we were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  terry and chuck were...hurt.  you were almost...  you were even cut.
okay.

i think i'll read a little.
after this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and i are going away.  just the two of us.  no dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. just you and me.
no--
i've considered that.
put the key in and turn it.  the right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
i'd rather piss glass.
so you're a one-girl guy?
holy-moly. these boys're a hit!
how is he?
so what did he say?
i don't care for him.
we thought it was just.

how are you?
i fear he may have to.
so whose car is it?
but you passed the test!
i don't need his life story. is he really that dangerous?
we want to talk to you.
retired. i'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
you've come to me. i wanted to believe you would one day.
your honor, i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
it has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  in that regard, i should thank you.
well, i'm done.  are you done?
and you want these girls to feel your pain?
theramin.
well, that's not entirely true, barnett. at least not according to haven.
sir?
you're going to break up with lisa, aren't you?
i realize your anger, jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  it's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
...tunnel!
wonderful!!... wonderful to see you, pete. how are you?
all i need is for you to check the name.
you're australian?
you dropped this.
mummy and i, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  then a couple of years after daddy died, and not long after i left oxford, she started seeing various men and i was furious.  i really was upset. i stopped going home.  i never phoned.  i went round telling everyone how awful her books were. and she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  then i got a job i was interested in, and i started to see lots of men, and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand.  so i wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry i was, and how i was worried that we were drifting apart.  and do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
yes, i do. i don't have amnesia. i remember everything about myself up until the incident. i'm leonard shelby, i'm from san fran -
is this mine?
not, "eternity forever"?  the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  i'd kill for that part.

it wasn't tom that broke in the room.

it was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
pretty amazing girl, you've got. make that kind of sacrifice.
what happens if i'm convicted of kirsty's murder?
you don't know the real me.
how fast?
albatross?  doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
nick...
bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
thanks.
what???
what's all that gunfire?
okay, quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-suddenly we hear a pistol blast and quellek's chest turns red. alexander and quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
the stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. do you know what i mean? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake.  but i've had nothing but time to think about it. it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. but we've got to get the money, baby.  we get the money, i get the car, then we get the hell out.
i think we should go wake them up. just in case.
it was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
what happened, nick?  did you get sucked into it? did you like it too much?
cooper. bobby cooper. oh you know, whatever pays best. little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
in your present condition, alice, we're worried about your ability --
i'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
hardly anyone calls me tom. everybody calls me mack. i always liked that.
about what?
i'm a bad person.
doyle, once around the park.  i need a moment to prepare.
no.  are you really going to drink that stuff?
maroon?  whaddaya want?
you got her warmed?
most people are morons. i mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
no -- i'm not involved.  and i plan on keeping it that way.
what's this?
how the fuck did you know?
what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?
i'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. so far i haven't been able to find him.
why?
did the police contact you?
what time did you get to work today?
about twenty seconds in your time.
hello? yeah, baxter. what's up?
tell him i had to leave suddenly. i got a job in china - some place.
okay. which one do you want?
hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
johnny, the doctors explained --
where do you hail from?
that's that's that's that's beautiful...
what elders?
what is this place?
it's just a matter of time.
is it frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
when's the arraignment?
so!  sal is with you?
where am i?
that's ok, you'll figure it out.
knock it off, luke! you cain't talk about him that way.
i don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
it would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
the first fun's bound to be rough. it that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. but if the eeg flatlines, don't touch anything.
about jessica.
what the hell happened to you?
i won't tell you more about that. i'm more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you...
are they going to work here too?
quiet, mollie, quiet!
yeah, sure.  you got change?
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before you're too old like me. a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office.
hey, asshole. happy birthday.
our recon flight ?
closer?  i can try.
you're gonna be okay.
i don't know. i barely made it today.
aren't you going to say anything?
i've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
no.  i got lucky with the lights.
hello, grant. good to see you again.
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
work hard, be good at your job. sir. do whatever they tell you.
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway?
well, here we are, sitting in my chair. do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
old woman? chang told you that, didn't he?
this is permission to take her apart.
they'd die without each other.
in this obsolete little cyclotron, i'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century.  with more power, i could--
what? oh! i see! it's st. phillips. oh, of course. why... why that's very good, i mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
i've been ordered into bed.  the doctor says i've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
splendid! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. never.
tell me what you saw tonight. tell me.
my brother is gonna shit.
she own you, jimmy?
i wouldn't take no cheap shots. i'd be a good sparrin' partner.
hey, he's not sore, is he?
we're fucked.
he will... come on, git down and act like a possum.
you can be goddamn sure, though, i'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when i get back to baltimore--i get proof who stole my shit and i call the cops!
the money's right here! get the key!
it's okay, everything's okay now.
the more he thrashes, the better.
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much?
should i run him through?
he's an artist.  anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
i think so.
you're joking.
i can do it myself.
back to work.
do you dream often?
no deal.
will you sleep soundly tonight?
am i cool now?
how about a hippopotamus?
don't give him anything.
but if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  the deception is minor.
remember what madame sconce said. if you love him he'll be fine.
cool.
c'mon, champ. you look a little woozy, there.
when you figure on branding?
ma'am?
they really got all that money, them whores?
alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
three patrol ships are heading our way.
what is this, david?
what was all the banging?  were you fighting rats or the entire german army?
i thought that was it.
do you have a boyfriend?
did you know the victim?
so what the fuck were you thinking?
spooky.
uh huhh... band practice?  it's benny. he wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
yes, i understand.
forget it.
nothing. something i - forget it.
no!
you don't say.
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old. you had such a bright little face...
pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? so what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. and when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. and, we give you medicine, and you get better. huh? okay? you're better already, aren't you?
i don't get it -- you said your mission was to kill him. let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. this  kurtz is ruining the war; i mean, this don't look good for america !

i think he's ready.
i don't have a problem with that. it's up to annie.

roger, enough with the fucking donuts! what did i tell you. stop bothering mickey, and get behind your nagra.
what do you mean by haul?  what are you not telling me here?
i don't want it to taste different. i don't know why i bother. is that enough for you? hey!
spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
damn, porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. an incontrovertible motive. and definite footprints on jimmy looks twice at maisy blue legs house.
okay.  but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
but those are our dreams, son. we have to make them come true.

you get her those vitamin e right away.
and i love the inscription you wrote to me. only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am.
you told me you'd take me over to seattle today.

i love it.
get up, mister!  don't ever let it be said toby tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
oh shit...
we have to find out who else would profit from marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
take it easy, ruby...	it's all right.  now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton's throat?
since the last time we spoke? i don't know. could be better. could be worse.
well...?
then, why did you come?
maybe she wanted a free trip to la. maybe they offered her money. massey is very seductive. who knows.
thank god we're beginning at the beginning.
this night is too beautiful to have again.
-- just to clarify --
that's right.
can we make it?
nice guy. when we got to the bar...
queens, new york.
we've never met.
can you really see through anything?
well, hello.
but i mean, why do you need to steal?  couldn't you get a job?
i could teach you a thing or two now.
probably.  one of the many.
did you like it; me watching you?
personally, i'm type o.
then i demand an apology!
illusionists get. las vegas contracts, d'amour.  magicians get burned.
they don't belong to anybody.
helen.  i saw him die.  i saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
i ... mexico.  you got a bus that goes to mexico?  that's where i have to go.
someone’s trying to kill me. i need the police.
and let's forget about the high hide. we can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
don't ask where i got it.
oh, yeah, yeah.  how old is she now?
where is she?
i got here as fast as i could. where's cathy?
king of the housecalls! master of the living room!
i'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
we might be innarested.
sir?
don't remind me.
remember, a jedi's strength flows from the force.  but beware.  anger, fear, aggression. the dark side are they.  once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
yeah.
who?
well... you're walking me home.  i... i guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
well, don't ask me to.
great story, isn't it?
business.
six onion bajees!  great girl.  did you shake the mother off?
yes i can, marcie.  and until you start givin' me some straight answers: i'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
affirmative, arctic warrior. what type of vessel?
where'd you learn s.o.s.?
what do i believe it?  are you kidding me?  what do you think?  i'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real, wasn't.  the whole world, my entire life was a lie.  i don't know anything anymore, morpheus.
of course i do -- i never knew what money really meant till i started spending it. do you know --  i can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from preysing -- i'll take care of you. will -- will you let me?
why not -- ?
yeah.  we all got caught.  shoplifting. cuttin' school.  cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  so we gotta come here.  so we'll be good, in the future.  so we'll learn valuable lessons.  and i learned mine.  i will be incredibly good, i will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  can i go now?
nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
we don't know.  whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
kate’s on two, jack.  nice ride...
leave him alone.
yes! it is! the paper's cheap, the type's too small --
why's that?
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you, mr. robinson. i am trying to tell you i do not resent you.
...you're dealin' with!
i was always jealous web mimms got to go off and fight with you and cole. now it's my turn.
hey blaine, did i leave my... holy shit.
so are you. you've got a vision.
are we?
we make a deal or i come out and hand this phone to mickey.
... and what... what did he say?
thank you.
i'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
no one would blame me if i left!
yeah?
what's down there?
what?
well, sure.
how do you know?
where are you going?
...it is?
that's your funeral. we've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
no.
uhhh, va, uhh, vada.
i'm still here.
i think i can find my own way back to into town.
all right then, i'll see y'all later. karl you done a good day's work. they right about you. scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. i'll see you tomorrow.
you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
all right, grace.  no more games.
he already knew it.
al?  al, you there?
here comes the resume.
...i know you're down, but you know when you're down, drew, there's no place to go but up.
over three hundred miles.
well ... yes. all right. but -
young man, this faberge egg is chipped.
nope. the switchboard is lightning up downtown. kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. it's turning into woodstock except there's no concert.
mr.-  taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
you got it.  operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and i'm the punchline.  i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower, but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower.
they certainly are.  whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
how do you like your coffee? black?
who are you?
i'm the victim here.
i'll give notice.
it's just that darren and lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
your daughter is much too hard to impress, ruth.  mind your step.
not once.  what's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? it's really more fun.
bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class.
if it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  what do you think?
he is exhausted.
kip took a job. fifty ladies in two weeks. only the two weeks have turned into four days. and not a single lady has been snared.
i did.
put the fucking kettle down.
there is always a way! but you are such a... a glotzkopp you cannot see! you'd rather go back to that city! to nothing! no woman! no children! no land!
yeah, we're all above that.
it's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
i kissed him, kit.  on the mouth.
well, i'm not smoking, okay?
do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
beautiful day, isn't it?
prouder of this, than anything i ever did in my life. i want to thank you, ron.  want to thank you.
but it'll stop the movie.
i hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
what kind of coffee do you like?
what's wrong?
but it ain't runnin' away, ma. all i wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
make it official, if you like.
aye.  it is his duty.  all of ours.
no, it's true.  i have lung cancer.
that's it...  herbert macaulay.
--no--
right.
that's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
i'm in till the end.
what about us?
i was wrong.
you cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
just promise you'll love me even if i end up in a job where i have to wear a blue polyester cap.
keep your voices down. this is a respectable establishment. we don't go for any funny business here. just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
donít kill me!
that's very simple. i was home.
kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
the one on the other side is letting men in.
i scoured the city for it.
nine-thirty, ten maybe.
were you in the men's room at the edmonson drive in flea market on saturday, september 19th?
sure.
now ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
come on. you're fucking hungover.
do you get paid a lot?
magua slept hard in the english wigwams.  and the sticks left their mark...  magua's village and lodges were burnt. magua's children were killed by the english.  magua was taken as a slave by the mohawks who fought for the grey hair. magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. the grey hair was the father of all this.  in time magua became blood-brother to mohawk to become free. in his heart he always was huron.  and his heart will be whole again on the day when the grey hair and all his seed are dead!
like how'd you get this car? that suit?
they never hurt me? they hurt me every day with their attitude. you know, like they even have a right. who the fuck do they think they are? let me tell you something, i was born here. alright? i'm an american. and i'm owed something. look, they took it from me.
did you like proteus or valentine best? proteus for speaking, valentine for looks.
lechter's not buying up his memorabilia. he keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
how long does this go on?
eight-thirty.
very ugly.
why don't you have more time?
a long time ago...
and i have a special feeling too, because i do. it's special.
i thought i was fucked up.
you do?  over here?  on <u>my</u> side?
i won't.
listen, you're right.  don't do it. i'll just... send you an address, okay?
rich.  reclusive.  bankrolls half a dozen charities.
lord cornwallis is brilliant.  his weakness is that he knows it.
the food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, cole?  to that "dying" world'
sure.  why?
no. i think you're a moron and i don't want to get into trouble.
do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
yeah.
bravo!  bravo!  magnifico!
you know.
yes. please. i want you to.
not much, actually. my software company just went public so i'm just... hanging out, really.
take it,easy, boy...  seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but i'd say you knew exactly what you want.
mary, people come to him voluntarily.
did you want it to come out?
wanna know what i think?
wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
tell me, m'sieu laval, what else is wrong?
you've what?
no.  i don't scare easy.
do you have another tie?  something more conservative?
and besides, i thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
it's alright.
i saw them kill him!
there must be something.
your teeth are straight.
no, i'm paying for the dress.  do you think she's still gonna run?
i wish it could all have been different.
i was twelve.  nix took me hostage, to get swann to come to him.
none either.  it's bizarre.  it's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out.  nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63.  a man who has defected once already.  it's crazy.
what's this?  what's going on?
i'm supposed to call in.
nothin', morty, it's my lunch hour, i thought i'd drop by and see who died lately.
yeah, i understand, tommy.
excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
hey, tammy, guess what happened today.
the indian rope-trick.
she tarried around the kitchen after i'd gone up, and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong...
i'll pay it back to you saturday - on the level i will. give a guy a break, will you? i've got to get it back in my account. if helen ever finds out that i—
let's get serious...
i don't know what to tell you, sir. he's been gone this whole week.
i won't tell you what came between... i'll prove it. it will take a long time, ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
it's hard to describe. i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
going to turley, was it?
wait -- hilary clinton.
i can't.
that's because dr. zaius realizes our work has value.
a man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at fort holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
i wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
what?
resetting the sub.
what do you need it for? i don't get you lately.
that’s when i realized i wanted to be a doctor.
please be quiet -- oh please, pearl!
richard, shut it and keep it down.
that's some terrible shit.
let's go.
we're taking a different way home.
you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  you are open and easy now... it took you a lot of work to get to that...
what?
i'm saying that since i'm doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- i'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
don't talk.
well, isn't that nice? you just go right ahead and putter with your hands. that's all right. how do you do it?
hey? you like to walk.
hey... the fuse.
glad to meet you.
right!  you're right.  i have to fix this.
about a quarter to one.
call me jake. careful driving home, curly.
you're no good for this business. it's just a joke to you...
uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard enterprise with my officers as guests of the united federation of planets?
martha louise livingston.
because i didn't have it. ray, i swear, melanie came in and grabbed it.  and someone killed her for it.
you have to do something for me first.
you'd better tell the captain. we've got to land as soon as we can. this woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
i beg your pardon?
just that i was in the marines.
i'll tell you how. like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. how you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
no.
you what?!  how did you do that?
fuck her yet?
calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
i'm not gonna kill it.
meredith logue. you were kissing somebody. looked like meredith.
moved on to plumbing huh?
well?
my god, austin, what have you done?
sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  maybe you don't appreciate that.
ain't it the truth. must be good to be rich.
do you know what this is?
nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  there was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. anyway, when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution.
that must be it.
my god.
leave her out of this.
we have more in common than you think, wendy dear. i loved summer camp when i was young and i love it now. it's important. between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who i once was...i get recharged. now who's the dork?
you look better than veronica lake.  now, <u>pierce patchett</u>.
look, you fit the profile exactly.  thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  you start thinking...this isn’t the life i dreamt about.  where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  suddenly, every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger represents a life you can’t have...
i'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
well, let's say i live in it. such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
annie... annie may have made other plans. i'll have to see. besides, i can find my own way.
get the chalk.  get the chalk...get the chalk!  i closed 'em!  i closed the cocksucker.  get the chalk and put me on the board.  i'm going to hawaii!  put me on the cadillac board, williamson!  pick up the fuckin' chalk.  eight units. mountain view...
oh, he's fine.  he's-he's, i guess he's fine.  i don't know.  he's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
ricky?  where...what...
yes, sir.
what're you talking about, george?
you're not very ambitious, are you?
not no more.
the ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
according to dr. darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  q.e.d.
dennis leary.
what the fuck are you doing?
bad company...
andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  they might change the channel.
sure is hot today. think it'll rain later?
full clip to the body --
look who you're asking here. how're we gonna block off the street?
aren't you going to thank me?
i rock a harmony.
cut the horseplay, harry. what's the matter with you guys?
yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
m- uh, mr. and mrs. rothstein?
not quite...quarter cherokee. the rest is welsh...so they tell me.
one of the seven natural wonders of the world.
i bought it at a store in l.a.
what?
...without compunction.
thank you.
just seemed like the right move... whatcha doing?
hi...
no.
death! thank you!
it can buy you a new and better you.
could this be that boy?
whatever! it's no dig on you, archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- the allemeinischer zeitung, le figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
your old man thinks i did it, don't he?
that you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
you waved to me in the elevator.
hello. john triplette.
but you won't listen.  you won't see me, you won't see anyone.  what would you like me to tell jamie? that uncle alex is busy?  that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
weren't those a birthday present from dr. mccoy?
so wadda you do with your girls?
the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. jack and i can get off safely. both of us.
huh?  well, you know what? now, i want you to tell me. i mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. i mean, what do you want? do you want a coat?
pod bay is decompressed. all doors are secure. you are free to open pod bay doors.
who are you?  why is the green destiny in your possession?
that's terrible!
who are they?
you defend yourself admirably...
goddammit, hardy, you can't just leave --
well, it's on! we're gonna rock. linda, call vaughan. tell him to get over here. i'd like him to be here. i owe him a good time.
jacques, my friend, how are you?
fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. your avoidance mocks me.
no, no...
what d'you wanna ask, mr ross?
yes.
he's gotta know by now that i gave him up back at glades.  he does, he's gonna try to find me.  maybe go see adele, see what she knows.
yeah.
[the one who transferred pinta to their car.]
she's like a different person. being so sick made a big impression on her. i really think she's learned a lesson.
i met your friend mary.  she said i should stop and see if you were okay. apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in montreal. cabot, north of laurier.  bonjour.
and the lord told that man --
uncle, 'tis a shame.
what are you going to do?
please take us to the beach where we landed.
did you love it?
i want you to get out of here, norbert.  harold--i want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until norbert is gone.
who you are --
i guess so. you want to help me watch frank?. i'm going to stake out frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
ever talk to him?
but why talk about robbery on a night like this?
thanks for everything, pro.
well, rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was mrs. hillyer's, and so was the children's. how about you? was your sleep disturbed, too?
well, she's running now, too. these fucking people like to run, don't --
give me the district attorney's office.  i'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the state penitentiary.  hello, d'arrasty! this is hartwell. come over to my office, will you? i've just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions.
do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
i want this room sealed. the second containment is off limits.
there is no world without verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. then banished is death mis-termed. calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
if we find ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b.a.r. back to the beach for me.
let's relax tonight, just the two of us. i'll make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
good evening.
what do you mean, general?
well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
come on, terry, we got a ride!
i don't know. later. i don't know.
no.
you want to go for a ride?
you want a wip-it?
he's about to.
just a minute. i'll pour you some coffee.
you called the cops on us?
walter!
how do they know it's over?
and you never defend me. you're afraid of her.
there's a man downstairs.  he brought us eggs.  he might stay.
do you always walk around with a sword?
no, i touched me.
here's the patrol.
how did you, know the rest? i never taught you the rest of it.
and i was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
i know you do. but it is different.  it's different.  we'll be all right tomorrow.
and ryan works at home.
okay, well here's yours...  "who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? not this one! stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
yes!
because he dated her.
hang on, sir... nine point seven... point eight... breakaway threshold...
huh?  oh.  yeah.  tape deck.  couple of creedence tapes.  and there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
well, i don't want to brag, but i've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- i just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
hey mister. mister, i just... i just wanted to thank you.
harmless - how?
think we can fit up in there?
probably as close to the getty as i'll ever come.  unless you care to be my "patron," nels.  you wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
i'd believe him.
there's a spider in my room.
ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! i'll...i'll... what will i do?  i'll build in a counter-punch! anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! and wiped out!
killaine's wise.  we can't wait any longer.  here, put this on.  but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  i'll tell you when. 
eddie, which dress do you like better?
through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
you're always taking time off....
pig.  what the hell happened this time?
i'll go and get my valise.
evening gown?
fine.
sure i do. i understand he's in the hospital. how is he?
how much wine have you had?
i'm busy.
and she had private investigators assisting her.
i don't know, grady. i just dropped him on a corner.
i don't know how.  because he's different than we are.  because he's a space guy.  what do you want from me, anyway.  go ask blair.
she fucked you?
shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  cronkite's sticking it to me. it's their first big hit on richard nixon.
you can't use that until neo is out!
209 to anyone! i need some help here!
you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say . . .
that’s totally see through...
you can't testify.
yes.  i shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  i will blanket the city in endless winter. first gotham and then the world.
we have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
ow, let go, butt-head!
well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, mister mcmurphy. i'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. so, i'd like your cooperation!
no!  no police.  they'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  they'll kill us. we've seen their faces.
mozart, are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
halina?
would you like to come in?
that's very kind of you, but i'll bet it's not altogether true.
so i guess this fellow belongs to you.  what's his name?
just in time.
you don't have to talk about it.
is that the man i knew, treasurer sanchez?
i wouldn't worry.  so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you, the skipper, dave, kent, sir ian and my father -
it's a beautiful day in tuscarora - i don't envy you that humidity in the city.
this had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
of course.
it's not what you think.
does he stay with you here?
cunt.
“well rewarded” those were his words.
when did you start drinking coffee?
well, when you put it that way.
agreed.  you have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
no, i have to work.
which way?
great.  they'll have a parade in your honor.  you'll be man of the year in seattle magazine.  tira misu.
i know, by computers.
tom?
you're kidding --
is this normal?
it's an apartment.
i'm not that good at 'no,' liza.
you're okay with this?
boys marching.  clapping in unison.
behind my house, up on the ridge.
no further questions.
change the channel!
i've been a soldier too.  there is a difference.  a policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
when you won that scholarship, i was proud of you.
p.e.t.n ...
you know those little dogs you see people with?
what?
they ought to be.
from now on you'll be history
james dean, humphrey bogart...
okay, but...
romulan ale! bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
what does it say?
yes i do. did you ever think that maybe i could help you? that maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
i don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
do you want know the real reason why i became a bounty hunter?
i know him well enough?
the flower.  bluebells.  to hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
we did a little digging on jim trudell at sergeant zydowski's request. he's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
i never asked for more.
excuse me?
don't die on me, jerry.  okay?
why are you here?
a pleasure to torment me?
i was sent here by my country to fight you.
i don't like dancing.
are you a close friend of haven's?
take this back with you.  deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal.
sweet jack.  i'm so sorry you found me asleep.  don't know what came over me.
where's the stereo?
what do you say we send a bottle over?
about a dozen.
i think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
don't be so bloody naïve.  you know there's a war breaking out.  this arrived this morning.  by order of the british government - all international expeditions to be aborted by may 1939.
-- fezzik, please --
i am not!
yes.
are you guys' friends?
we've got another one.
red sox... who's on the mound?
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
cut it out.
no, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
i trust...  want to see what i trust... in god we trust...  the word's on every bill!!!
iím sorry...
it's the truth, jake.
yes.
impossible? what do you say, jones? ready to go down in history?
you don't seem afraid of much.
what?
son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. my hand is too weak. and would you do me another favor? i don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? i have trouble bending over.
i tell mine that they're little men. i tell them they're strong. they make me feel joy. i let 'em know. so they really know that i need them just as much. you know. just as much man. and you know, you're their godfather...
you see what i see, bork?
are you breaking the contract?
what i have to say must be said to all concerned.  it is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
i don't remember.
i'm supposed to be mad at you, but i'm not.
this isn't a game.
seymour! hello! what are you doing here?
you said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to max.
why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
you boys been hitting the pipe?
watts?
you were seen parking your car. the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him. lucky for you i waited.
good to be aboard, gentlemen.
aunt may, you're trespassing.
my monsters?
okay, okay -- stand over there....
i don't know what you're talking about.
outstanding.  then all we need's a deck of cards.  all right, let's move like we got a purpose.
it came yesterday.  i haven't opened it yet.
the real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  what took you?
where's he at?
hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
it's beautiful.  i always enjoyed models as a boy.  the exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
this eleanor's been living at the international towers for 3 years now.
maybe. at least i got to him.  where do we go from here?
oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "hey, i have something i just wrote," right?
it must be alright. he's still running around digging up tombs. besides, he's had experience.
now, where we goin', convict?
what's that? what's it called?
it's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
bomb?
chink's the guy's name, for christ's sake.
he sure is big, jack...
so you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. and of course, the mpaa didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. what did you think?
why did he shoot her?
why did you contact us?
and what did they say?
no, no, please. this fare's on me. please.
yes, i'm sure it is. that's what they say, anyway.
yeah.
308-9962.
guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
i was, yeah, i was thinking about going there for business --
hey, baby, say hello to felicia.
a tremor!
what happened to playing a hunch?
you've gone away from me, ro...  someplace i don't know how to get to.
it's just a game...! alright. candied diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance?
first things is, don't say, "what's going on?" everybody knows what's going on. i come into this situation, i say,  "i'm glad to see nobody's hurt. that's good. i'm here to help you."  second: you hesitated. don't hesitate. if you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. which you are. if he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. you don't want him nervous. got that?
yeah, but –
no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
is this yours? your pen?
systems register functional.
he's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my english is better.  this way... so you're from new york eh? i love those hill street blues...
the dixie cups?  oh my.  i was just a girl.  of course.  spring is here the sun will shine
stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. treat him right.
how big do the bears get?
fuck him.  great.  terrific.  fuck him.
you're not saying what i think you're saying.  i can't believe you're even thinking it.
damn, you got a stalker.
goodnight.
to tell you the truth, i'd just about given up waiting.
what?!!  since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
be ready for anything.
yeah.
i could try arlyn page again. she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel.
where were you? i went back to the myers house...
just...say...no.
no, will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  it's the truth.
i was looking for a pattern.
i might actually get the pasta special.
not here, duff.
hurry, hurry.
cool it.
you got a collar in here for the nightingale murders?
then we'd both have a miserable time. what do you think?
it's regular. okay?
it better be.
it matches the pictures.
the other two -- the new ones. where are they?
do you remember this?
you're playing games.
so who are these people with the boss ?
i had the christopher marlowe in my boat once.
you must come in first place to move on !
you didn't think i was rolling out of here naked!
he's got nothing to do with this. it's me you want, right?
fergus.
sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora, presently in the antarctic ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
what cheap shit... hey, waiter!
and you grew up in manhattan?
they're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. i got to know what they're gonna throw. you understand?
but you enjoyed it, yes?
i'm sorry.
make it thirty minutes.  what do you say, bud?
what did you say?
what did i do?  i spent thirty million dollars on you.  i spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  what did i do?  what in the name of god have you been doing, jason?
you...um...you never got married?
after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
can you identify this man?
i notice you're still working with polymers.
that's what he wants.
i couldn't believe it.  i was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  like if we could take a time-out...
denver is where he should be.
yeah, okay.
...i don't know.  tell her you had to see her.  tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. sweet talk the woman.  a young buck like you must be good at that.  then ... maybe shift the conversation.  get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  she loves that thing.  maybe the only thing she does love. she'll want to take you for a ride.
i know. i followed you. to the zoo, to her house, to your house...
with him?
wait a second. did you say "patricide?"
you need a glass?
they're taking your command, aren't they?
i've had worse.
how old am i?
her oxygen would have run out.
i want to see something!
i'll call the whole pot.
hey,... don't i know you?
masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. but his patience won't hold out much longer.
well, you know, however you want to put it -- i got your information from the publisher of the article. i called montana and your sister-in-law, i think, gave me this number.  i'm been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping you'd consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
no. just the coffee.
the sweep is just routine, not even police action.  i'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
the charades.
here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
you got salt last week.
in the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. but in the hands of your people--  we've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
oh? darrell taking good care of you?
it's a saying, mr. bernstein.  a new broom sweeps clean.
can i get some paper and something to write with.
excellent! stephen is my name. i'm the most wanted man on the emerald isle. except i'm not on the emerald isle of course, more's the pity.
what are you talking about, major?
no, of course not... i never killed anyone...
ooooooh.  hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. i've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. yes. that's the smartest thing you ever did, westley, not to contest that annulment. that's satisfactory, isn't it? yeah. well, it ought to be. oh i'm not complaining. it was dirt cheap.  don't fall out of any windows.
i doubt it. but it's something to do.
could be.
this don't look good.
okay, give us the women.
no, captain, please.
you get any sleep at all?
jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
well,  costello's finished with the stability profile, but abbott is still chewing on the load file.
how'd you know they were--
i *helped* you not to think about wally. you were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. this is how i helped you, right?
that's the second sentence you've started with "i" -
they might.  yes.  that's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  they're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   i'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  and every one of them it's written on their face, `this is a sham.  there is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'maybe...maybe...'
he's waiting for you.
what are you doing? you don't ever criticize the feature!
what is it, mary?
still playing by the rules.  you're a damn good kiler.
i'm a patriate.
jesus... take it easy.
fact of the matter - there never was!
go easy.
um... harry?  did i ever keep the books here?
twenty minutes?
there's ten grand in here. it's yours. i'm going to call you again. there's one more thing i need you to do.
that hair will have to go.
just goes to show you.
john....
fill this out.  will this be cash or credit card?
i don't know.
i mean morally. murray was my friend.
will you come home and forget all about him?
you're making a mistake, mr. deeds.
hi jody. what can i do for you?
why don't you tell me something for a change?
how what happens?
well, it doesn't make sense, nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
i'm done.
where the hell did you come from?
wing attack, plan-r.  that's exactly what it says.
[what's the pin number?]
jack daniels. don't worry, i'm paying for it.
and yet you started the engine right up.  with all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  did that strike you odd?
well now you do.
they're all dead.
we find an event that connects both families. same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  if we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
i'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
no....the asylum!
yeah, boss?
women?
valentine.  what's he got to say for himself?
elaine, not yet. i promise you i really can change.
good.  i hate to worry.  i got ulcers.
liquid gold.
how's the job coming, bob?
what about his first born?
linda... honey, what's wrong?
you must have a girlfriend.
who?
take your shot, kid -- you got money for trainin' expenses?
so?
stand up, john. let them see you.
what?
erin --
no, not at all.
you sure this is such a bright idea?
hadley --
you'd be surprised how many offers i didn't get. even brad wouldn't stick around for this.  it really isn't easy.
no. i didn't. i swear i didn't. i probably helped push you to kill yourself, but i didn't do it.
what's happening to you? what happened to your face?
so what's up with you?
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
no one met her?
dave...
don't tell al. he doesn't know.
mr rothstein is being very typical to this point.
don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  you don't want to look shifty, do you?
did you know mr. lime well?
you and me both. sal-va-to-re.
dad?  about last night?
well how do we look?
it's under your seat.
well, they're all excellent reasons.
i'll live.
okay?
i don't think you would. no matter what form you take.
you were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
it ain't nothin', don't fret it.  she don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
these are private -- these are for us.
it's a new experience for me.
if you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on earth.
you see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? you're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! gonna come in here and tell me! talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. shit! your ass must be crazy.  i don't think that white boy's got good sense. hey, marty.  he must of thought it was white boy day. it ain't white boy day, is it?
timezit?
you never walked away dad. you could have walked away.
when?
me?  i've never been better. i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
don't worry about jaeger.  he uses his personality as a form of birth control.
you murdered that girl, eddie.  six years ago...
which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  one for each person...over a hundred at least.
n-n-n-n-no, no, i du-du-du-didn't, i didn't!
yeah, they're great. sporty. they're really sporty.
we can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
do it now.
with what?  he doesn't have a weapon.
but you must.  it's the only way.
i don't know...
you were gone for a while.
look at those odds - ten to one. if he wins, we can pay everybody.
well, it's not unusual in his case... sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. the brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. a person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. are you relatives?  well, it doesn't matter. we'll take care of it. he'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
don't be such a baby.
your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
you were attacked in the forest?
mission accomplished.
no.
here. it looks like you need a refill.
maybe we should just leave --
did you get married real young?
know something? you're a workaholic. a good guy 24 hours a day. stop and smell the roses sometime. take up a hobby. get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
you told charlie to lay down and die. will you say that to me too?  what happens, eddie?
i bumped into him after you dropped me off last night. i didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
i don't have to but i find it natural.
what'd you do?
what?
what happened to your hair?
i know, i kind of blend in here.
the wilder paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.
so the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
are you and simone...  ... getting married?
i never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  no, no, no.  that's not what i wrote to you.
something big's going down, and i'm betting the feds don't know about it. you gotta get us in there.
i don't know, dad.  but it was big.
i think i've seen this nut somewhere.  haven't i?
having two pints in the rock.
i knew this man. green berets, out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here? you got any answers for this, dillon?
go ahead. stun me.
...we get our hands on him?
get your gear on.
look, it's not your fault, okay? it's me.  it's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
do you go to school?
well, maybe that's it. i'm chicken.
they are awaiting further information.
recommendations?
that could be a serious accusation, rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
why can't you look at him?
when will his trial be?
from the mission...
mr. hillyer, i know it was bad and i hadn't ought to of done it. but i'm only a human girl and i... i ain't always perfect. i promise i won't let him in the house no more, i promise. won't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me?
i like to work. i don't mind work. it's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me.  you're so sweet. there never was nobody like you.
oh god -- i can just imagine -- if only dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? never! i swear on your ring, marge. i am never going back.
it's her, isn't it?
my lady friend has a personality disorder.
you buy this "blurry" business?
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
yes. i know.
don't be offended, major.  our president holds the same views.
when i first showed up, i thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
ronnie, i'm still a virgin.
i don't think so. their fix gave us the heads up and jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
oh come off it, mare. what about what's-his-name... steverino? you could've at least passed the baton on that one.
i suppose it isn't logically impossible.
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you. tragic, a public outcry, but a number. one more dead.
when she was a tiny girl? and people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? she never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? she always said --  "when i grow up, i want to be divorced."
what's that supposed to mean?
your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
don't whisper it. don't even think it
but charlie – why me? why –
the genetic material you spliced into nomak --  where did you get it?
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman?
you got your dp?
why not?
you got no idee.  people there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. nothing the same.  in my countlee i bling good luck.  makee lain and thunder.
we had done time together already.
that's impossible.  i'm a doctor, i'm --
well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
who are you?
i'll talk to conrad myself.  i'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
the thin... the girl with small eyes. the one in your cupboard.
how did you know it was her?
i told you the facts! he abandoned us -- those are the facts.
yeah, i've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  right?  and sam.  believe me, suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  he's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  stay strong and he can't do shit.
doc -- something you said the other day --
oh, you american?
jesse, are you awake?
told that's what our old man was. planned on going to sea, me and bob, 'til i read jack london. started trapping when i was ten. mailed the furs to sears.  eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  that was fine money.
trubshaw again? what now?
beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, randall. i'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. so save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. the only reason i ride with you, is cause i don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
where did you get those from, a museum?
am i fired? you wanna hit me? what?
tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
it's not going to be forever. i figure three years is long enough. i can see it the music pans out.  and right after graduation we should start seeing other people. kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. know what i mean?
but we accomplish the mission.
i think he wanted you to tip him.
i just got off the phone with the cops.  they called to check you brought the cab in...
it's sand.
wow!  does this pole still work?
yeah in the trunk of my squad.
so josh, will you give us a ride? please? pretty please? it's going to be super fun!
here you are, sugar.
four!
caesar's mafia, isn't he?
oh my god...  hello.
u-huh.
you look a little shaken.
i know. i'm sorry...
turn 'em up.
yours was fully illustrated, honey.
yeah? but look at you.
cancel? but it's her birthday -- i already ordered the cake --
...which one are you?...
we must run in different directions!
yes, very much so.
outside!
oh, nothing's wrong. just... well don't you have your period?
don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
cypher?
follow me.
how are you?
jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
me?  well, i was wrapped in seaweed. it itched for a while, but i survived.  beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  then jellyfish?
what the hell is that?
what happened?
awfully short notice..
well, sir, i was just...
you never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
he's up with your father.
are you kidding...  i'm staying with you --
diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
rita... i want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
why are you picking on me for?
yeah.
vulcan?
and? what did you notice?
we're leaving in three hours.
what frequency ?
edward... you got it!
tedious. i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
i know you, hildy, and i know what it would mean. it would kill you.
you must leave.  you were not here this morning.
i'm so ashamed. why didn't you just let me die?
talk to him.
wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. that's why i need you, case. you're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. my "ice" as you call it. i'm doing everything i can to make that possible.
yeah, except fall down. that's right.
i can wait. where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night...
dewey my god i thought you were dead.
by 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  more, with this wind.
no.
i can't take you out of here in your condition...
one more after this, then i'm going home.
impossible.
i see it.
presence.
you'll get awful mad, john. i done a sin!
all padding.  don't let it fool you.
hi.
my apologies.  i had no business snapping at you.
what?
connecticut.
but, we're all going to heaven!
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands?  is it not so?
but it must have been wynant.  i should have known if it weren't his voice.
you have a man near it?
they said you'd be here.
my grandmother's rich.
help! help! i'm drowning!
let me guess, plant girl? vine lady? ms. moss?
sir:
okay? goodbye.
some. it's been slow --
so they tell me.  not soon enough, of course.  how are you, sal?  you look fantastic. it changes your life, you know.  a baby. it puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  doesn't it, mac?  you can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
that boy's got talent.
i'll drive her to the hospital.
are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
today...with dejesus.  that was smart thinking to get him inside...
well, well. all my family together again. how very sweet.
unh... unh man... i don't take no money from friends that need help. fuck no. what do you think i am a bum?
erin!
he's probably very tired. you see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
do you know this young man, mrs. halligan?
they're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, gabe.
watching television in color.
this came for you today. i presume on your request.
you can let him out on bail, can't you?
do you think they would cheat?
listen, what i'm about to tell you, i'm telling you in confidence, okay?  have you ever heard of a company called big.com?
why?!
petty thief, six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary, 1937.
it's my fucking life.
but tell me why ...
moishe martinsburg, mr. president.
i've got just the place for a man like you but i'm too busy right now to do any digging.  what do you call your dog when you want him?
proud?
you want me to put it all in writing? over my signature?
what's the fuss? i don't get it.
no.
we've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
case... are you alright?
less than thirty minutes.
no!
why are you here?  hmmmmmmmm!!!! ok.
before you start picking your nose, i know he put you up to it.
that's a lollipop that, boy.  the kid is only great.
i did.
you can't <u>do</u> that, i won't <u>let</u> you!
oh, it was...  really weird. but she's a very nice woman.
they'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
that's what you think.  okay...truth... i'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd century. i've been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
i messed up, okay, i know that.  but i ain't that kid's father.
don't you even miss me? didn't i mean anything to you?
i don't know what you're talking about.
you'll be getting me sad next.
man oh man.
we're losing our favorite teacher.
geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
mr. dawson, i --
sock it to 'em, kid!
what do you think i said?
have you ever seen annie hall?
halfdan the black.
no way.
donovan asked to see you before you leave.
yeah... pete the english.
it's a plastic, yeah.
i'm glad you're here.
we've got sixteen dollars.
twisted?
yeah.  but when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. the fabric tears.
didn't we play this scene before?
...yeah...
i'm sure it is, frank:  and let me tell you something.  if we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   see my point?  let's talk a minute. frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
i'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now.
you can't take that.
for your information, mr lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself. though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
do you want to know what he did? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  he handed the whole thing back to kross! on a silver platter.  for no reason!  what was he thinking, i mean, what was going through his goddam head?  why?  what was all that benevolent crap?  what are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  i'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
no kiddin'. what's your idea?
ghosts.
read her thoughts.
ok. for one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
jud, this is crazy. it's going to be almost dark before we get back.
no, no, no, not at all.
great.
i'll lock him away for good.
i slept very well.
what did you mean:  i'm 'out?'
fuckin' kids at home!  here.  get the fuck out of here.
i don't... i... i can't remember...
esprit de corps --
well, i guess it's all good.
just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
they're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
goodnight bears.  goodnight chairs. goodnight kittens.  goodnight mittens. goodnight clocks.  and goodnight socks. goodnight little house.  and goodnight--
then i'm sure to get a brain --
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch. does that sound alright, mr. creasy?
of course, elaine. but as long as there's any question, better johnny should come back and clear his name.
look here, the mountain man. you're walker, right?
this is our oil from our estates?
oh.
but please, baron. we're not supposed to breathe a word of it. you won't tell anybody i told you?
it's not just the cable system.  it's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  it's everywhere.
hell, i was game!
hey, sal.
i wanted to give it all to the church.
take her to my house. my dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. do you have anything to put around her?
you didn't have to kill sophie.
cute waitresses?
but you don't hate him.
we thought you was all broken up about toothpick charlie.
what i'm saying is, is that the king ain't gonna care. see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy, if you ask me i think he's jealous.
did bobby give you that or is there someone new?
food, moron.
now danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
don't stop, nurse--i think i'm going to faint.
that isn't granite. if that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
meet me at the other location.
soran?
we don't have anything from the nurse association?
but i am not human. i am only -
it was not my intent --
so you're going to be a grandfather.
mom.
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon. i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
like some vile toadstool.
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm fucked on the board.  you.  you see how...i...  i can't...my mind must be in other places. 'cause i can't do any...
that sucks. heh heh. they need some shows about fire! change the channel.
forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! what takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
carla and i will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
it is not.
i'm not a bloody teenager okay, i told you i can't do that shit.
where do we go -- my place or yours?
stupid yourself.
what do you want me to say?  i'm in prison.  you should know.  you put me here.
sick of the sight of it!  well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? i was just about...
i guess you're right.
ah! my dulcet darling. tonight we marry. tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
beautiful specimen.
it pays.
how's it feel?
i'm sorry.
no, because there were others.  there were admirals.
hello jack.  you don’t have to stop singing on my account...
how does he tell you things?
how did it go today?
i feel for you, but we got an emergency here. it's a weekend of full moons.  everyone's called in sick. larry, veeber, stanley too. we need bodies out there. i had to put marcus on twelve young. you know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
i heard from stella you were trying to find jake. what happened to emmett?
...look at that. twin cities.  ids building, the big glass one.  tallest skyscraper in the midwest.  after the sears, uh, chicago...  you never been to minneapolis?
didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
elektra king?  are you insane?  this is her pipeline.
i was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
... that's great.
let me go...  michaelllllll...
to kill. the taste of blood in your mouth.
tom, this is our case.
sheena, queen of the jungle.
it was the lovely samuel johnson who also spoke of a fella "who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
my lord... what are your orders?
virgil?
did you get rid of mark?
there has been so much soul searching about this wigand, i've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
certainly, sir. how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
continued
huh!
got me out of trouble.
was he a good man?
he takes his work seriously.
great.  gotta go.  see you then.
like gang-busters. now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
what about your knocking off for lunch?
i mean tonight.
oh.
i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.
does phil know how you guys feel?
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break, i propose we have a party. tonight, my house.
you don't understand.  you have been chosen.
i guess so. like you said. it's a strange world.
got a map of the environs of the yakima indian reservation with your name on it. better bring a pole.
you fucking promised.
you're on, kid...i'll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left.  and i'll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right.
am i dreaming this?  are you a dream?
i'm so inclined.
what <i>is</i> this place?
the boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. we've interviewed everybody there.
why jack?
as always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  and you're right.  i've come to celebrate.  after thirty-two years as psychiatric administrator, guess who has been named smith's groves new chief of staff.
she is a good looking woman.
actually, it's mary brooks now.
fuck you.  i'm running this shit.  you talk to me.
haven't you forgotten something?
but i have to go back. i brought you here so you'd be safe. from her.
where is she?!
i refuse.
hey, mister!  can i see those guns?
what are you snickering about?
no.
we've got to see one to find out. is there any --
am i what they had in mind?
do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
yeah, i know.
i know what i'm doing and i know why i'm here!
-- all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
did you sleep well?
that's swell. but how about here?  ever worked for robert knox, emma dill, clarence speer, marian parsons, or jasper lamar crabb?
i mean your man trubshaw.  your bullet-proof waistcoat.  i thought you were just overdressed.
i'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
they'll lose because they're my team.
who is it?
he's not here.
and you didn't tell her?
...really? that's nice...are you lying?
everything, my friend. and you hope to be a great sculptor --  a great sculptor. look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
what do you do over at your bank, grant?
that's all beside the point. the concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
dieter!
more fun win battle?
and he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
there it is... in red and white! "springtime for hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  what's the matter with you?
every day.
sorry, miss. beer and ale only. canadian law.
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
no i don't know, luv, i'd taken my sleepers.
an outside person.  a foreigner.  a barbarian.  you, me.  more you.
why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
yeah, i heard a key slapping against my ass.
who are you?
depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
why would my father send this to me?
moses, moses seradungu.
you did? a human ear?
you better take off.
i command you.
it's not important, fran -- the main thing is that i got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, doc?
what do you want?
okay?
yero, by himself?
now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
rose?
as low as two.
i wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but i guess you are.
our baby's going to nationals! lincoln, alabama -- look out!
what's the matter, sweet pea. foley finally starting to get to you?
what sat mean exactly, everett?
didn't you say test the limits?
all you got to do is name it.
what you readin'?
this is all your clothes?
what?
dr. woodly.  i should make a little list.
then i'd say we should put jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. we'll get extra data this time. video... infrared... the works.
we should go soon. if dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
do you wish to be baptized?
no.
how can i go on? i feel so... responsible.
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
they are the same.
joe, i don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
what's the matter?
...mmm.
chloe?
i don't think she's real big on hate.
sorry, ma'am.
call me later.
jesus.
just some sketches.
i'm afraid some harm may come to her.
hey ! what are you doing here ?
you're getting' 10 cc's
stop it!  stop it, jimmy, or i'll leave right now.  i'm not kiddin'!
they're not usually graduate students.
hand rolled.
do you play?
you work too hard, pop.
i can't believe you just said that.
well, let me know when you figure it out.
did you see that, wendy?
cartwright.
and gaston, i was happier all day long. i felt i'd contributed something.
reverend edwards. philip edwards. you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
well, i'm no aviation specialist. but i do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
maybe it's better that way.
your manager?
please --
what's with the friggin numbers?
sure,  you're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
oh, it's wonderful.
will it lower the curve?
the point of what?
the crown is that of scotland. and scotland is william wallace.
a lady. she died.
it's not worth it, tom. he's surrendering.
did i urinate on your rug?
to do what?
come on, everybody!  we gotta run for those rocks over there!
yeah. it does.
well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
like what?  bank teller?  what do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  i got a wife and kids. i can't live on that -- you want to live on that?  what do you make a week?
peggy sue kelcher.  or, peggy bodell.  i'm not sure.
not even then. the police are the proper people to conduct this affair. now if you've got any suspicions i'll drive you to the nearest police station.
well, maybe it's like casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
thanks  oh, did you send that telegram to jim mason?
so, i hear the tart from california shot heyworth.
wait... wait... i already called him, i threw it away.
any damage?
i was worried.
look up, frank. full moon. the blood's gonna run tonight. i can feel it. our mission: to save lives.
can we get a t.v.?
no.  i came to talk about dr. john whittlesley.
saw what?
like what?
alchemy!  is the business term of the 90's, my man!  minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  i dumped some lira into research... shazam, we come across a diary by one of da vinci's apprentices detailing la machine de oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  money isn't everything, gold is.  fuck blue chip stocks!  fuck t-bills! fuck junk bonds!  i got the real deal!  money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
your report's become our bible down here, dr. johnson.  we've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
good.
and if you don't?
how'd you know?
only one thing to do, hank. drop the whole business quickly.
sure...get in!
well, come on!
it's not even yours.
the rest of you may hate your insomnia, but i find it the best time of the day for me.  i'm alone.  nobody's talking to me but myself.  my mind is racing with ideas, and i can think.
yeah?
flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  do you appreciate flowers?
i'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
now, listen. i'm in a very ugly mood. i put up a stiff battle for that seat. so if it's just the same to you—  scram.
she's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
yeah?
what in hell is that?
<u>jerry</u>?  you didn't show last night.  first time ever.  had me worried, boy.
you're staring at me.
that's the point, dickey.
a man to see you.
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
hmm?
mickey? he wouldn't do nothing like that. he's a jockey. they caught him doping a horse.
hold on, hold on, hold on:
fuck the machine.
would you let me make...a statue of you?
i have followed my feelings.
what the hell is that?
don’t get on that plane!
darling, it's good riddance. let her go. and while you're at it, fire that clark kent. he hasn't been here in days. he hasn't even called.
i want a martini! it's new year's eve and i want a martini!
you don't have to be.
hey.
yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
is that all?
shit.
i'm the clumsiest person in the world.
what are you doing, travis?
that oughta do it.
then who did??
fuck you. you owe it to me. tomorrow i'm gonna wake up and i'll be fifty and i'll still be doin' this. and that's all right 'cause i'm gonna make a run at it. but you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. and that's bullshit 'cause i'd do anything to have what you got! and so would any of these guys. it'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
i don't want to hear about it jackson.
pete, i've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
what-what? where you been the last four five years? outer space?
no.
what business is you in, homer?
how do you do, sir.
it goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, marty, i will have a new job. singing soprano with the vienna boys' choir.
selina?!  selina ... selina ...
your watch.
yeah, i guess.
what is it then?
if you're unhappy with the arrangement --
so you do drink?
would you care to look--in the telescope?
but this woman -- and her son --
would you like a drink? it's right beside you...
please drink your coffee.
home of the brave!
let me worry about that, major. i've still got my red line to the air command.
that's always your privilege, sir.
how are you doing?
yes?
shut up, yous guys. look, amber, i'm not gonna win. and let's be honest, a family only needs one "liza" and you know peter's got much better legs than me.
no, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
about ten minutes.
your letter came yesterday.
beth --
it was -- it was -- it changed shape. first it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
it's so small.
you could play the lead.
then what happened?
don't count it...it's all there.
...his number.
so we're gonna knock 'em both off?
is that --?
i see. and what do you do for a living, mr. fletch?
what you do is no business of mine. live and let live, i say.
it's not your roof anymore.
i had them in my pocket.
celebrate? what for?
man, this guy is really good.
it was our dream, too, buddy, together ... always.
right. here's eighty cents. send it.
for heaven's sake, bob, what's the matter with you? you went out there for the purpose of—
fancy a nibble?
appreciate something.
how ya gettin' out, mac?
i told you you wanted to take this call.
whoa, my life is cool!
what do you think it is?
none. can't find a thing. nothing on file, nothing online. it's not a part of any known killer's signature.
was dark... find a light...
oh, well, you know frederick.  one of his moods.  although it wasn't a bad week.  he  uh, sold a picture.
i think we said everything we needed to say.  maybe it's time to say things to someone else? someone close to you?
can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
richard, victor thinks i'm leaving with him. haven't you told him?
just want to say good luck.
'course how could you miss, right? twenty, maybe thirty feet. i mean, if i'd'a been where you guys were --
i'm not...
like this?
is he your boyfriend?
and that's what you were going to do in the valley?
'cause harlin used to own it.
i can put that together.
don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
thank you, handsome.
that's the good news?
he asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
this has nothing to do with your fire.
in your motorcycle example.  those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. rather than the reverse, yes?
uh-huh.
yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
like the look of these?  i made them myself, to set him free.
uh, selina, this is, uh, bruce wayne.
you are success story?  i am success story!  why do you say i and not we?
it's not the girl, jack.  sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  you may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
get him out of here?
i've been looking for you.  selina kyle was right. one of us is a psychotic crusader.
a boy kills his parents.  they have a plane.  he makes it look like an accident.
i've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate. after seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  the question is, what does charlie have to do with sid 6.7?
oh, somebody else sitting there?
maybe they didn't get here.  maybe they've been here.
i put it down the garbage disposal.
mama...
andy usually just sends those to the national media. the local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway.
is that what changed your mind?  the money?
we already know. all about it.
that can easily be arranged.
lord cornwallis will be with you presently.
what's this?
that's a good girl... i hate to see you so upset.  tell me, sweetheart. are you having problems with charlie? you mentioned something this morning.
the fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
good.  great.  yeah... wow.  rob gordon.  seems like a 100 million years ago now.
you really don't know who i am?
i...
just give me another chance, norville -- i can help you fight this thing. i know this last story was a lie! we can prove it! we can --
what is it?
yeah, air.
i'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first. that's when i knew the red sox were my team. pity and terror.
it's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
i'll wait... back there.
he's not responsive --
yeah. he's a nice guy. don't lose him. maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. it's a little...
do you understand what i'm trying to say?
let's get him out of here...
molly, dear molly. go to bed now, baby...
i'm talley.  who's in charge?
what are your plans?
i've already got more help than i need.
listen, what are you doing tonight?
not yet.
first of all, dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  you can't board it.  it gets upset, its hair falls out.
but when it comes out, the public will be outraged. it will look like germany all over again.
we have had fun, you and i. fun for a little boy in an old palace.
storm clouds are gathering, ted. it looks like rain and i don't have a thing to wear.
don't be scared, walter.
completely.
you haven't got the authority.  only pendergast can pull the plug.
christ, look at her. you'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  good evening, miss diamond.  you're late.
i'm not going  scotty, help me with this chute.
wait. slow down. a film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. it's like it doesn't even exist.
in case!!! the gun's in case!!!
you can fuck off, too.
say, aren't you charles palantine, the candidate?
what are you doing here?  you're not cleared for this area!
she okay?
chauncey, there you are. what are you doing on that leg?
i don't care about bucks.  i might love this guy.
these read as identical composition...  ... however, captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
do you know a clarence worley?
who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
the key, wade.
too little.
captain sparrow!  we have to get off this island -- immediately!
no.  no, i mean, i really don't know who i am.  i can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  i'm serious.
you don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
he is not himself -- but he lives. he is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
i know...i know you're the strongest cop in town.
with what?
what?
by the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
well ...
your ranch?
yes...i guess so. he was sleeping on the front porch when i left.
maybe she has.
i guess i ... if i jumped to...
do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
it's very good. i'm enjoying my visit with you very much. it's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. i'm sorry i made a spectacle of myself.
what do you want me to do? you want me to quit the show?!
when i first met marylin -- well, we were crazy about each other. not emotionally, of course. we just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
how're ya doin', max.
yeah.
max?  you men we're having company again?
so, adam...where on earth are you from?
you could have called me yourself.
he doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  what <i>i</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did foley hang around miami for so long?  any thoughts on that one?
i hear what you're saying, but i know what you're thinking.
what do you think?
well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what i can do.
no, listen to me. you gotta let me bring you in.
i'm sorry, there's no way we can.
as you wish.
clever fellow -- almost missed me.
the cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
what sort have you got?
i'm stuck.  the seat's got my feet!
would you excuse me? i think i'm going to go to bed.
no... where'd the tip come from?
you can hold back this months pay-check until i come through with the story.
why is she bringing that bag?
i'm taking over the center seat. i'm sorry, will.
you know what they make this stuff out of?
you were great. thanks alot.
you don't like where i live?
that whole time -- i couldn't stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier...
travis.
because it's not.
yes. like the quiche.
fine. more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
hadn't even opened the thing since cub scouts.
a year ? waiter another beer.
here.  the hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
is this your gun?
you--or the vancouver police department?
there'll be three, four men at the most.  i have some backup, nothing will happen.
i'm glad you're female.  do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
oh say -- elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday.
i don't know.
i'll give you anything you want, jake. i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
sit down -- we'll talk about it.
you did create me in your image, nathan. before you i was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. after you i became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. in a word, nathan, i became you. lila has reintroduced me to myself. and, incidentally, what i'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth. before when i killed, it was for food or in self-defense. now i will kill for revenge. revenge is an abstract concept, nathan. and i learned abstract thinking from you.
okay, you can't tell anybody.
come on, doit. doit. fill me up. come on, fill me up
there goes another scrub lady.
i'm kidding. i'd really love to, ted, but the thing is i already have plans. how about tomorrow night?
that would hardly be proper.
i've got numbers all over these - i'm not sure which is the one you want.
and a social life.
huh?
if you feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
you won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  you also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
you were talking in your sleep.
see. i told you there'd be a shaft.
she got one leg out from under him. now we had to lean.
mr. sayer...
what a beautiful day.
why didn't you go before we left?
we got engaged.
i think i need a little air.
steady, boy.  just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
yeah, i guess you are.
i was right. you are superman.
am i really so deeply repugnant?
i left my phone number in your undies. try not to lose it in traffic.
all right, then. here's the deal. total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
sorry it took me so long on the phone. but we're all set.
some cream?
yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. he loved that about you.
trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
does kat know?
what? did the politburo just one day say - "we give up?"
but that's a circular argument! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
wouldn't they normally be locked?
you meant that, but you meant the other, too.
maybe. but you're not putting any shit in me this time.
don't follow me.
i don't know.
that's right, buzz, and you know when i did it? last match, last frame. all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten, the fazeli split.
how would i know? i once bet a horse. he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
hey, man, is babe ruth in the lineup today?
what?
i am not here for revenge.  i am here to bring justice.
and not larry bird?  who's your favorite movie star?
really? no kidding.
he might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
oh no, no date.  bathroom incident.
how?
prepping your trip.
oh yeah, yeah i've driven by that place before. i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
but not everyone's imaginary, are they, mr. taransky?  i refer, of course, to edith.
show me again...
some kind of circuitry...?
hi. i'm inquiring ...well, i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive.
i won't be here when you get back, but i'll be in touch.  and thanks.
marcus!
i think.. i...i realized...i love you.
you know about the united nations?
how much is a shave and a haircut, roger?
that's not true, parker.
yes?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
are they hookin' you up with a job?
you some kind'a pervert?
i don't know, clarence, "doctor zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
i will guard pearl with my life...
chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
that is correct. and how do i decide?
why did you tell them my book was being published?
the guy was a total fruitcake.
six-toed cats. assyrians. abyssinians. it's the same difference. well don't think this terry malloy is any six-toed cockeyed assyrian. he's a bum. charley and johnny friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
oh yeah?  whatta you drink, then?
it doesn't matter how i feel about it. it's how you feel about it that matters.
sure.
well i haven't seen her in months. who knows what's going on in her head.  you're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
don't shoot yourself.
don't hurt me.
what happened? you okay?
i'm not anti-establishment.
oh yeah.
apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
but i feel the force flowing!
so come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 jesus christ, the world is off its rocker. i made $37,000 last year and you...
data to captain picard. geordi and i have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. and, i believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
you're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
i don't know yet.  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  i owe viktor everything.
did you see the size of that thing?!
i'm good at it. lying, cheating, manipulating... i'm good at it.
i was so worried i wouldn't compare with hannah.
hey, i showed 'em to you!
uh, huh...
jamie! get away!
no it hain't, luke. you ain't alone. ever whar you go, i'm with you, and so's john.
that made me cry. but, anyway, we went up to boston, because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.
president?
yes.
no, i don't.
when were you all planning to tell me? a year from now?   after the election...  what's going on here? dave hesitates.
i love your apartment.
you mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
doc.  you called danny 'doc' twice just now.
even a god that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
that's low, but this effects me how exactly?
beer, please.
wadda you so sore about?
what's up?
well, he worked around.
you got the cash?
exquisite!  you said it belongs to...
i'm curious. what was the nuttiest thing i did?
wait ... wait.  you ... you have to help me.  i don't understand.  am i dreaming this?
peter, okay?
if you don't mind i think i'll stay at the hotel.
no, of course not, but i think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
that's too easy.  one minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
sure.  let's discuss betty mayfield.  how long since you saw her?
would that impress you? is that what it takes to impress the empress?
it's them.  they did this.
yes. i don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
i'll expect you for dinner this evening, captain hamilton.  for christ's sake, have a bath.
my mother. died in '72. they told me after. they said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
you told me to change.
low mileage... handles like a dream.
by the way -- it's you.
no. are you?
no. i draw the line.
i'm gonna go ask him.
wave to my son.
is the dead guy in there?
what look?
uhhh...anything i can do for you? she laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
and what? you mean from the beginning? jesus. can i uh okay, as we say in russia can i cut a long story short. okay. nadia is my little cousin. except she's not. but we say cousin. this is for you.
someone dead from this household?
and i'm overwhelmed.  and i want to do it justice.  and i hope we can spend time together.  and i'm gushing.  it's my worst quality.
i wish they'd put us in the same room.
i - i'd really rather not...
yes, sir.
it must've grabbed us.  that's why the truck stalled-out.
bela, i'm on your side.  c'mon, give me the gun...  if you give me the gun, i'll make you a drink.  what are you drinking?
it was great to see everybody again. but it's so boring and regimented. most of what they teach is useless. the worst thing was lunch.
you said we were on the same programming team.
what's going on?!
okay, okay, fran. i deserve that. but just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, fran -- i've stopped running.
but it's my favorite state.
cole, you're scaring me.
i waited another four minutes.
life would go on, and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
freddie?
there was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan. but he was a revolutionary.
and you didn't do anything about it?
he doesn't like to say much does he?
answer the question! have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
we don't know how much time we have. if i can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
"make the shot."
i had... an experience.  of belonging.  of unconditional love. and for the first time in my life i wasn't terrified, and i wasn't alone.
it was wonderful.
on "the planet of galactic peace?"
just spit him back out.  some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
cancel?! cancel?! are you out of your fucking mind?!
connection approved.  ready to transmit --
oh, look. another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director...miss psychotic episode.
it's not me?
maybe i was there, but i didn't see anythin'. all i know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
welcome, neo.  as you no doubt have guessed, i am morpheus.
i love you.
why didn't he kill us?
you're kidding.
i didn't.  you asked me about the card.  you're going to get us into trouble.
he's working very hard - i got him a job driving firefly's car - he's-a driving him crazy and i'm driving him nuts - p-e-a-n-u-t-s
maybe you inspire me.
what's wrong, available?
i know it can't be easy. life hasn't changed that much for reed, sue and johnny. at least they can go out in public. but for you? people staring. whispering behind your back...
then what's...
no, they won't.
yep.
and you were right about that ring. any other weddin' band would not do. but this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
we'd know. there are no secrets in this casino. you'd be punished.
did you find her?!
the sheriffs will take over when they get here.
well, tell him we were here, won't you?
if i'd known you were going to look like this, i never would have put ink in your tea.
what does he want?
i'm terribly sorry.  he doesn't seem to be here ... no ... yes, if i see him, i will. .. goodbye. she's going to phone back.
this is not right.
okay, thanks.
did they ever find out who they were?
can't a boy be a dorrit?
they must have gotten it from the base. no one else would know it.
i wish i knew.
come on!
you know, i was thinkin', maybe we ought to open our own place. that's the real money.  build it up, milk it for all it's worth, then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings.  let's you and me take a walk around town, virge, see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots.
and reverse the mutations --
that man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  i'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  was he really following me--or you?
car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... where did you find these kids?
well, not exactly. see, i met this girl. real nice girl. god-fearing girl. her name's sylvia.
taste this.
how do you know i've been with several women?
where are you going?
i think you could be an actor. i know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
what the hell are you doing? this is my girl. mine!
i know you're not.
who'd you butcher at the house?
you got a boyfriend?
i mean it, there is only three of us here.
news travels fast on broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
daddy, daddy, i can't.
oh, ellen!  i've been wondering when you'd come.  why don't you step in.
instead of going into his mind...
a little modesty would suit you better.
who came in after you?
you're not listening. he isn't better. he gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
father, did i act like that when i graduated from high school?
what?
look, eric it's your little friends.
it turned out phil green, mr integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the tangiers...
i don't know his name ...  i saw the whole story.  a wounded bird was on his roof.  i could hear its cries from here. he went straight to it.  i couldn't've. i'd be frozen between pity and fear. but he wasn't.  its pain spoke directly to him.  he picked it up.  nursed it. fed it.  and it got better.  everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  everyday the pigeon would watch him. i saw him learn. learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. and one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  didn't look back.  but he heard the sound of its wings.
that's right.
i met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  tall fellow.  no hair.  rather pale skin...
steamroller stuff, joe? my methods don't go in washington? they've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
that bad?
you mean they haven't told you yet?
it.  tell it.  for all i know it could be a machine.
that's embarrassing?
didn't they tell you?
i know.  but then i reconsidered.  'cause i figured out what i really wanna do with my life, what i want to do for a living is i wanna be with your daughter.  i'm good at it.
can i have a month's vacation?
george.
oh, so i'm the bad guy now?
i know cartman, i know.  i see kenny every day.
you're my only son...
you equipped for random questions?
make a list.
sam the man.
with my luck, now it'll rain.
well not any more, now i'm a serious writer and above this crap.
it was a she.
i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created.
your view of what?
better than cousteau, or compagno with computers, telemetry, defense department funding...
admiral, may i ask you a question?
more time...shit, she's had 400 years...
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, kal-el. could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
alright. there's someone i want to check out. a woman called gillian layton.
since he was born.
i haven't paid you.
somebody took my blender.
it was the only way, auggie. otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
picked it up in shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
the monkey, of course. it was his idea.
i'm in a mess today, too.  i'm thinking about doing it with mike. what do you think?
chemco makes many things senator! we were under government contract!
i heard something like that
i got a surprise for you.
what do you mean?
the superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
yeah, that part.  there's... somebody who's um...
i never thought of that.
a peace officer... impressive man
three minutes. we're going in light. myself and two others. everyone else is held back in reserve.
eleven o'clock! 
i will.
you said that the last time.
i can't...
yes.  but it wasn't really.  it was just...
nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
dooler, you know bob sugar.
so?
buffy!
fifty cents admission.
i mean i'd -- i'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. i just have a toothbrush. i can get it myself. if that's all right.
well, he does know the background. i doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. there should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
uh, no, i didn't see him at all.
oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
maybe he can.
you really want to know, sir?
we're doomed.  goodbye, mistress leia.  goodbye, captain ...
excuse me?
where is she then?
thanks.
can we let go?  you past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
what is it with you, man, huh? how do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? that scotch bullshit? am i really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? you were bankrupt, man.
thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
ellie—
i'd better be going.
perhaps you didn't hear what i said, mr. deeds! the whole semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
i'm through with you.
i couldn't even face that one.
so, what do you think?
friedman’s dead... they killed him...
come on, mother, that's just the military mentality. never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. if there's one atom of life...
oh... mr. gardiner... mr. chauncey gardiner... you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you?
did she?
no.
you did this -- in a day?!
i don't like sugar
so i took his truck, yeah.
puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
you girls aren't from brooklyn or anything?
someone you know?
whose room was this?
what the hell does that mean?
it's a trick! after him.  they're in the south stairwell!
good?! good?! words fail you at last! it's terrific! now i'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
i'm so sorry.
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
do you expect me to believe that?
i wouldn't know. the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
nuthin'.
tell me you'll call.
work, lunch, groceries, laundry... fabulous...
no, i can't...
there's hot cider in the kitchen.
goodbye, francis.
come on you pansy!
you'll be okay.
who the fuck is this?
and then i lost him.  in the fog.
thirty dollars? well, er, what are you after? i mean, what do you want? a journalistic career?
oh, no, alvy, please. alvy, please.  m'mrnm.
you know i can't do that.
what do you think?
...and you don't remember. 'cause you weren't around.  that's cold calling.  walk up to the door.  i don't even know their name.  i'm selling something they don't even want.  you talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
let's just go get guns, i'd feel better.
hello, freshie. did you make that report out yet?
irena. but who are you?
it must be nice to always believe you know better.  to think you're always the smartest person in the room.
what'd you do before?  can i ask?
ding dong? oh ding dong bell, eh?
we can't shoot in the old mill.
yeah, well, we're not.
here i am, father...
i understand.  i understand, thank you. --how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
your name?
i'm telling you that's my car!   and someone's gonna pay for it!
i need money.
mm.
oil can what?
i said i want the truth.
yes -- let's run!
i think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
i'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
but did they teach you this?
what do you whistle?
you'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
you said things would be fine, and they're not.
yeah, i know. to that girl who moved to pittsburgh.
i get to the restaurant and he's not there. i waited for forty- five minutes.  when i called his office, his secretary said they thought i had cancelled.  i had cancelled!  then i get back to my office and <u>aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
lotte! why aren't you at the pet shop?
books. he's my biographer.
i don't want to act in it, i want to produce it with harry. especially if i help him get martin.
i've got the ropes loose now. i've got my hands free.  be careful--don't change your expression too much.  they must not catch on.
what's this?
what do you mean?
it's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. i can't imagine what made you do such a thing. a reporter! of all things, a reporter! a barbarian who lets his socks come down!
hence the radiation.
but, i don't understand.
hey you!!
moving story.
what, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  the scene's perfect...i, i get to say...
no.
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time.
kaufman, i'm going to need information on mr. chauncey gardiner's background.
you stole my boat.
you do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
miss viridiana ...
so could you walk on water?
try me.
just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the manchester cotton company...
what papers?
jimmy, you've got --
maybe you should just drop us off. i'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
gee whiz, dad--
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories. eating my lines.
wait! we go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
milo. what's up?
now i didn't mean that, you rat.
of course i saw it.
i'm scared shitless.
do you know where you're going?
the fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
oh. oh god. gale --
then where did you get this not my tape.
well, it's not going to work. so you'd better go.
it was you, charley... .
can't you find somebody else?
i'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
are there any more at home like you?
i looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
is it hot in here?
i don't know.  everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
what are you doing?
okay, doc. what's the damage? how much time have i got?
which is?
three days you've laid there. it's time you ate.
jones isn't in his room. miss scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi --
not all...i needed another four months and i would have had them all.  i guess you've figured it all out?
i've drunk enough tonight.
god bless you.
very funny, smart ass.
of course, one must admit he has great courage.
maybe you should have just a half.
you want me to be the bastard.
is she alive?
then what's the problem?
the evidence was very meager --
hello, mulvaney here...
oh my god!  in here!  in here!
they're coughing.
good morning, mr. brandon.
no, i don't think you do. and besides... i haven't decided yet.
but, after all, you have yours.
girl, do you still sing and dance?
there! you said it was boring.
i'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  to "joe gordon, care of new york mail, new york. am i laughing. the biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. i know where ellen andrews is—"  no, do you really?
i almost forget when i ate last.  it looks so good.... you know, mostly i get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
you are the guardian, willow.  you must take her to tir asleen.
something wrong?
friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis.
that's ok.
personally?
every day for the last six years i've thought about only two things. the first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. if i would even recognize him if i saw him on the street.  the second was what i would do to the man who took him.
hey!  i heard screaming...
why do you keep coupling me with falco?
did they find out anything when they questioned her?
mr. duke? hello, mr. duke, i'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... i thought i should call again, because i was wondering...
will you read it for me?
you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
well he's not exactly a friend.
what?
yup.  that's him goin'.  i love to watch him go.
why imitate a dead serial killer?
i don't care. i need my hat.  i won't go without it.
i was waiting to see what would happen. i didn't want to kill him if i didn't have to.
... i'm partial to the tight end.
no thanks. plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
what if someone finds out?
yes sir.
what the heck are those for?
paxcow says it's almost too late!
i think i'm going to throw up.
yeah.
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
sam!
mom's home?...
so what are you bringing me?  looks like you got some film cans.
look, there's no fuckin' way i'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. then we might have something to talk about. now step away from the car.
last year.  i -- it was broken off.
preoccupied with what?
i think you're mad! you're really mad!
yeah, follow us.
what're your taking down?
yeah.
thanks, gary...take care, man, i gotta get back.
i mean, that's what it's like.
i don't know. whatever you like it to be.
who's tony?
it really is beautiful, isn't it?
laurie, you come with us...
good, and commander skywalker?
jimmy? bushmills.  lookit, do me a favor. i'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
look at this, pinkerton! they got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
where the hell are we?
you look awful.
i mean -- working together. just like the old days. the things we've been through, hildy.
altar boys?
better let the doc take a look at you, after dinner.
i've heard a lot about you, mr. sisco.
you were screaming you weren't nick! and we just didn't fucking believe you!
i don't buy that. there's a place for hatred.  did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her.  do you know what that feels like?
she knew you'd find out who lisa henderson is.  you're a good cop -- what did she do?  tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  did she tell you in bed, nick? that's how i'd do it.
we can't just sit here, austin.
what would you do if it was a daughter?
miss boatwright --
sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
that was quite an evening. bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
christ, you scared the shit out of me.
there's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- i never owed that much.
your name is not eve harrington. it is gertrude slescynski.
max?
i did?
i wouldn't.
god, can you hear me!
why do you take shit from him?
what's wrong?
what the hell?
don't worry. really. don't worry.
sorry ethan.  times up.  say goodbye.
...i should?
no. you're right.
chess. chess is often used as well.
except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
go to hell!
luther, i'm looking at security.
please.
boy, i'll say.  they gave you a real toon-a-roo.
kaboom.
we'll just be a minute.
that's what i'm talkin' 'bout. that's what i'm talkin' 'bout.
behind a desk for a little while.  a desk!  they had him planning air raids.  a city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan.  there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  ask about spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade.  he was a famous sniper.  they called him "la picadura"--"the sting."
she was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
you've led a charmed life.
it means "bloodbrother."
... come in, chauncey - please come in...
well, martin, i only wear them in washington -- that's the trouble. but if you ever come down there, i'll show them to you.
fletch!
thirty seconds. that's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
then don't have a drink.
typical...
sure, go ahead.
landon! send a last signal.
like diamonds, huh?  i never get over it. when i was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  she'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, i don't know, it was like she really believed it.
really?
i'll take the .45 and the webley .32.
i'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
jeez, look at that guy.
did you talk to him?
smitty.
and perfect.  cut!
you mean that play?
gal, you're talking to john henry. when was i sick?
wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
questions? well, heck, i'll tell you anything you want to know.
except for prom.
this is a ludicrous situation. there must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
thank you, sid, but the reason i mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
but, paulie, i'm sorry. believe me.  i was fucking crazy.  but i'm okay now. i can be trusted.  i'm clean now. on my children. believe me! two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
you alone, or you got confederates?
this dock is off-limits to civilians.
erysipelas.
what do you mean "don't worry?"
how do you know that?
king of the who?
i've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man van ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
you're kidding.  a crematorium? jesus.
if we ... er ... 
diane, maybe you didn't hear mr. silverberg. they've got models that'll try on the garments.  thank you, sir.
clark, everything i was saying -- can't you see i only say it because i really care?
you seem sad, spooky.
well i wouldn't. i would never say it if it wasn't true.
frankie, come in. good to see you.      you want something?
al.  man, you were my rock.  i couldn't have made it without you.
some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  you two weren't invited?
people.
you think you could find me a pencil and paper?
you want a dressing bag, john?
what do you mean by necessary? she's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend johnnie farragut.
forget it.
importation value?  at twenty-two thousand a ki...
a wino? jesus, are you from the fifties? a wino!  face it, joel. you're freaked out because i was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
you knew. you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this... but you weren't up front with me. you sent me in to him naked.
is he upset?
where do we go?
yeah, i give a shit.
you mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  euww.
nine years?
you remember your dreams, grady?
they're grilling the applicant for the vacant post.
can't that wait, hubert?
do you think you'll find her?
ask sal.
what?
what do we do?
i was concerned.  as i said, women in that part of cairo, a european women, i felt obliged to.
well?
... hey, i don't need your charity ...
i should go with her, sandy.
who's this fat man, then?
are you?
no -- but i will ask.
only if kennedy dumps johnson.
shall we go on?
does that work?
i didn't run away. i left the flat.
your life has been defined by institutions.  the orphanage where you were raised, the fbi academy, the bureau.  if the institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  ask to be reinstated on the "drumgo" task force.  play their game.
...and then she just breaks down.  and he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  i mean...
i don't know. salmon. don't you always have white wine with fish?
you know how that toby is.  thinks every man he sees is after his jenny.
you want that for here or to go?
yes, sir.
she's not!
brill.
'kay, good. bye, then...
very.
not even that.
it can't be as bad as that.
welcome to the hotel earle. may i help you, sir?
where to?
pull over and listen to me, will you? just listen..
can you come next door? i gotta make a phone call.
nothing but civilians, gene.
who did this?

no...he's really sick.  i heard him last night.  the company will take that into consideration...
yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
oops! i dropped it!
they were steven, they were.  it's been a miracle it has.  he lasted right through and healed.  no one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  ever.
mind if i smoke?
are we free, buljanoff?
yeah.
i decided to give you one more chance.  i missed you.
thats not a story, alex. it's a corpse.
yes.  and you will give general cushman full access.
how come ben can't turn it on and off like us?
what are you going to do?
everybody does.
: because he's guy perkins.  listen, you want to walk to na- na's and get something to eat?
has warner huntington checked in yet?
julie, i'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. i've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. i mean a lot. but none of them make me feel like you do.
you can't leave. she won't let you.
i'll be okay.
does anyone know his politics?
nothing.
you can send me the address too.
shit boy you been out in the sun too long. you try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
no big deal. i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine... i mean, i did write the program for it.
i am so sorry, jesse.
the best.
hey boss, dekom trust is owned by pan illinois... which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics... which is a division of windy city ventures... who's partners are...  alan seagrave, donald cosgrove, and jeffrey holcomb.
how can you tell it was deliberately buried?
i'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  did you get id off any of them?
i mean she's only sober about two hours a day. it's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. and if i gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? she's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  where would you be then? comin' right back to me, right back to me.  or finding some other excuse to come and i - i -
congratulations, field agent kensington!
but look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
yes, i am, sir.
alright.
no, you couldn't.
i think so.  but they're in room 408.  on the fourth floor.
he sure loves to stay awake.
mrs. leavitt--
no!...  we didn't anything...
any history of epilepsy in your family?
i have something to tell you.
what?
"fifteen minutes of fame?" i'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
- you're not.
how are you feeling today?
but we can get to the west side faster.
so?!  is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
she didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. that stuff was all gone through last night.  anything special you're looking for, inspector?
no, no.  see, all my life i've done things for other people.  in high school i played football because my old man expected me to.  then my parents always figured i'd go to law school, so i did.  football scholarship.  graduated phi beta kappa--
yes, you will. you theater people always do. nothing is forever in the theater. love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
what are you going to do? now that you've quit the police force?
closest planes for hire are here in cache.
is she sleeping or...?
it's just the god damned english doing everything by the book.
sorry. you've lost me...
you okay?
smoke her.
look, it's not a big deal! i can fix it! all i gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
hi mom.
oh, paul. it's beautiful.
healy you dog!
is it nice?
javier rodriguez.
ssshh! what was that?
no, but i'm goddamn thirsty. ice water?
david lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
i did that on purpose. i don't have to miss.
what?
no, nothing like that.  billy's wife, lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  he took over raising the children by himself.  it was obvious how much he missed lydia.
that too. everyone does what they can to survive.
yes, sir.
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the blue diamond of the crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time louis lost everything from the neck up. the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became le coeur de la mer. the heart of the ocean. today it would be worth more than the hope diamond.
it was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, i think they call it... it wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
last night.
are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
no, no that was cadet dunbar --
sorry i'm late -
jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
due north.  at five knots...no, six!
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
she'll tell them everything...
you needn't bother.
the lunch hour. he probably worked it out in advance. he found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
yes, sir, of course, sir, i was merely speaking hypothetically.  if this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  but of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
but who?  where did you meet him?
i'm not.
i'm here with jenny.
debbie...
nope, not even close. i've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
where am i?
dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
i said we are totally booked.
owwww...you're hurting me... you're hurting me...i hate you ...i hate you...
why do you do it?
oh, uh... buzz... is it important?
hey tits, i'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
i thought i had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
the guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
i knew your managing editor very well.
fair enough.  you know i got to admit, you got a lot of bark on you comin' up here like this.
say, what happened to your hand?
i swear to god charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why i didn't go to work.  i swear it.
no.
are you peggy sue kelcher?
lloyd is doomed.
good morning, mr. kirkeby.
last week, about 3 a.m., fish -- dr. fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
get rid of 'em.
susan, you're a hell of a woman. you've got a great career, you're beautiful --
him?
i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
what does that mean?
let me speak to ellen....
who is this.
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
dent it a little. boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. she had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
i'm not staying in my room, uncle charles.
that's perry.
i don't <u>think</u> so.
you don't know what you're missing. this is the mt. everest of hacks.
someone better tell mac.
they're not following me, dan.  i mean -- jon's gone, we're right on the brink of world war iii.  nobody cares about the watchmen.
i think jeff bridges is getting tired.
insane ... ?
a treaty?  don't be ridiculous. what treaty is this?  who made it? who has been giving orders?
okay.
what does that mean?
what time did you get in?
whatever you say, man.  look ... can we talk about this?
no. i must deactivate you.
i like your car.
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. for it gives you great strength.  the strength of _knowledge_.  the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
witless and misleading. why do you think he takes their skins, officer starling? thrill me with your wisdom.
what i called you...  why, what did i call you?
you sure you feel up to it, nathan?
in one goddamn night?  what are ya sprayin' money around like that for? you coulda been nailed.
take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
they call me green jack, ma'am.
get out of the car.
back off, just go away you klutz. alright, here's the story. the items in these cases belong to me. i designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
manson beat you.
the content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. really, omniplatforms. including whatever new hardware emerges.
me? what if she don't want me?
do her? huh huh.
go back inside! this is none of your business!  i don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
we have to find out what's happened to them. i think they're gone...
detective williams here. yeah. tell him to go to sergeant milton. yeah, copy.  well, jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. very interesting. i know you must be curious to know more.  but. i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. one day, when it's all sewed up, i'll let you know all the details. right now, though, i can't.
baby. you are so hot!
you brought the girl!
my legacy.
help me.
i was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
did you give her the money?
hey, wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
sid.
so can i come along?
no, no, no, i'm staying put. if i'm going to die, i prefer to die at home.
i have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
poor cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
i...i don't know.
no, this is on the level, walter. i'm not good enough to make this one up. the sheriff gave his gun to the professor, the professor gave it to earl, and earl gave it right back to the professor -- right in the stomach! who? no, egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. they took him to the county hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
the washington post.
evelyn, right?
do you call it a game when only one man win each time? i think you call it a damn shame.
mr. taylor?
peace?!
he thinks he is. he says his mother was apache, but i suspect he's lying.
no.  no... don't go yet.  i feel as if i... i don't understand you. and i want so much to understand.
there was a second.
you're one of them, aren't you?  a fucking pro.
i want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. i'll ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so he can join us. we're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the goren system.
well, to tell you the truth, i lied a little.
well . . . uh . . . i . . .
when you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at bishop's pub. they let you pass the hat. all these kids do that. most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
and buckaroo banzai.
you're possessive.
are you going to leave, mr. kirkeby, or do i have to throw you out?
i meant --
one apple pie! you want more coffee?
really, captain, it was a lovely toast.
you said we were going to trust him now. you said there was a deal.
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now. when i first met you, and i made you that tape, you loved it.  you said -- and i quote -- "it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
...four days..?
helena --
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy.
it's saturday, arnie.  you work too hard.
what the fuck happened?
well, at the expense of some of the furniture, susan--you've made another conquest.
i'm afraid, prof. nothing makes sense.  please help me.
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
but they picked me, right? so what i'll do, i'll just say, now look, you want me? well, i don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
then take her down.
did they tell you to sleep with me?
you'd be surprised how often they are.
you're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
tapert.  so, now i've got tapert, butterfield.
plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
uh, ninety days. and now i just have to go once a week. see, i'm rehabilitated.
oh my g-d!  i'm not first!
is there anything i need to know to see about mom?
you sure you passed on my message?
truly? do speak.
what the hell is wrong with you?
you got caught. it's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. but now we gotcha. ok, mr. elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
nice.  almost done.
i'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. being a professional.
well? surprised?
goddamn it, i ask you a question, you better answer it, or i'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
what does this have to do with my testimony?! i told the truth! it's valid and true and provable!
he could see me.
okay, deal.
well, you didn't forget me.  i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield.
hi.
say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that i've ever... where's that stenographer? miss flaemm...
forget it.
well, what am i supposed to say? "i can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
i say we off-load some of that gold now.
sir, if you were not a captain, i would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
will she still love him with that special perfect love?
sure. by shooting at me.
i like working for the bureau, sir. i like catching bad guys. it's all i care about.
gawd...you're...beautiful...
oh yes, i do.
you know, i wonder what the secnav would think about it.  if i spoke with him.
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury. 
*happy*! what are you thinkin'? how am i supposed to take care of a baby! i can't have a baby.
where'd he get all this?
that's the craziest thing i ever heard. absolutely not.
damn!  close the door! i'll be right back.
i was trying to pay you a compliment, i was guising it as science 'cause i know you're comfortable in that arena. science.
why?
when they coming in?
i don't hate you, jimmy.  but i have a couple questions that i wanna ask....
i've just come back from the hospital. your victim has died.
he says a dog bit his nose.
what is it?
listen, jim -- and if you wisecrack while i'm talking i'll crown you with the inkwell.
nothing.
they stole it.
yes.  there's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. there's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
i dunno.
abort.  thatís an order.
what about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
i'd hold that off awhile.
you guys know my cousin mikey sullivan?
let's get the fuck out of here!
you don't know anything. you did it your way and she died.
i'm through clowning. you're all washed up. get out!
notice that nothing happens.  now say 'montana.'
you need to explain it.
beverly, come in.
excuse me for interrupting, governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
calf love. i loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
start looking into the joe boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
daddy, it can't be just because of that.  there had to be other factors.
he's not going to give us direct hints. he's going to skirt around it.
all right.  tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
uh-huh.
please wait!... surely he would have found a way! if there was so much at stake -- spock would have found a way!
jeffrey, honey. your father's condition is serious. it's going to cost so much. we just won't have the money to keep you in school. i'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. you're going to have to work at the store.
but i'd, i'd do it for free. you know, just for my reel.
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  so he climbs up.  to cut it down.
still worried?
wait a minute...
it's beginning....
i don't know.  if this one's any faster than that other one...
what're you writing, lois?
did my matzohs come?  get some for everybody.  thank you.  lemme tell you about my first movie...
phone call, clarice. it's god.
in nomine patris et filius, et spiritus sancti.
the key, goddamit, the key!
turned czech huh?
i didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on tv.
gaelic.
we're not getting anywhere here. why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
it's only that i really enjoy your company and...
forgot?  you handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
no.  no bats, no flying.  they... float, occasionally.  not really flying.
that's what he said.
all i have is hundreds.
i done et just a little bit ago.
he can't drink this milk. it'll make him sick. he's on a formula.  i was a fool! i shouldn't have kept him with me.
you've been under such a strain. and i've ...i've --  -- neglected you. mea culpa! y'know.
i don't know -- i never saw his face.  all i know is, the next day i was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  look, man, you gotta go through with this.
now you need approval from him to go home?
i'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
i didn't know what to do - but i knew i had something somebody would want.  that's where i met him - told him what i had.  the fbi set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  so i ran...and met you.
those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  hey!  where are you guys?  people gotta use this road, you know! you on a booze break or what?!
do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
leonard, how's the feed?
think zimmermann's watching?
i'd love to get you in an operating room. just once.
why... why... why... ?
what?
ok. marcie. starting now i want you to have a new attitude with me.  the more you play games, the more suspicious i'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
only to keep warm.  for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
i feel better. now how do you fire this damn thing?
nah, i don't wanna break up with wanda, i just wanna see carmen too.
right -- want another one?
he treated me as if i were a child...
sure. shall i -- i mean shall i just stand here? i mean -- i don't know what you want me to do.
stop talking...
keep painting.  promise me.
irving berlin.
don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
no, three thousand at least. he'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. that's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. he'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. but he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. but i wouldn't count on it.
do you trust me, julie?
can you now? aah ... sheeps' heads! you learn more by getting out there and living.
but of course you are. dinner at eight.  wouldn't miss it.
so why does he call himself bertrand?
what's the job?
i feel...  i feel they're out to <u>get</u> me...
i just got to town.
and what do you propose? that we knock this guy off?
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit.
thank you, herb.  you're a wonderful man.  you really are. everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the little league.
i'm not sure he's a lunatic.
so do i. so what? i'm doing all right.
i am too old to climb down a rope.
you might think -- i thought so myself at first -- that burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. but that's the very reason to beware! it's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
you had no choice, elaine.  he's a liability.
yo, showtime, showtime!
i wasn't.
so?
: wait. do you know any gay guys?
do you love him?
i didn't do anything.
say, 'nigger, fuck me hard!'
i 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
half a million.
i'm sorry -- i don't know what gets into him.
kay-em we made it!
you are the one who's good-hearted.  as for rose, let's hope for the best.
gittes.
she says it's not.
can't let you in...  sorry.
i know, but . . .
it could have been worse. if the cops hadn't come, i might not be standing here now.
don't cry, wee one.  it's a better place i go to.
better try a little higher.
dakota.
well,then i have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
look what i found.  remember these?
okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and i don't care.  i'd weather blizzards to have you. you're the most perfect man i've ever known.
because they've been paid off by bellmoth.
-- we practice!  sorry, cleo.
hey, i'd definitely shoot color on that one, jimmy. it'd be a crime to just use black and white.
was her breakfast conversation that bad?
happy days.
who is it?
i've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  for hours ...
don't look back! act naturally!
look, i'm in here.  you call this a career move?
i wouldn't say that.
that was him.
your wife, sir? has she gone away?
i thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
any trouble?
did you receive the letter?
we could start a two-person stock company. if things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. we'll call this one "the great deception."[8]
why don't you think so?
it must be about that appalling script of hers.  what can i say to her? what can i say?
where am i gonna start?
i wanted to fuck her, that's all!
do? to who?
yeah, come on, play it.
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but i'm not going to. i'm too mad-
the cubicle across from you is empty.
uh, home, you know.
that's how it is, chum. one column - and i can bring all this tumbling down. i can take you off the streets for good.
where is it?
captain, we can't trust anyone now.
what you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
where will the money go?
i sent a letter to doug today. i'll be so glad when he gets out here.
it takes different strokes to move the world.
don't worry about me, i'm changing coordinates now.  i've come to far to be tripped up by some dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
we can't grab it...
it's almost six.  and guess what? hall likes me bathed and shaved.
how are you doing, kid?
why, you need me for the story?
any room for me in this cinema paradiso? 
i guess so -- but i went home and did me some praying to the lord. i said, lord, i went into this white church down in row and all i want you to tell me is how i ever got outta there in one piece.
a half mill on an eight to one shot. you're dumber than i thought, lonnegan.
i want to die.
plain soda?
such as?
i was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  your mistake, if i may be so bold, was promotion. commanding a starship is your first best destiny. anything else is a waste of material.
oh, yeah...
friend ogg.  excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
we lost ...
you gotta let me go, daddy. please...
will you chance a miss?
stop it, doyle!
solved the whiteman case with this.
whoa there...
i guess i should go.
i love you.
the 6 horse is last.
why don't you get a job? if you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
someone else might call it stalking.  my dad felt it.  he started carrying a gun.
that's cute, kathryn.  real cute.
...that was vicki, her best friend. dat dress will cast ya round...
just give me twenty-four hours. please. someone almost killed me today. people are not being nice lately, and i don't want you getting hurt. i think you're terrific. are you a laker fan?
he's all right.
take care of yourself, ben.
the why'd the police let him go?
i know.
nope. that's the road. straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
i...
okay, i'm closing up. everybody relax.
well, not exactly...
are you using minoxidil?
blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
toby... who the fuck is toby? toby... toby... think... think... think...
hardly farmers. i've done some checking. all these were in the war. these men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. they are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. if i were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what i would create.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
think about it.  how do you think i got in here?  did you hear any glass break?  did you hear a door splinter?  how did the evening end? after you went to bed did she linger a bit?  maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  is that what happened?
i'll see you, bill.
name your poison and i'll supply it.
it's for people!
jammed--? by who? whom by?
oh, i'm terribly sorry.
i saw a man die.
air-raid?
this is going to do nothing.
shit!
who's here!?
like what?
actually i want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
god, that smoke's poisonous!
i'm trying, alright?  just tell me what we've got.
i told you, there is no way out. he won't let you go.
then what?
hey, look at him. tommy. you grew up.
but not over me?
never mind that. what's the story?
that game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
you don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
miss braslow, i'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention?
i didn't think you did.  if you had, i wouldn't have asked you again, because i'd have remembered. how old?
you were the new and improved you.
beggar. we're at a disadvantage with outpost. our experts aren't as smart as theirs. sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. i'm taking a shot in the dark, here. i can offer you 32,000 a year, a buick. i'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
relax, ellis.  i'm off duty.
how many men does cornwallis have under his command?
what do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
i got no ears! i can't hear!
come on, try it. ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. come on!
hell of a defense mechanism.  you don't dare kill it.
it's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
what do you figure he done with it?
unlikely.
nicky. i was thinking about you. i went to the preview last night.
do you have something to say?
think i spoke too soon...
well, i guess you got what you came for.
i'm perfectly calm, george, i'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood... mummers...
it was romantic.   he's very romantic.
now you're saying eduard was lured there?
need any company?
possession of unregistered machine guns.
gosh, you had me fooled.
no, really.
thanks for helping with the bag.  it looks great!
i'm coming with you.
a storm dragon?
how curious ...
louis, whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape?
yes, where?
what are you lookin' for?
-- and god the angry parent, and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
it's real, brandon. all of it, it's real.
stop her louis!
first time in a grav couch?
after a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. sometimes i feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... but the thing i'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... that's rare.
i'm listening.
oh, miss kubelik. how do you feel?
same old stuff.  i'm watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
sir?
then the emperor has already won. you were our only hope.
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting?
i changed my mind.
you must have come a long way.
a champagne cocktail, please.
now we have fifteen requests for the emperor's palace...and one for tokyo baseball stadium.
or the f.b.i.?
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  i contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
why are you trying to hurt me?
i got what i paid for.
where's pete?
and now you're going to eat it?
come on. i wancha to meet a frienda mine. raymond, get enough beer for ben too.
watch me.
how long have you been setting up?
the bearer of bad news.
come into the kitchen.  i'm just making your mother's tea.
so, dr. venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
i still am.
but check this...
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
what'd you expect? that's his job.
i'm only looking out for you.
say again. sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
i want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
he'll, what else can i do with it all?
anything.
ask them to wait a little longer. for the twins.
what thought is that?
you called me your girl?
a dime. one thin dime for a cup of coffee.
yo, that's my girl.
leave it on! now we are going to do this thing. we are going to have a conversation. think of another topic.
now just a minute, sir!  you're way out of line!
didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
why do you fret about something that isn't there?
promise me... you won't ever tell domino.
who can i say is calling?
no one ever thought so. you must bring it out.
let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- i'll just lay it on the line!  what about that big rumpus in my office today?  you were there, frank! where, according to st. dallas, j.j. was responsible for the elwell smear!
i'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
what are you going to do?
it's got nothing to do with reality, oskar, i know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  it's got a ritual significance to them, jews shoveling snow.
what?
well...
tea.
oh no you can't. get on with the painting.
[lot of] how many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
come ooonnn. tommeeee. we're only kidding. you can't take a joke? come ooonn.
which one is that?
we're working on that...
hanover!! hanover!!
much better, thanks.
yes, baron.
you do?
the trick is not to think about it. see that one? the widow st. clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. she's perfect for you. go ahead.
not very precise directions.
puerto rican rum. see for yourself.
fifty degrees below and still falling.
...were of you.
so, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
someone's got to do it, henryk.
aren't we stayin'?
well, marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
don't lie. you don't believe me either.
no, virginia, i know how you feel.
he wasn't in on it.  you set him off by going to rekall.
okay? with this pad, the killer wheels? looks like you really cleaned up your act.
that's it, of course. when i'm up there and doing it, i'm cheating it every second. i'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. i'm skating the edge of it.
your powers are greater than you know.  have you ever seen one of these?
yes.
not at all.... i understand perfectly, count d'algout gave you a dog. you made it very clear, madame.
i got you, del...
cut to the chase, william randolph. your audience is way ahead of you.
isn't this your vehicle?
right, max, forget it. aren't you gonna be late for meeting annie?
when i see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, i always picture them naked, even if i don't want to. i have intrusive thoughts all the time.
my god...!  what time is it?
have to get these wet things off.
yeah? why're you here?
even though his dick is so big?
i sabotaged it?  you're the one who lost him, remember?
come in, joe -- i want to thank you -- okay, bill?
quite well, really. it's a lot of work. a lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. right now i've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. tiny napkins of course.
rescue one -- please be advised ranger walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
no problem.
thank you...
i'd like to bomb their emperor too.  but i think that'd just piss 'em off.  the idea here, gentlemen, is not revenge. we're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  so let's try this again.  military targets only.
order up!
you waited til tonight to tell me?
of course you can.
i'm pleased with you, sera... how you have moved up in the world. i showed you a glamorous world when i took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
i batted!
sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell i'm talkin' 'bout.
worse... you're in texas.
well... now what? what do, you have for us now. boiler?
i know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. if you'll just be patient, i can work things out.
and sometimes you think you don't?! well, get away then!
the stuff we got last night.
why?  what are you going to do?!
impressive -- is it not?  the problem is i can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  i need more power to hold the form longer.  i need the highlander.  where is he?
you see, major, you have nothing to worry about rick.
what i've always wanted, to teach you.
abbott.  he knows about the embassy. he's coming down for a show and tell.
maybe.
okay.  check, please. can i -can i... can i... can i...
i can't do it.
omigawd, honey, i'm so happy for you.
some say that hessians are invincible.
oh, i'm sure he's there.  you're just not looking hard enough.
didn't know adlai had it in him. too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
spent time in arizona. why?
from here i got access to every piece of data ever stored on dade murphy's parents. his parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. hmm.
what'd they take?
he's blind, for chri...
you're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
you can't be late though.
oh no. in the car you did it?
of course. as soon as possible.
when might that be?
put me down, you lout!
my next delivery is up that way, so i'll be getting down to it real soon.
yeah, i've had it forever.  i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up.
the hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
yeah, we have mr. morris levine's eightieth birthday party on riverside drive...or riverside memorial chapel, depending on his health.
so quiet. you get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
here...
all right, you two, move along.
it would seem so, master
wait, wait. i'm trying to figure this out. this is like rona barrett. before you become saved, god already knows who you are?
find out about a company called c.r.s.  consumer recreation services.
let me go!
what can i tell you? he's my leader.
friends with potential.
i promise.  dead poets honor.  come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, i swear i'll bow out.
what do you think, george, shall i resign?  it's what they want.
how come you didn't catch your bus?
i go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone -
i think you're right.
you get mugged or something?
it shouldn't last. gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
he ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  he took his time.  the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  the victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  that's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  popped him.
well we do.  he's chummin' around with a big c named henry gondorff. ring any bells?
you buying?
how much ammo do we have to make a stand?
she <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
yeah?
i don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. the lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
so, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  and if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  that's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
hold your course. look sharp...
what's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
what i've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like i said, the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix.
british promises are honored. and the militia will not be released. because i need more definite proof than this man's word!
throw it.  c'mon, right in the chest.
oh.
it's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
and you said...
claire?
because i'm pissed off. now give me your cash.
i... uh... that wasn't me, it was samuel... i mean nathan...
vigi, vigi, vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
they'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
tender-headed runs in my family. you tender-headed?
kiss the back of my knees.
so you got cozy with she who stings?
hey, i got an idea.
not before i settle with you, chickenshit!
i told you i'm a damn killer. i done it before.  i'm more killer than him.
no, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. we were innocent, man. if we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  it's freedom, man.
bill.
i'm sorry, i just hallucinated.
are you alright?
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic.  turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  they figure we've finally gotten saddam off their backs.  they brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... i'm their new best buddy.  america number one, joe. but there's something the shi'ites can't figure out:  they can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow americans, left me out in the desert.  they can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost.  it's almost as if they were iraqi spies, or something.  and i've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the iraqis.  see how i mean?
david.
yes, yes, i understand.
now that's magneto talking.
this weekend.
the dope ring. you must know what's going on in this hotel. why do you think we're here?
what are you going to do?
they dig for the gems to support our cause. they also search for the last two stones. soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful!
why can't it be her?
thanks for the great time.
viktor, we simply have to talk about "eternity..."
does she have pms?
but you knew this was important to me.
only one guys checked in?
how do you know that?
well, i have to say, i'm impressed.  you never gave up.
riddick? what the hell are you --
not bad, not bad.
what's the delay?
i said keep your nose out of my life. no kid is going to tell me how to run it.
it also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
then when? i have to talk to you.
what is it?  what's the matter?
pete... you okay?
what do you want with my baby?
how?
nope.
where you going, dude?
oh. why didn't you just say so?
you gonna forget about the money i owe you?
no thanks.
hey, nick?
no.
funny, i never thought of you that way.  you were so close too.  we were all pretty stupid about you.
boy, i sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
your desert island top-five.
it's shorter than our practice runway.
okay fine.
it's in the driveway.
with jennifer.
the code's changed. we need artoo!
what's the story with you two? you a couple of fags?
you better handle what's in this garbage can first.
oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? was it romantic?
you're fired. you're outta the department.
should be.  it cost three hundred dollars.
i've heard your mother on 3ya. the woman's session has lots of lively debate.
so is dewey your real name?
i was just looking in an old annual and...
you get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and i have to patch everything up. you get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. to top it all off, you ruin my relationship. what's your encore? do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  you know what the real tragedy is? i'm not even supposed to be here today!
i'm sorry.
i'd like to try them someday. i'm not sure i'd be much good at it.
and you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
goddamn landlord.
i guess we could go to disneyland or something.
what, jack? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? bullshit!
anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
the partridge family?
what'd you all talk about?
now and then. you know how it is.
that's what i'd like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
sure, right.
the corleone family, senator.  we called it, &quot;the family.&quot;
it was great.
y-yes, jim.
god i'm tired.  what a trip i was lousy.  i was worse than lousy. everytime i pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. kaboom.  i--
keep your eye on that brass ring. don't let anything side-track you.
give me a break, i'm asking you out.
you're on your own, understand?
i'm all right.
that perfume you're wearing, antonia. it wouldn't happen to be cristaile, would it?
nazis?! -- is that the limit of your vision?! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world. well, they're welcome. but i want the grail itself. the cup that gives everlasting life. hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. i'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the dodo.  the grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
i just don't think it would work.
what the hell was that about --
boy, do i love this conflict. huh?... what the hell were you doin' in there?
how are you doing?
never should've let her play.
hi.  just checking to see if you're here.
fine, sir, fine.
now i think captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. in fact i think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
we've been over this a dozen times.  no.
will you help me, sandy?
what have you done?!
let me tell you guys a story. in one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois.
i got gas, bennie.
i never really thought i was part of the world you move in, sam, to tell you the truth.  i'm a hood, a thief.  big time in a small time king of way.  to the local police i'm a prize, to the local hoods i'm a legend.  but to a guy like you i'm just another two bit hired gun.
...yes.
i don't know.  i don't see what this has to do with me.
you keep them.
maybe we oughta find another place.
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that movie.
two-hundred thousand!
dad, adrian's got the whole city after me. he's always a step ahead. what am i gonna do?
not the whole thing, truman.  you were right about one thing.
watch it punk, i'm armed.
i came here before.
korea man is ok.  let's leave him alone.
all my life i have never reached a man. i knew that i would reach my husband, but i took my time and he was dead. ronny.
that's not what you said last night.
no.  that woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
it seemed appropriate.
ok. should i put my bike in the back of your car?
you are involved.  by being alive you're involved.
hey, 'top.'  what's the op?
...we're saved!
i had a hotel room.
tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
dr. carlson's dead?
mr. harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
terrific! a born stooge! horace'll perform like a trained seal.
but the thumb always works. different ways to do it, though. depends on how you feel. for instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  that shows independence. you don't care if they stop or not. 'cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
"take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
oh yes, oh that's great.
no,  sir.  it's more of a perceptual issue.
coffin?
what about luther?
absolutely not.  probably one or two hours.  four at the most.
that ' s completely adorable!
do you have any idea what my life is like?
why don't you back off?
look at it this way. he might achieve everything your son never did.
get control of yourself!
you know, me and stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
no one will be laughing at you now, ted. you can take that to the bank.
to women. they're all whores. let us not forget what chenowsky said. "the greatest men are the most alone." and without suffering, jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard.
thanks for the shirt.
a gun?  why -- to shoot, of course.
what's he doing daddy?
i want my mommy.  i don't want to lose you, clem.
yeah. i guess i did.  what's going to happen to me?
this time i was trying to do everything right.
well, mr. gardiner, that's just fine with me - i'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... be seated, please, mr. gardiner...
did you fear for your life?
exactly.  here. take it to the party instead of me.
it's just that i hate empty rooms.
they crashed it into a wall.  a flight <i>simulator</i>.
where is he?
oh...do you know when she'll be home?
mace... you're a girl.
oh, faith.  my name's faith.
who?
what? it's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
oh tsht. yes.
how many do you need to sleep. really sheep?
what you think, mozart, is scarcely the point. it is what his majesty thinks that counts.
what'd you say?
there ain't.
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
hey... !
atonement.
well, jeffries, why come to us about it?  why don't you go up to the houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
she said something about that, mrs. reed — but she didn't tell me it was the farren house. i'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
i thought i recognized you. saw you fight in st. nick's a couple of years ago.
they're real good.
stay where you are!
follow her.
now you're asking.
yeah.  he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia, but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - honey was killed...?  poor girl...
we'll never be the same.
a lincoln?  what lincoln?  lincoln continental?  lincoln mark five... six... ?
i've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. we should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
it's part of the hydrogalvanic system. the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
i don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hope's stool specimen.
you're making popcorn?
hi, i'm honey.
oh, tom, that was awful.
no one'll ever come here.  shut it down. don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. i'll take care of it.
you know, dear, i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. just tell us. we'll believe you.
i made it go down the toilet.
i think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
what! shit!
thank you, sir.  i will do that.
no.  i just kind of like the sound of it.
when he was seventeen.
yeah, i heard a lot about you.
i'm not exactly sure... it looks close. did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
joe or what?
four hundred and sixty, sir.
tape his mouth shut.
are you sure she wasn't there?  maybe she was just hiding from you.
we're not ready!
and these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
same here. i've watched you in action. very impressive.
will you be spending more than a night?
now i can do what i want.
actually, yeah--
hey!
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
the experiment. the danger...
oh, yes... i think...
she's got my vote.
she didn't see you, in other words.
see the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of seti the first, i'm sure of it.
your father worked in a mannequin factory?
we'll walk.  and if we have to, we'll starve.
how could you vouch for me? that's...  ... arrogant presumption -
it's okay...it's okay baby. cry for mama. cry for mama.
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
wait a minute. the fight. where did he get you?
faith, here it is. i think it best you marry with this paris. o, he's a lovely gentleman. i think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
let's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us.
so i guess you're not going.
do whatever you want with it.  i don't care.  all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
she didn't do it again did she?
you know what, claude? this whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. that plan with your cousin, did that include me?
if ever i saw a sign from heaven!
goodnight, malcolm.
and if i use them to kill you?
please get to your father and send him and the police to dorothy's apartment right away. be sure your father comes. something is happening over there. they're hurting someone, the guy she loves. tell them to hurry. i'm going over right now.
no. it's because you don't know how they died.
sally there's a whole world out there.  we can have a new home. a real home, not some tin-plated dump.  what are you giving up?
i think so.
they did too!
no. no! calvin, this is different! believe me!
gently, ott.  gently.
...bottega.  guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, i think he's a ballplayer.  you?  definitely clarence darrow.
...insulting people who were in the camps. ...what's the point?
why?
look. maybe this isn't going to work. maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
you pull up -- collect your first installment.  then you let the daughter go.  when she reaches me, i'll dump out another third.  same action.  i back up again -- you pull forward.  satisfy yourself it's there.  then we do it one last time.  the final exchange. and we go our separate ways.
well... yes, quite possibly.
yes, your honor. had you ever gotten a perm before, miss windham?
sure it is, sid. it's all a movie. life's one great big movie. only you can't pick your genre.
yes.
what was the motive?
i've run out of words.
alan!
thank you, colonel... i'm afraid i don't know your name.
why, i turned them down, naturally.
you know why?  she was so -
then i mislay my checkbook--
i like you, wally, so i'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
now turn around.  i'm going to cuff you.
mike. no thanks, i'm fine.
commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having. in "the quasar dilemma", the sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
you must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
horseshit.
mars, watch the cops!  kevin!  watch the back of the house!
it was my ass that almost got trashed!
it better be fifteen minutes, because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
man overboard!
is that how you get most of your dates? someone gives your name to someone else?
if you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
shall i wash these out?
i want this ship searched from bow to stern. lieutenant saavik, you are in charge. start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
oh no, it's been much more than that.
you just don't get it, do your reggie?  there isn't any deal. i own your ass.
you know i'm doin' well now. and i'm gonna do even better. and so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, i'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. and if there are kids, especially, you know, i'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
he wrote me a nice deposition. he says he just received the drugs. you did the selling.
i was getting to it.
yeah ...
.. we got a body part. we don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. o.k. now you know as much as we do ..
what show ?
what could possible be funny?
cavity search...?
but i'm the woman in the mirror!
well, i'll tell you why i ask. you see, i've got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, i'm a little concerned about her.
you used that excuse to get out of the army.
so what else is new?  look eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for tamara mason. wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
so am i.
i'm a boy - i'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i'm a boy - i'm a boy -  what am i going to do about my engagement present?
i don't back down.
i still am.
just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
watch it, shithead!
i called dan koretzky because he --
was i? no... not by a bolshevik!
i can never get a way from it.
you know, it really is beautiful up there.  let me show you.  we'll take a walk after dinner.
what does that mean, frank? i don't get it. why?
why not?
stephanie! stop!
why didn't you tell me this before?
is your family in the apple business, too?
it would take a minute or so.  you won't last that long out there.
a very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
i got an overcoat on.
same one.
we don't know anything about it
it's a cocktail.  mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
now wuddya suppose is eatin' george?
i don't know.
sounds delightful. who the fuck is john malkovich?
we're going all the way on this one, frank.  tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
so, what happened?
seemed, not was.
what the hell's a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister's?
nope.
why not?
... and stay outta here.
i see.
money -- ever heard of it?
you aren't going to hurt me.  you aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
yeah.
the safety circuit's failed!
how can you store an energy field within you?
the best.
you ever do any hunting, peter?
um... juno, can i -- can i touch it?
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
oh, come now... we're all creatures of god and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
oh, let's not talk about it.
now i want you to be absolutely, totally, genuinely honest with me. did you really, truly, honestly like it?
no. i never was.
that's a hell of a thing to say. why, rose?
they never caught on.
hello?
you never know.  go get some sleep.
look at these. what are these?
nine-thirty, mr. preysing keeps us waiting.
mr. president, hunt wants more money. another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
what the hell you doing here?
who's robbin' who here, gabriel...
what's she saying?
i should like to change into a sunflower most of all. they are so <u>tall</u> and simple. and you, harold, what flower would you like to be?
our expenses?
then have my lips the sin that they have took.
i did not.  now get out of my way!
well...small world. well, then, you know firsthand how hollywood does things. lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
shane's going as a condom.
yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  we risk our whole operation for nothing.  i'll say when we make our bets.
how'd it go?
honey, have they offered you the job?
with a little checking, i could get to believe you.
this is it, gents. my ma told me to head south past that rock.
okay.  i think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
felt promising. it's a start.
sir, i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview.
what is it?
look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
not so scared.
he doesn't miss a trick, does he?
i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
i don't think we're ready.
maybe that's why you can't catch him.  i <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
this vacuum don't work.  where's the restroom?
oh come on. quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
-- right after i sprayed her?
what'd he say?
you see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. i want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
chauncey! chauncey!
nope.
want some bridge mix?
just find the girl, mr. gittes. i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her. i'd like to help her if i can.
what are you talking about?
eve is going to stay. the house will not be closed.
now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. got it? like this.
s.r. hadden...  you compromised our security codes.
i'm nervous, too.
well. i have no way of knowing. so it doesn't matter.
they payin'?
it's so pretty.
good -- like i said, take your pick.
and now i want you.
can we see it from the back yard?
you seem mighty collected about this.
i've been going to debtor's anonymous.  you want to see some truly fucked up people?
oh, tell the story.
when?
see, i'm going home.
it's gino!  it's gino!
if they are?
yeah, i'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. there's nothing else.
can you configure it?
no, he's working on another book.
i don't know.
what do you mean by that?
you know him?
how are you today?
ball games! don't break my heart! i wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the polo grounds. so you got a brother. well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin johnny gets mustard on his face at the polo grounds. if i was you—  — listen, i'm not asking you to do anything, terry. it's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
we were overdue to get hit.
mom, dad. meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. he's what you'd call clinically bummed.
wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, i can't explain it, but i've seen it.
probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
okay, we're back in.
looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
me too.
who is the greatest man you can think of?
yeah, since i was a kid.  i had a woodwork class once when i was... in school that time.  then i learned a lot more when i was in the --
get some more beer.
rose, i don't --
sure.
you're looking very chipper this morning, rose. sow do you feel?
the pumps --
just hand up on the bitch!  fuck you, madam.  and goodbye!
mrs. hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. you'll love my grandma rosa.
it's grace.
she likes you.
our decision. together.
that was nice of mr. galbraith.
yeah.
first, i plan to soil myself. then, i plan to regroup and think about the next move. any thoughts?
a moment ago you said you didn't want to see the porter.
homer, you know i would never kill anyone--you know i wouldn't.
don't get me wrong. a couple years ago, i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. but the lord's been good to me. i can now finance any films i choose. big ones, small ones. right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. live sound. i like to keep my own money in my films. that way you don't have to share the profits. there's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. but if i was you, mr... what was your name again?
down there.  just down there.  a helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, buzz!
suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. it's my house, you know.
you were planning to send me back to the ice house.  you set me up.
how'm i gonna relax standing on a mine!?
mmm, what?
you got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
a load, if i may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
i guess you're right...  that is, if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay!
...so rich?
i'll need to know more about this thing.
about forty minutes.
on the square, jimmy, if you'd seen winton down there -- i'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
we're only going to get one shot at this. target their primary reactor. with any luck, their warp core should implode.
there you go, talking like a woman!
what's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
thanks, tatum.
do you like that?
i should've told you it was the blood of christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
nothing. don't go, craig. i've been thinking. let's try to work this out. we've got so much history.
does this thing have guns, john parker?
we should tell him we're not going.
--no--
i'm in a motel. has something happened to del? did he do something stupid?
and you, what do you like?
she from scotland too?
we're on vapor, cougar, you got to put it down.
hullo lad. what a surprise, good to see you.
thanks you, knights who say ni!  you are fair and just.  we will return with a shrubbery.
would it have helped if i'd knocked him down?
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
no! i don't want to leave you!!
can you use a new suit for christmans?
she knew she could beat it.  that's why she asked to take it.
you don't forget love, honey.  not ever.
uh...uh... mounties.  the mounties guard the border. uh... those mountie hats.
what the fuck do you want?
what's the point?
then for god's sake, harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
oh, please. i hope you're not going to run away this time.
the broad has disappeared...
there's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... you know what you gotta do -- ?
two days, we got two days! don't do nothing. don't touch nothing --
extremely clever.
oh, right.  friday.
"graverobbers from outer space"! it's <u>money in the bank</u>.
come on.
they are rare...  ... orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
which is?
thanks for coming by.
he's mistaken.
i worry for you.
i have no idea.
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before. jesus christ! <u>you</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? i guess i should have hired a professional.
i'm going to stretch my legs
yeahhhh. i'm sorry. i just got so excited about... your present.
we are passing through the bassen rift. the projections will return when we have cleared it.
that's because you had a proper upbringing.
alright, go help chris shovel up the last of the crap.
we're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
you're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
i see.  may i?
i -- saw no future --
god!  it looks like the army!
i said he hadn't written me.
it should.  you nominated him for spec-recon just three days after you nominated me.
what plan?
fuck you.
tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
them's the keys. all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' english bob can ride out free as birds.
so why this ?
i don't know.
dixie's waiting at the infirmary. she'll put a splint on that injured leg.
what's the matter, jules?  trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
when is she supposed to return?
right, the emperor. now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
okay, let's go through what happened. we're in the place, everything's going fine. then the alarm gets tripped. i turn around and all these cops are outside. you're right, it was like, bam! i blink my eyes are they're there. everybody starts going apeshit. then mr. blonde starts shootin' all the -
but you lived.
i'm getting paid...
we're upstairs, george. now come on. behave yourself, and for christ's sake, do me a favor. don't let me drink too much.
this is going too far, young man.
you're also a human being, frank.
oh yes, yes.
you didn't take it before. you didn't take it the time after that. and now, you didn't take it again?
are you the hillary mitchell who went to school with maggie muldovan?
a joint interview, eh? that might be all right. we could have our pictures taken together, doctor.
harry's missing.
i'm not kidding.
jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
are you guys all right?
but don't you dare say that.
i know what it sounds like.
--you're a cop.
don't feel too bad.  mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  you're better off out of it.
...no....
you don't own this man!
i'm needing lunch.
it wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, i guess.
why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  i am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
hey! you know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
script coverage?
i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out!
who's staring?
mom -- is there something wrong with mr. carpenter?
what else is there to do?
a god?
until now.
if you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
what else you got?
about what?
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
that's it...?    come on, guys...life is too short...  you tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    frank:  i don't think i'm talking out of school, but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if i may say, you haven't got the best of records.
and we won't stretch up our arms...
ha. did he say why?
curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  mother's love, jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  it's bad luck!
and she's all wrong for me!
he told me last night.
gimme the ball!
i'm boring?
well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
i took your husband's buick...  i'll return it tomorrow.
so what?
verbal, i know you know something. i know you're not telling us everything.
yeah, well, i'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
you live with it... and they haunt you. it doesn't leave.
holy shit.
hello, tom.
i have helm control.
after you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
yup.
how long are we going to stay?
you've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
it is, isn't it? and maybe it's a break for me after all. i've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now i'm out. i can make a clean start, and --
i'm not. he does walk funny. don't you see that?
you mean it'll be difficult.
my parents are having friends from college over. they're really nice... they have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
buddy told me about that thing at cao ben?
don't blow it, elliot. he's bluffin'. he just told you so himself.
lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.
ask me when we get home.
okay, i think i could swing that.
looks like a tie.
yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
well, how would you define to parties"? because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session--
okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
you open?
and that's great.  but do it in la and new york!  there you experiment! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  i don't care!
those newspaper people?
i know.
what i asked you earlier?
we want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
i'm fine peggy sue. and how are you? are we talking on the phone? are we pen pals?
i don't think we need any keys, dignan. i think i can hotwire a car for us.
... one thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... what's the world's record for this?
alright... turn around. she doesn't get shit, unless i get that money. where is it?
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
the young girl runs by a window. she looks in. a ghost masked killer stares back. the figure crashes through the window attacking her. she fights him off, getting away, running...
i'm listening.
come on, blade.  talk to me!
oh my god! you're at southglen south? they have a killer baseball team.
the food will make you feel bedder. look at me -- i'm da happiest guy i know!
[how does it work?]
did you say..."peggy"?
what is wrong with me?
is that what you want me to be?
i am a princess.  you have no right to order me about.
and what happened?
walter, i'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
explain noises.
i...
bobo won't be. he'll spend the money to make sure.
the old man wants you; johnny's here...he's got a problem.
we're just having a little drink.
who are you?  what the fuck do you want?
and the underground garage one.  would i know him?
looks like a diner.
we stop at pancakes hause.
i buy my shirts by the dozen. fortunately.
what?
gentlemen of the "enquirer"!  this has, i think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  mr. reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. it will make them happy to learn that the "enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
listen, i have no time for this. i've heard this shit before! so lets get on with it!
north -- in an arroyo, shot through the head —- maybe week ago. no good, skin, everything gone ——
if he arrives before us, it will be too late.
you're american.  i thought so. from your teeth -- the dental work --
i had this weird flash just then.
i did.  what's the matter?  don't trust me?
i don't need your gratitude.
aren't you ever going to get married?
good. lemonade it is.  i'm paul.
our habitat, i mean.  this place can't handle another attack.
lil was wearing a sour face.
that's right.
it is dead.
thanks, miz wilkes, but i don't want to take up any more of your time. i best be going.
what? i'm a pawn shop rocker.
sir!... might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munro's daughters? i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort.
by all means, knock yourself out.
she's ready.
unwelcome.
yeah.
hydrophobia...
i'm not interested.  i want to create my own material.
we'll be back tonight.
sheriff--hi--this is sergeant--this is priscilla worth.
...junk!
take off your hat.
somewhere in this city.  not here, not here.  tell penelope i loved her--in my clownish way.  and paul. tell him to be a healer, by all means.
of course.
the head man's writing a bill.
in whatever way you think i mean.
let me get this straight. we drove all the way down to klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
i can't just leave. i have a life here, a career --
quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
yes.
i'm in town for a short time.
you done?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it.
makin' friends already.
never?
frankie, johnny wants to say goodnight.
could i have a cigarette?
a satellite dish?
dr. gruber's not in.
city hall?
we're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
hey, what's your problem?
and you have no idea where he lives?
elle, do you know what happened on "days of our lives" yesterday?
watchers?
listen to me!  he's been going on and on about mars.  he's really been there.
who is jesus?
i'm glad you came.
so you've grasped the idea.  con- gratulations.  now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.
what?
it's stupid, of course.
it is.
you look good, bunny. it's nice to see you.
have you seen willie?
hmmm, a lesbian, are you? i must inform you that i find that highly arousing.
i'm a writer. ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on.
is that kid still bothering you?
silicon valley?
nice club, mr. gekko...
did you hear that?
it's john, isn't it?
what are you talking about?
yeah, he can go ...
i'm glad you're so certain, alex. it makes us feel a whole lot better.
there ! there ! did you see ! they're still alive !
for a start. i just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
i can see that, what're they for?
of course i don't want you to bring it up to him... but if it comes up...
fight. you know.
do you have it in you, lee?  or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
do you think he set me up? do you think that was his intention?
the gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
he found out his partner, tan, had been working for the triads all along.  before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
i'm falling apart, that's funny?
i don't have your number.
okay.
your line of work.  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
the red hair... it's bad luck.
rico then, at least call me rico in my own goddam place.
no  hell, some secretary in new york just hands it to you. only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
just one question.  please.
i'm getting high readings near the air vents.  it must be using the duct system to get around.  see, i told you we'd get something.
sure--there was a bad accident there.  they showed the pictures on t.v.
blocked at every turn.  beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
and the brocketts?
hi.
why you always gotta embarrass me? i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
well, i've got eyes, haven't i? why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
she's tough.
you're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
can you stand something to eat?
get comfortable.  the bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  the worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
that never seemed to worry you at the glades.
how come ya wanna hang out with those guys? they teach ya bad things.
what happens if they don't do that?
what? i just said hello. since when i can't kiss my sister-in-law?
you're being served with a subpoena, mr. malloy.
damn! we gotta skedaddle!
if ever i need a boss, joe.
doesn't work that way.  you had your chance, now fuck yourself...
uh, mrs. swicker i got to meet some friends later, and i have to take a shower!
how's that?
if the un changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
well, it's probably nothing. i'm just spooked since... you know.
we are the choices we've made, robert.
maybe he's gay.
i can't help it.  i can't stop him from anything.
my father was looking for the holy grail. did you kill him too?
remember what i said, you can't...
hey.  a new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  i told him we'd be out there thursday.
as a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  you'll have to excuse me.
who is your user, program?
all right guys... uh... gwen and i are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. fred, you and guy need to get that air valve back on.  alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case fred and guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
it's the kids, you know, not jeremy. he had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. he's always willing to pay. he's extremely generous.  i'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
we can't kill it on board.  it's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
i hope she's all right.  how much more do i have to do of this?
what are you afraid of?
little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. dig out this hole a little.  cmon, i know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
every young man should at least once...go on, laurie! read!
ah, you young folks don't know how it is. how is gideon today?
yes i do!
well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us.  just the dentist tomorrow.
...hello?
i had to sneak by the guards to get here. they say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
for this one, we need $60,000.
and i don't want any more wild turkey, either.  it's burning a hole in my stomach.
...motherfuckah, motherfuckah, i'm too short to be dealing with this shit! they keep fucking with us man, no letup...
oh, i'm so glad.
why not?
there they are.  no herd though.
wait a minute -- you think those three men killed charles, don't you?
you told her?
you know how long it took the "chronicle" to get that staff together?  twenty years.
uhh -- yeah --
oh, how did you get burnt-out?
sure, i'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. which branch of the service?
to <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  what one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
you looked right at her, baby.
come on!
that's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
rowan...
nothin. quit lookin' at me like that!
oh, i'm used to it. what makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  they ought to be grateful to have you.  i certainly am.
-- let's check that interpol window again --
let's go peep from the living room.
what?
why do you want a room here?
well hi vanessa! what brings you to the mall today?
no doubt.
that's what i said.
shit!
let my susie rest in peace!
stop.  you experimented in college. i don't want to hear about that.
we shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
really?  you're the best.
daddy?
easy, tiger.  come by after school. i'll leave darryl with the sitter.
if i were you, sefton, i'd eat that egg some place else. like for instance under the barrack.
yes -- what is it?
it will be rough.
duffy! i'm sending bensinger over to see you.  mervyn, isn't it?
well, you did break out --
what with?
major burns is far from satisfied.
i'm retired.
jefferson dropped in for a minute, susan.
can't you use something else?
way out of anything, man. just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm will turn. how many days you short?
nope.
his name is andrew. i know that guy.
i had everything. once.
the master is not yet married.  nor do i think he ever will be.  we are simply his servants.
buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
i don't believe this! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell i am!
then what do you want to do, miles? run?
how do you say nineteen?
just got the call.  took him from school.  bastard nailed the vice- principal and a teacher.
where's little bill for christ sake?
hi. sorry about that.
are those just button buttons or...?
this is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
oh. how did it happen?
then don't let me get cornered, max. you don't have the trunk space.
who said i was going?
they'd never sail this close to the shore.
that's too bad.
when i'm ready to compare notes, i'll let you know.
it's nice there.  he's probably digging every minute.  got a surfboard.  breaking girls' hearts.
we are in a dungeon. how do we get out?
bloody peasant! 
two negatives always make a positive.
yes.
we can't talk inside either?
why?
thank god for bunge cords.
i can't control mine- i'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  what right did then have to show up here?
are you crazy?  you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
you ain't gettin' in no trouble, i hope.
hello, bomb, are you with me?
okay, price. you stay.
i can't trust you!
don't bother.
shoulda' felt up tammy in the pool, that time...
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you're the one always saying 'just do it'.
z!  over here!
thanks.
what are you spying on?
what's landon carter up to?
how's the clock, bandit ii.
charlie, this is business.
for now.  are you planning to go back to new york?
...no...
... it was like... the minute i saw her... i knew.  she looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
you're living.
my dear, young man, don't take it too hard. your work is ingenious. it's quality work. and there are simply too many notes, that's all. cut a few and it will be perfect.
what's that?
corporate fingerprints all over it.
you're in gun country now, my friend.
midge!
adorable. what time are they supposed to be here?
it may have been affected.
segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  switch to another station, huh? you're driving me crazy with that.
not yet.
jack crawford is helping your career, isn't he? apparently he likes you. and you like him, too.
thanks for taking over.
no, he's very upset about something.
we'll take the royal suite!
so what do you do?
apparently, i was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. when i came to, i didn't know who i was, where i was, or where i came from. luckily, i had my driver's license or i wouldn't even know my name. i hoped it would tell me where i lived but it had a tallahassee address on it, and i stopped somebody on the street and they told me i was in detroit. so that was no help. but i did have some money on me, so i hopped in a cab until i saw somethin' that looked familiar. for some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. so i told him to stop and i got out.
oh, christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
he's missing.  he's gone.  he left.
because my mother was dying! but now she's not.
this must be very new.
he was actually there? you saw him?
me, i'm proud to be a jew, i got no problem. you don't like it, fuck you. but with these guys it's like a dirty word. all they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good american and a jew. so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0. selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's irish for fuck's sake--
no.
yes.
what did you think of lippman's column this morning?
yeah, your little cootchie knew.
i have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  d'you understand that?
he will fight you forever. but what does he fight for? freedom first, and peace. so grant them.
father, will you please explain what's going on?
rough?
you!  are you the mother of that child?
yeah?
i'm lost.  goodbye.
i know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata. not bad at all.  are you expecting someone?
you coulda stayed at bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
but a week. that's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
you are?
he's not crazy.
look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
just don't believe everything you see.
shut your mouth and drive!
can we get him to the hospital?
i'm sorry, honey. but the birds will still be there next week.
you’re a long way from home...
listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... what are you shootin'?
yes!
luke!  luke, something's wrong! the film broke, and i can't raise harry on the house phone!
i was not.
something else i want to try.
if you're possessed, you can't reveal anything satan wants hidden.  unless you trick him.
you're going to have a bachelor party?
april 14, 1912.
what's she doing?
let me look.
so why do you stay?
yes. i was there with ben.
you don't know what you're talking about.
that's the guy.
i need your car, elizabeth.
in there.
some people fall apart in a pinch. but you shine.
i was driving a white van.  it must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned.  it was...horrible.
peanut butter.
no.  no -- actually, let's make ike the pastor.
and they got penny!  look!
you're sure going to be poison to that junior leaguer[4] from now on!
<i>you drove lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the dmv. why?</i>
i'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council. and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
will they free me?
so, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, mr. rather's been complaining about his chair again.  as they start to leave...
it stings a little.
can't you pull that stocking down further, kenny?
so you saw oswald how many times?
jack... forgive me...
she told you that?
die?  what...?
we understand.
but you didn't.
yeah.
i never joke about waiving a client's sixth amendment right to trial.
like what?
oh-oh! touché, mr lombard! but tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  no. don’t. you might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
mr. fairlane, i'm very rich.  the kind of rich that warps minds. nothing offends me.  when i was eleven, i walked in on my father and the shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. does that excite you?
agent mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
it could be.
barks at the mention of food. licks his lips.
and this is helen carter.
isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
working.  charlie and i were going over some statements.
we can reach an understanding on this.
very well, your majesty.  congratulations, frank. he picked you.
clarence.
oh billy... please... god...
you've been drinking. your tipsy.
he sees himself in me! romeo montague, a young man of verona.
my god, what do you think?
perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
why know?
i'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
oh... i guess i'll die now.
why wasn't the ship protected?!?! why was it sailing without radar?
his wife took a trip.
fine. and a couple of bottles of dom perignon. to cabana one.
no. but you're in very big trouble.
tennessee someplace. hill country.
teh... tehronne?
naw, man. they just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
the table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
what kind of man are you?
sat for an artist.  been sketched.
but i thought vampires didn't like the light.
there's the script to go back to the guild-
you know, these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats, but they're right up there.
i've already asked them. they're afraid to make the trip. we'll have to send an expedition back after them.
that's me.
stop!  stop!  i don't need the money.  you can have it all.
think of it... as a threesome. you. me. and... "jethro."
oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
look, listen to me.  a woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  i have been walking for three days!  i don't want to spell my name, i want you to give me this jeep!
he waited for you three hours!
you really want to do this, don't you?
look. you know that and i know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. i think it's that bozo, hanrahan, i can't be sure. anyway, unless i go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
it's a helluva disease.
something wrong?
zion?
of bodies.
alright. she's staying with some friends of her parents. the o'sheas. she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central.
hold it down, nick!
what do you mean? it's wonderful. really, it's - it's marvelous! people love me here.
your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday, she's available.
sorry i didn't let you know where i was.
now listen carefully. stan and kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. if any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
he's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
what 'emotion'? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
that's usually my line.
no, i mean, i don't know. i can't really think of much to say probably.
how does he breathe?
no! what are you -- you're serious about this?
a thousand.  you have made me guardian of scotland. so i tell you this is what we face.
why did you break into that particular building?
yes, isn't he.
i'd be in tahoe having fun if you had given up.
so you don't love him. you wouldn't say you --
come on, jake. that didn't hurt.
why?  what happened?
mr. gardiner, i have a telephone call for you. sidney courtney, the financial editor of the washington post.
she's fine.
tom prinze, tanked as usual. that's a shocker.
i saw mr. faber.  you remember mr. faber, don't you?
i had a feeling you would say something like that. so i brought us dinner.
fuck this shit!
you want us to give you a ride?
thank you.  no.  here...
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'we will bake cookies first,' she said.  'i have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' and she pushed gretel toward the oven. the witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  dylan, this is too violent.  i don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
some women like dobermans --
surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
what?
what?
anthony, give me the fucking gun!
gentlemen, the past.  unfolding before your eyes.  stand back from the field.  it'll blow you to bits.
on earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire. we can handle the son'a, i'm not worried about that...
i'm giving him his ring back.
is that what i did?  dave?  i humiliated you?  my god...i'm sorry...
frederick's done this whole new series that i'm sure you would really love.
that's what i'm saying, will. you'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
what's wrong?
now margo, don't overreact.  cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  my leaving makes perfect sense.  this isn't exactly early retirement.  i've overstayed the party a bit.
i know. it's awful, isn't it? night of the living cheerleaders.
that's true.
it's the only frontier i have left, plumcake.
i read the file. yeah. marx and towler. i know who they were.
going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
whose "catcher in the rye" is this?
no, in your...ear piece. you have a lovely smile . can you hear me now?
aw, leave him alone paul, he's back, isn't he? and it's not his fault he's old.
so you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  it happened!  the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america!  who the fuck are you to bury this?!
and last, but not least, adolph... you know who.
stens?  was it stens?
hey, you know what i really think?
this is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
they're on the bridge. seal off the 50th floor!
this must be one of the old keys -
you walked home.
and i couldn't follow her.  god knows i tried.  one doesn't often get a second chance. i want to stop being haunted. you're my second chances, judy.
all in all, quite a canoe...
you made a mistake.
i mean, what is there to be happy about really? i mean, going to the gym, climbing the stairmaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. sometimes i just want something different, you know?
no.
see you tuesday, frank.
dr. grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
what do i got for you?
good.
look after him.
why do you get to choose?  why don't i get to choose?
well you figured wrong!  and now i'm public enemy number one.  you have an answer for that?
petty good.
and to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
well, that about covers everything.
alexander, i know your theory. the boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
aren't you meeting mr. sheldrake?
damnit, spock. god damnit!
... yer ducts.
he knows what he's doing.  he's worn before... a lot.
correct.
i used to.  with my old man.  he taught me how to hunt and trap.  trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  we used to go after raccoons mostly. they'd get into our garbage, our fields.  when an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  but they're crafty little devils.  you see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  you ever smell raccoon scent?  smells like shit, but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy.  he'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it.  you know why?  cause he can't help himself.  the scent drives him.  so, if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
yeah, so i hear. don't you think you should go get changed?
sure - i think so, stew.
i'm not using him again for anything.  he was worthless.  you have bridge here saturday?
"don't write any checks you can't cash."
confidential, like.
well, thanks a lot.
not that.
kimberly!
tell her i'm very happy with it.
you want somethin'?
i know, i know!  i'm a terrible person...  it's... i'm so damn, damn sad.
wow, you must a found the c.o., eh?
i'm saying, we're just friends.
amish.
what...?
i have to finish first.
i'm sorry. it seems every hour i have to...
about what?
it always amazes me, lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
life and death matter. yours-- everyone's.  by comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
cuervo jones' right-hand man. one tough hombre. you don't understand, snake. cuervo jones wants to unify the island. we're on the move, man. big time.
can you help <u>me</u>?
tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  jerry alongside. the quarterback sucks, man.  he's gonna get me killed.
mr. scott, how soon can we get underway?
i'm sorry, but i just can't see you veggin' out in la-la land.
was that your chapter, then?  it was very good.
what?!?
i'm sorry, george.
i want to be here.  in this time.  with you.  i want to become...become a whole person.  i want this to be the present. i want the future to be unknown.
just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
shut up.
well, that'll be the first time.
what's going on?
oh, it's not so bad. i have two wonderful kids, my own business.  still, knowing what i know now, if i had the chance to do it all over again, i'd sure do things a lot differently.
yes i'm sorry.
let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
i wish i could, rebecca, but i can't let you.
well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and i'll focus on the molecular physics.  or, uhm, maybe i should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
what?  johnny, what's wrong?
do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
by the way, james: ordinarily i would never ask, but... weren't you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea?
well i'm sorry. before...
beth.
general, would you mind making my excuses at our table? i'll be back in a few moments.
tell us about it.
do you like this, salieri?
kinda like david and what's-his-name?
i have to go to venice.
b-but i have them.
how did you know that?
it isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
that was a pity...
what?
dr. bright, i don't have to do anything.
thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
wait a minute. what does the chairman do?
you should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  these lips can be murder.
i am the walrus.
is there someplace we can talk?
hi.  i hope i'm not disturbing...
it's not so bad these days. kids like joint custody. two sets of toys.
i said i have illegitimate children. i don't know how many.
you working?
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
what?
no, nothing's like it used to be.
yeah, but you know horrace. what did you get off him?
hey, rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
i know.
what the hell does that do?
[yes.]
well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
we'll beam aboard and stop it --
there's only three weeks left of summer, michael.  things are going to change around here when school starts.
aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. there's only one other thing wrong with you.
i know what you mean. but it doesn't put me in too great a position...
no way, jude. i'm out.
we don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
do you have something to drink?
an attempted slit.
i think you been stayin' up too late at night, homer.
that wasn't her toe.
eight o'clock. shit. you'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
...  so you see in a former lifetime i'm sure that i was alexandria, the czarette of russia? what do you think?
i'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
no, i'm here. where are you?
you can't go now.
either side you idiot. i'm calling 911.
jimmy, where do you find these people?
yes.
we didn't think this through very well.
where's sam?
ronnie. you can't see cuz you're too close to it.  these nervous spells you get. you never had that shit back in school...
if you'll excuse me......
i think sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
ain't got no courthouse.  courthouse burnt down, 1960.
we know what's going on.
how?
i'm jill. i really like your show. i think you're great.
fucker hit into us.
he can't.  the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and x-ray machines.
by the way, i'm a real manchurian.
but where is my daddy!?
in case you die, too?
but if he said no before then...
they are?  come on.
yeah, sure, and i bet you had lobster last night. along with two bottles of champagne.
my cousin is the harbor master. you must not bring in drugs.  you cannot be armed.  if you're carrying, it has to go.  or stow it inside.  no one will go near your boat...
town police.
i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st. bernard's. we're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
'bout 4:30.
i got used to...thinking of them. as...my kids too.
okay, good. she's asleep.
yes. i'll meet you at grand central at noon. okay. do me. i command you.
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them...
thanks.
yes. that's the duomo, seen from the belvedere. do you know florence?
very nice. what is it?
bully for you.
slim jim? apple? yogurt? you like yogurt.
ted, i'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. now i want you to level with me: did you knock this skirt up?
they call me swede.
i'm afraid you have to eat something.
get `em ready.  you... come with me.
what is working around here?
that's not all, frances. mr. bebe is very concerned about your politics. he hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
you've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. no living human has ever seen this machine.  but why? why even in my twilight years would i remotely consider sending someone back in time?
should i let her in like - ?
what?
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
you're so nice.
you're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
you cannot! not for the queen herself!
you're such a smart aleck! nobody can do anything but you. i'll show you how to stop a car—and i won't use my thumb.
thanks for the fresh air. that felt good.
i imagine it would, yes.  so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties.
sit down and stop being such a child.
well, that changes everything. get the fuck away from me!!  i mean it!!
what about swann's miracles?
you're parents at that party?
what about--
mind, now! keep don quixote out of here!
yessir. i'm sorry.
you're a hard man to trust, sir. you sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
well, she was.
i'm going back inside.
ow!  watch where you're going!
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow i doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
emily.  just kidding.
you think that?
he will learn patience.
well, good. woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
fat lou, we're changing courses for the solaras space lab.
harvard. the harvard business school.
what-what-i don't... it's not natural! we're sleeping in a bed together. you know, it's been a long time.
yeah.
where are you going?
well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
this is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
yes... that's what i pray for...!
buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
sort of a trial balloon.
i do.
what do you want?
she told you about...
please, raoul.  i can give you stars, i know i can.  just drop the safe on my head one more time.
you got yourself a ship.  we can leave as soon as you're ready.
don't say it.  we're both ragged out right now.
...who let you in?
yeah. i'm not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?
is it safe?
don't get angry at me.  maybe you just need a day job.
the kitchen.
i don't have a girl.
no, he was a schoolteacher. but he liked to dabble.
now that the war is over, enzo, this boy is being repatriated to italy.  and you see, godfather...  he...my daughter...they...
you missed the last three, including her birthday.  your wife's gripe sheet.

then why are you not with him?
the best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. have you ever led trackers?
nothing wrong.
dad!
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
that's sherry vanhafton.
hi there.
ow!
sit tight, diz. the show commences in just a minute.
ever since christmas, you've been different.  kind of distracted, distant.  but i feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
then it was not a sin. but what was that second thing you said, loretta?
all right, it's a matter of death.
know what?
it's you up on that stage, not him. you don't need him.
what are you talkin' about?  we just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  we can do anything we want now.
american.
must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
why... yes.
i am making out the report now. we haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
i'll need system four converters.
listen, callaghan.
then you tell me, then.
that's why i'm crying.
figure it out.  you got plenty of time.
no -- keep it.
now what was your news, baxter?
brandon, i remember you from the convention, right?... you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and i spoke sharply to you...
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  there's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
fifteen thousand.
hello?
yes?
it wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, i guess.
the witch?
sure.  sure.
no wait. let me try to get this out. you're amazing... and i know i have nothing to offer you, rose. i know that. but i'm involved now. you jump, i jump, remember? i can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
"one: please don't smoke in bed."
they're losing one mother.  they can't lose two.
how about we go somewhere else?
now slide the nylons off one by one.
what makes you so sure this will work?
but incidentally, let me tell you, <u>i</u> don't like <u>you</u>. i don't like you at all!  i wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
joe, i'm with drew.
then what?  that's it.  that's all i got.
why?
you hear that? anything we want. anything...well???
'cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. he doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. he uses you to get a line on ordell, make a case, then take him federal. you know what ordell's into?
all right, i'll go up there and take care of this myself.  you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.
i fucked up, frankie. i fucked up good this time. should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
i hate the mets.
no, that's true.
but really, you never know.
we're not dropping it. now that's the reason, isn't it? i'm a dirty degenerate, aren't i? i'm not fit to --
hold it.  whoa... what's your name, son?
i know you do, darling.
baby, this is what we came for. we met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
where the hell are we?
yes... and you are?
where is it?
i had some players to see and hands to shake.
need me for what, mama? i'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
cease, can i ask you something?
this old guy -- he's the kind of person i expected to meet when i moved out here.  someone who's done things with his life.
was there never ambition?
dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
objection, we've...
i thought you were done?
i was just asking...
me, i'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana, colorado, idaho. but did he ever think to organize the women? no. wives don't count in the anglo locals either.
did you hear something?
because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  an' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. so some on.
four.
they are... friends of congress.
does it matter?
for god's sake peter, leave her out of it.  you don't want her, you want me.
mitch...
well, still the same old place then, eh?
what do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
okay. i think that's it. he rises and walks to the door.
you're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
he's got more sense than you have. thank heaven you're not on this case.
i aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause i got it like dat.
larry!
i...i don't know what i did...
then do it.
you're a hell of a flyer.  you can be my wingman any time.
c'mon, jordan.  do the headwork with me.
where is he?
where's your shell collection?
what is?
really?
now we kill two birds at one stroke. we recruit from scotland for our armies in france.
mm-hm.
thank you, sir. thank you. i promise i will repay you.
i put a cigarette out in it.
so could i. and i'm a poor businessman.
you been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
i have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. now i know you won't be able to get it out, but i'm good for it.  i need that money.  can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and i'll pay you back?  please, i'm desperate.
i have not understood what you means.
no -- never.
i want to know why you see him. is it a patchett payoff?
regulations, mr. stanwyk. and you and your wife, named....
fifteen years, although i prefer the term "assassin."
who is it?
let’s go, jock.
i want to work this.
what's this?
thank you.
i've taken the spear for a lot of people, sway. including you. can't we improvise a little here ... ?
are you calling stan?
who are you?
that's a fine chick.
i'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  you guys get to the memorial.   keep this stuff hidden.  the last thing we need is some over-zealous secret service twirp to...
you locked yourself in.
fought?  come on, pete, you ran the px at fort dix.
how is that good news?
if i were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.
don't. think bailey.
i'll be stayin' overnight at... the airport howard johnsons!
stop talking like that!
i know, but...
i can't afford stuff like this right now.
i don't know that -- neither do you.  this subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
thank god...
then speak, by god!  can you fight with words?
okay.. .we're done, man....
you gonna steal my truck?
will you keep feeding me?  how long can you live like that?  until it kills you?  until i kill you? without your blood i'll go back.
get to work.
but you've had beautiful country all around you. you've just had to life up your eyes!
next we got a siberian redneck, viktor. into snowmobiles and snowboarding. so naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
where are the kids?
make a right.  you can't miss it.
henry!
weak sister.  i still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. y'know?
well it's more than loneliness. hate. people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? i'm all screwed up.
leave your tongue off of that!
all right then.
we're vice, i didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. but if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
affirmative, admiral.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
where was this?
five years.
nevermind, what'd you two find?
he's coming over here!
i hope i'm back in a couple of hours. don't drink all the coke. 
yeah! i got two of them fuckers...
did you find something?
yes.  to be honest i never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- i think it's really going to mean something.
your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
plissken...?
cobb's right. i mustn't talk to anybody.
doesn't cbs have confidentiality agreements, mr. bergman?
oh, yeah, really, oh!
if the mayor wants me, he knows where i am.
tell me.
you should have taken their offer. especially if you were unprepared.
our child's safety is at stake.
they look like plain old rocks.
did you see the way those girls drove off?  i did you a favor.
they're excited!  they're happy about destroying a whole city. would they do that to a white man's city?  never!
i think you must have had a love affair with her...
wha'...what are you doing here?
i still got one ace to play.  tran's got what i want... and i've got what he wants...
omgs, mongols, nazi low-riders, prison gangs?
pike, please --
well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, dude.
...to fall back on.  you know, a fail-safe.  insurance.
how can you still believe she's innocent?
colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
it won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
you've been hurt.
i'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
hey, bob.
kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
you know it is!
let me up! let me up!
agent lowry.
i'm seeing something that was always hidden. i'm involved in a mystery. i'm learning. and it's all secret.
i hope so.  but that's up to the guy upstairs.  upstairs...  ...hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
i didn't expect to see you.
paul, this scotch is exceptional.
oh yeah, real funny.  yuk-yuk. let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
look, i'm sorry.  you were gone.  i just assumed you were off having fun.
no. that is what you get for distracting me.
i had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  anne and i have been married what? -- thirty-six years... everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, i was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. so yesterday i looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
you're cute, max.
jade, i don't want you coming in here no mo'.
soon as we leave here.  stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
-- what? --
what's wrong with it?
do you know where you are?
is this a may day pageant?  are you all off on a lark...?  the raven passed this way hours ago!
for being one helluva guy.
we're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
why not?
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
if he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
i'm sorry.
we'll all get out of here together.
what kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
dwayne...  it is imperative that we keep this confidential.	now we know someone's out there.  very close. it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
i don't know, i've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
mother?
so what's the story on this thing?  this cancer stuff?
high time you got back.
nobody escapes us.
let's go back, barry...
comrade buljanoff...
i know.
they're all your enemies?
uh-huh.
how are you?
there you go. i love bill cosby pictures.
yes.  and that one, too.
what are you looking at?
you and me, tom.
i thought you said you never knew your father.
two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
this is my room.
to love you until death.  to subscribe to all your commands.
i think it's worth a look. don't worry, number one, we'll get you to betazed with time to spare.
have you ever done anything like this before?
my crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
but what about this?
i'm a police officer. i'm going to have to talk to the boy. what's his name?
dad?
yeah.
there's something in there.
it's a rip and a hit.
what happened?
describe mallory? okay. she's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, sir launcelot, from the court of camelot.  i have come to take you ...  away ... i'm terribly sorry ...
we had a bargain.  you promised.
that remains to be seen.
oh, sh-
why can't i let go of this woman?
kill me?  christ we're partners in this!
i reckon if you want me to.  i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
yes -- it would be nice.
are you all right?
yes, major.
you're the one who's nuts! there's no one left to touch us, booth.  we're home free!  we just plant a little of the money on dwayne, and it's all ours.
where is he?
i don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so i won't try.  claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
i'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
mr. oh.
i can't drive, dude, it's erev shabbas.
all i'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
sit. can you...  [the chair. have the chair.]
no, c'mon --
yes?
what's cookin', bert?
harvey says he's amazing.
yeah, that's right.
oh, they'll publish it all right. but that's not going to stop me -
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
who said anything about the catholic church...
it's a good day.  i feel good.
that you feel that way about me.
louis, you tellin' me the truth?
tapestries?
who?
no more... please...
too hot, huh? well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
what's he talking about?
no, i don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  lee, she's wired...
this place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
well...  what do you think about then? i mean...  well what do you think about?
where’s m?
what?...
- and you felt just like that talking to addison.
you think it's funny, huh?
one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! she- never-spoke-another-word.
that was a joke? you don't tell jokes.
at this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
they know you are tutsi!
but we fought.
so--have you thought anymore about dartmouth?
at least you were outside.
why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  what do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? it pisses me off!
there's other things to be learned.
who is that young man?
oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
you know the ancient tongues?
oh yeah?  i guess we still need to see that price tag.  like art, right?  you hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. that's not how it ended. i was five when my dad got shot.
i was supposed to take the children to new england next week.
this time...
equipment?
i can't think.
no money in his room there?
into stargher.  inside...
they have stolen state property.
i have just had the most vivid... dream... about josephine.
it's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  one really can't be too careful about home invasion.
i don't know.  could be.  we're runnin' that down now.
tell me.  i won't think you're insane.
could be.
pops put big daddy's farm in rhonda's and sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
i'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
he had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
that silberman just crack me up.  he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire. screwed it first, then set it on--
people seem to like my cat.
and what's with this new title?!  my poster says "i changed my sex"!
they didn't. the guys felt it was the only way i'd get a date. anyway, you're pretty good. you're elite.
that was cool.
collect?
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury, dad?
most of the time i slap it.
twenty thousand.
i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all.
look, i care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
did he shut you down?
my lateness may have well been absence. a course has already been taken.
no, i mean --
no? funny that. neither did i.
god ... this can't be true.
rose, what are you doing up?
listen to me, bain.  two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell. you don't know how they got the information.  it bothered you, but you didn't care.  how do i know this?  because ten years ago, i was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
you met people.
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted.
that thing you said before.  pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. because of what you gave up for motherhood...
it's better to be free, right?
oh, al ... this is just...
i'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
what are they peeking at? captain waldowski in the shower?
okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
miss me, baby?
been busy, have you.
cheerful news to greet the morn.
good morning, rose. and how do you feel today?
everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.
-- now, just a minute. who told you to ask me that?
it's so pitch-black tonight.  i feel lost.
tell me, knox. if you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
ha ha.  no, really.
sir, i understand what you're doin', but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
this is richard low. stay on the phone. do not disconnect. i'm watching you. i will instruct you where to drive.
i know.
i don't know.
"soon". or at least sooner than never.
we'll meet new people. you might have friends out there you never met.
...i been talking about two nurses leo and me picked up in a bar on seventy-first street.
so far only their scouts. but we have had reports of a small impi farther north, over there. 
so this is it, right?
they're gone.
do me a favor -- his lungs, punch 'em out.
eight to five little boy blue is plastered.
doctor. ear, nose and throat man,.
ah, get with it, will ya, charlie?
you need to leave.
you do that?
that line was tampered with...
you see someone?
do you renounce satan.
oh, bu...uh...i can't say that.
you're late.
come on paulie, share the wealth. you copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
you like my play.
that's good: he earned it.
okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.
i didn't mean just the theater.
no, sir!
really?  was the third act too intense?
buy and - sell? no, no, pardon me, exchange .
he's arrogant and threatening. voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
we can try again.
just an observation.
and then you'll leave her out of it?
how long?
the veronal -- you. i'm going to stay here with you.
i don't understand sam.  he's just not like this.
so what's up with you?
what?
well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  she has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
maybe.  or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  somebody with a grudge.  thought you might want to spread the word.
what's wrong?
this is your standard dart gun.
i'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it.  what do you want me to do?
where did you hit her?
huh?
let's admit we struck out this month. the gulf stream's standing by. the basic lab stuff is on it.  you, zeller, jimmie price, a photographer. anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. we get the call, we roll. the scene'll be very fresh...
yeah.
philip swann?
i... if you don’t mind, i do not think he matters now. it... things turned out to be as we thought; leon was weak. there’s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
is she?
jimmy bones?
now? okay. wait a minute. talent --  the only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
sorry.
i haven't been too punctual with the rent.
made by you, loki!
out of the mouths of babes.
chick-en.
and these?
he met a girl.
listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  i have no complaints with that, in fact, i was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. it says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
sergeant major!
the space shuttle has landed!
not without my effects.
fag.
kate?
of what??
i don't know. something to do with the four-packs...  ...they're not bad.
this is my partner. we keep records of hospital visits. nothing personal.
she's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
new york, frances! broadway! this is your chance! you belong on the stage!
mr. concannon...?
i'm gonna get this developed and send it to the warren commission.
no i won't. i swear.
that's your expert opinion?
they probably stopped off somewhere. have her call me when she gets back. i've got lyndsey here and i want to know what time to put her to bed.
talia, don't go!
nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
well then... only one way to go.
the lady knows this is a dandelion.
 a slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, i need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
look here, sir -- i'm completely at your mercy -- i'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- i had to get some money -- tonight.
no...no.
stay. i will come to you.
good day, doctor.
you referring to your intellect, goodspeed?  or another portion of your= anatomy ....
how're ya fixed for ammunition?
i'm gonna propose.
dead cat!
what's wrong?
i'm joe galvin, i'm representing deborah ann kaye, case against st. catherine laboure.
i am answering...
who gave it to you?
he wants to see you. lex luthor.
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon. i thought they was a-doin' wrong. i was about your boy's age. they say i'm well now from it.
are you okay?
mookie, what took you so long?  i got a business to run.
maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
your wheel, dude!  i'm rolling out!
yah, well, they exist all right.
where'd he say he was going to do this?
what'sa matter...forget your registration?
merritt, forensics.
frank. come in.
here's something you might find interesting.  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. however, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
so it's off to london for a week?  new york for a month? l.a forever?
well...
yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
yes, great movie...
hail the all-knowing bruce wayne. here's what i know, she loves me, not you and it's driving you crazy. it's why you stopped us from kissing. because if you can't have her, nobody can.
good. i'm glad to hear that.  ... how did you like meeting the president?
i've got to write some of this down.
darling, you can't go through any more of this.  now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
okay -- likes:  thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
of course, sir.
just getting acquainted. trying to make one friend in this barracks.
yes, sir.
you better have a pretty good explanation for this, selena.
right in line with that burning tree.
i have an idea for that.
you're sure?
i'm starving.
there are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. this is not a toy. i've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. worshipping, schwartz, worshipping properly.
couldn't get the words out before.
not that i would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
and what did you do?
actually, we just wanna watch tv...
track their weapons fire.
where did you get it?
nothing....i mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash i have....
no.
she's around. always is.
good night, eve.
what is bruce doing ?
oh, you two idiots! george, sit down and have dinner.
what the hell did you expect me to do? just forget about you?
who was the other man?
you know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
i'm not.
and scary.
meet col --
you're leaving?
are you and hannah seeing each other, james?
pause play.
just a little joke. see you later, old friend.
i knew your father.  he was quite...
we closed.
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
...this, uh, this commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the rothstein application.
hell-
and? 
this is supposed to be salvation?  what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
i've done nothing wrong.  i'm the victim here.
there's an infinitely greater danger. if--  listen.  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  to do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, sl 270.
then what do they have?
who was your teacher?
where?
a king must marry, after all.
everything does. one of the laws of nature. people are always so afraid of change. but if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. not many things you can count on for sure.
that isn't it. it's ... the loneliness, mr. scratch ... the loneliness!
you can trust me, judy.
maybe i'll see you later, when i pick up my car?
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, i'm coming to you out of loss. i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
what is it?
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! look at me, you filth! what did you think you were doing?!
give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
did jenny know?
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
why can't i drive home?  i will. you.  look at you.  <u>you</u> need a ride home.  and you don't even know it.
chart break-out on this one here...uh whitewood-young industries...low p.e. explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. great cash flow. coupla 5% holders. strong management.
i believe you, and i see i must hasten to leave, for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men.
i... i don't know what you mean, sir.
i can see the hatch.
she'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound christmas fruitcake. she's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
okay, we'll order out.
we saw the broads.
so this is your mother's apartment?
is this blackmail?
finish it up without the lip.
thank you, alma.
you got your f-14, you got top gun, you got your migs....you're our new top gun instructor...now what?
-- i've been here before! -- on my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
yes, there are, aren't there.
for starters i'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
can i... um... have some water?  please?
the extras are in their places. now we need the star.  wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
i've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  i know you're mixed up in all this, dude, and i don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  that's your business.  all i'm saying is, i want mine.
whoever hired us.
yeah. drexl had an association with a fella named blue lou boyle. name mean anything to you?
i hope this place is cool. we could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
i think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
impressive. this is bigger than our whole house.
you come here often?
never?
not now he doesn't.  this is my place.
whatever.
to...you know.
good. now you can go for a reason.
partly.  but there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  that's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
when?
according to your mother. when the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
come on, jerky, you can tell me.  got a white wife, huh?  blonde bombshell type. remember what happen to o.j... what team do you play for?  you're not related to the jacksons, are you?
gotta get that chain off her, laz. somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
i used to pitch.
jesus, i don't know...
is he going to be alright?
the guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but i don't think that's what they were there for.  i think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, george...
there is no other way.
in that little thing?
ok. say what it is.
in cluett's office?
joe, could i ask you to take a walk? buy a tie or something.  i know i'll be seeing you.
i wouldn't worry about schulz. i'd worry about sefton. remember me? i'm the stoolie.
don't look good for "trial of the heart."
you sound...ground up...?
you fuck me, then snub me.  you love me, you hate me.  you show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, tyler?
he was fully sedated!
hello. hello.
rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. if you're going to talk nonsense, i don't want to talk to you at all. rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
hey, me. over here.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
come on, you! before we slap you down.
maybe you're right.  twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
upstairs.
and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
hey, auggie, i've just been thinking. you wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? some summer help while vinnie's gone?
nice.
benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. now if you won't do me a simple favor i don't know what.
what do you think i am -- a crook?
did mommy ever see this?
yeah!  welcome to beautiful iraq.  land of enchantment and riches.
) but thea -- she stands in your way. i know you. i know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
no kidding.
i know it -- i know it -- the moment i was rid of him --
yes.  dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  two-three-kick-turn!  turn- turn-kick-turn!  it's enough to make you throw up!  at last a chance to do straight drama!  to deal with conflict, with inner truth.  roger de bris presents history.  of course, i think we should add a little music.  that whole third act has got to go. they're losing the war.  it's too depressing.  we'll have to put something in there.  aaahghhh!  i see it!  a line of beautiful girls, dressed as storm troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... two-three-kick-turn!  turn-turn- kick-turn!
well, please excuse us!  we...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
give a girl a chance, captain.
well, i just talked with ben tramer and he got real excited when i told him how attracted you were to him.
was anyone hurt?
he said i couldn't win.  that no one wins at this game.
be good to your mother, darlin'. she needs you.
mister president, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  thirty acknowledged the recall.  that makes four shot down.
you must be a londrigan.
there are six hundred people down there. we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
why are you asking me all this?
that depends on who "they" were.
that from the lock?
oh, laugh if you will, but i happen to be familiar with your record. let me point out just two items. in 1935 you ran guns to ethiopia. in 1936, you fought in spain on the loyalist side.
chickenshits? what you bring your buddies with you?
talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
that's right.
blaine, if i knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
tight fit.
hello.
because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
i never saw him before.
what the hell was that, another statement?
what about air strikes?
that yours, mrs. mckenna?
i can feel it from them! they want to know who made us, what became of him. they have their rules, their idiotic rules!
shut up.
no, i didn't.  i said, "will it change my life," alvy.
oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
she did not.  the mouse ran down the drain.
what's the matter with you? you want to be killed?
they're supposed to be evidence.    that's why bastaldi set this up.
but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  hey, king....you're not thinking of --- you don't mean you'd --- ???
we'll find the evidence.
you do not disturb me.  please stay. having trouble sleeping?
you're late.
i got to get going.  an agent is showing me a house up on broad beach in ten minutes.
what do you mean?
she just died, your mother just died?
i want to help you.
the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. don't ask me to explain it. i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. after it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
i do, too!
oh, no, really - i'll be all right.
take your time... one day at a time, kid...
right.  oh, and here.
i like you.
hi. where's cato?
oh well, then i'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
quiet!  callate!  where's diego?
nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  you can do what you want, greer. but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
what about us?
no.
you talk them into it?
thanks for the walk. maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
don't say that, we can do it somehow. it might not be perfect, but --
i can't imagine spending money on towels.
no, thank you, doctor.
no. he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. to cleveland, actually.
what, lewis?
a bit of one.
i think think a lie stinks.
electra.
it still doesn't mean...
my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
yeah, thanks for everything.
aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
mitchell was dead enough.
now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
again.
and then one day, he didn't come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo containers don't just fall on people. he was murdered... after that i fell apart. i dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. when my mother died i hit bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and i knew what i had to do.
i feel right now like there's one burning in me.
there's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
here you are, senator. not a bad desk, either. daniel webster used to use it.
so where's the harm?
y'mean frame him?
reverend mother, i just wanted to congratulate you.
terry, slow down.
the nightmare juice! it's gone! somebody switched it for a beaker of grape kool-aid!!
you are really going to force this, aren't you?
yep.  so how's annie?
say hi to rob and carrie. have some fun!
yes.
yo --
not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
you didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
as much as ever.  nothing.
a cold drink? okay?
appreciation for what?
listen to what i'm saying. the militia's arriving to quarantine the city. most of us are getting out while we still can.
one half bar of chocolate. one bunch of keys on white metal ring. one packet of cigarettes. two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. one pocket comb - black plastic. one address book - imitation red leather. one ten penny piece. one white metal wristlet watch, "timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. anything else in your pockets?
"iunno." i'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. i'm sorry for sounding hostile, but i'm not sorry for...
i'll bring back a doctor.
but of course yours worked.
uh - - mr. hammond - -
yeah... do you mind if i sit?
missed you, cousin.
the same. same as what?
o.k., kid--  i'm only sorry for one thing.
last month, the duke of suffolk spent no more.
on the house. you did me a favor. check the corridor.
no.
i guess we'll call you two-ply.
"there's more light here," he says--
what class did you say that was?
he knows who you are!  he's afraid!  i can tell!
it's not that, it's just that...  it i get caught, i'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
she is.
i'm in your applied theories class. we're all down at the math and science building.
then <u>where's the body</u>? .. where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
jus' from around the way.
gus -- go over to berkeley. harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. carbon beth on everything.  i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go; nick is left there with gus.
don't worry about what we used to be.
oh, vada...
it didn't.
doesn't it have a name?
thurman munson.  he was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  and he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  so i stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
go on, tell the truth; i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion.
all of this so you could capture me?
o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you. she is the fairies' midwife, and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman, drawn with a team of little atomies over men's noses as they lie asleep; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; o'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again. this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage: this is she--this is she!
my father's sword means more to me than any other possession i have.
you're a l-lawyer?  i... i haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. i...
they never find that girl.
you're learning the hebrew really fast.
jeff! you're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
no.
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
please! just one moment.
martin...i want you to know some- thin'...
i think i know how to restore your reputation.
erin.  you don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
are you nervous?
look.
i'm sorry about --
it bit you.
ryan's really angry with me.
yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
yes, i, yes, i signed it, yes. but i, i didn't write that figure.
guys. we're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? nobody does that in michigan. nobody.
why the smirk?
shall i alert dr. mccoy?
hey, man, you know that in switzerland--and this country's the size of east l.a., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? fifty-four!
sleep all right?
why sixpack?
i just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. we don't have much time until eighth period.  i have other things going on, too, you know.
i wasn't watching television.
this kid's special, sean. i've never seen anything like him.
who used to say that?
indiscretions, abbe? please. i've read his case history. at sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. after six months in the dungeon at vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
excuse me, but how old are you?
you wanted a story.  you got it.  turn on the tv now.  and then get your ass down here ...  ...
but we can, we can do it together. spirit and guts, remember?
i happened to be passing, and i thought you might like some corfee.
boy, do i know how you feel.  first time i heard that number, i said you got to be kidding me.  forty god damn percent?
ugnh.
can't lock up...
whose blood you got all over you?
...and you're even lovelier than i pictured. i brought a birthday present for mr. gekko.
you wanna call it a night after here?
hey, man, good to see you.
sorry.
oh that's just nothing. that's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
this is sam wilder, marshal in devil's cauldron.  had some killings here.  i got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. cyberspace, mr. case... a realm i believe you're familiar with.
i had you pegged, didn't i?
you live in...alaska.  the only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
where's fezzik?
what else did he tell you?
and maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, i...
something wrong, jesse?
has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
what about an untrained pup, white...
michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  will you stay home with sam tonight?  i'm meeting max for dinner after work.
what's the matter?
we'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  school and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. this has to be handled delicately. dan kelly, in the district attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  christ, this could be embarrassing.
sir, that is true.
you don't understand, master. the big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
say, david...
hi...
just passing through santa carla?
hiroshima.
that's lord frederick tessier. owns most of freeside. wintermute's mainframe is centred in the royal family's villa.
nothin'.  i was just foolin' around.
increases?
maybe i ain't.
i'm looking for him.
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --
seven...
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  that's her place.
well, i for one, am glad of a little diversion and i'm glad they're here...
so it's you he was after!
are you okay? you looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
they'll have units blocking us up ahead.
do it.
it's a lotta dough. if i was to run across that dame, you know what i'd do?
- you who don't have a conscience.
has not, doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
i know i left them there.
no sir. i was just getting , well you know. water. we weren't talking about sex or anything else except star wars. just saying hello. i think i'm gonna go now.
well... that's true.  i have a child by a man who won't marry me!  who's always leaving...
that's two words. and i'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? i need to graduate. besides, merk's a boy scout.
i know something no one knows.  he has had his finger removed.  on his left hand.  it left a scar. 
no.  why don't you cover it up walter...
still no word of your courier? we'll find him.  but at least this will satisfy our friends here. you've been invited to the new year reception at the presidential home. i understand your brother is here as well; i hope he'll come.
- right..
that's right. and guess who's the new king of the unemployment line.
remember the first time we made love - and then ---
no trouble.
response?
should i?
-- 73
so what's the problem?
they hate each other --
you're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
mr. joshua.  well, i've enjoyed talking with you.
tower, air force one has been boarded.
sweetie, we called the company.
i dunno...
you better get going, hon.
central park.
oh.  why is it that you want to get into film financing?
i'm not sure i know it.
alex, i think you're freaking out. greg's gone, i'll give you that.  and maybe he's in trouble.  but it's not arcade that's doing it...
ah, yes -- proceed.
that won't help you! you can't intimidate us!
fire, or clear out, ice.
and you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
well, he doesn't need to worry.
what do you want. amy?
well, everyone's desperate for a new falkland's angle.  purdy's come up with a real dog.  worker's rights in argentina.  so i've been running round getting people to do things.  but no one's keen.  workers rights.  when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  i said to purdy, "look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
what's going on, kay?
hey... dewey. can we go now?
because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
you were going to say something.
is that what you came here to say?
it works.
hello?
we're going to be moving, son.
the only time people like dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. that guy, doug snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
watch it, brody.  you're ruining the shot.
down- i'm-i'm goin' uptown.
i'm sorry, mrs. rieper. i'm feeling quite fatigued.
oh!!
okay.
what's going on, logan?!
i hope she's a good sailor....
i thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
ma... you know, if connie was here i wouldn't min' any a this.
a $500 tip! for the housekeeper!
nothing.  there's no safe under here.
i've been helping for the last few days. weeks.  sam's working.  i told you sam was working.  i mean, he really is.
what do you mean, sire?
i'm glad of it you was borned.  i reckon i ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
yes?
well, george, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
then what are you scared of, honey?
and spock with it. they are joined together.
i'm...at a loss. he was part of that whole...yale thing, you know.
that's great coming from you.
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
am i?
no, sir.
naturally.
you wrote this?
richard ... come with me, would you ...
because of the nature of murder.  "there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
maybe...
ah, yes.  well, charmed, i'm sure.  so, princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
don't do this.  i am literally begging you not to do this.  chris.
dinner in ten minutes.
when are you coming home?
what're you, crazy??
how do you know i made it up?
you're saying the thief wants us to think it's mac but it's really not.
back to the city. i may take off to europe for the rest of the summer. i just can't handle it around here.
now, you make a toast.
...all right now, when i say "ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and i try and pin you. that's the whole game. got it?
yes, i need them very much. and if you ever say them i'll never let you take them back.
all the companies know. the faculties tell 'em. at the target schools.
you think i'm dumb, don't you?
do you think i care
why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin?
you know, you're pushy, fella...
you're a beautiful girl. you don't want to ruin your looks. i've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
-- knock it off!
i'm going... i am... i'm going to be sick.
animal, vegetable, or mineral.
it isn't? what is it conducted for?
john: you go fetch ruby.  big ruby's my problem girl. she can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
hi!
find a chaplain.
she's in the bathroom.
what's the hurry ?
he's alive!
don't i know you...
yes, reverend?
when'd you get in?
what is it with crack and transsexuals?
you get rid of her.
want a blow job?
i must be in the wrong business.
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing?
i'll be done in a minute.  you misspoke before.  you're not "stepping down."  i'm taking you out at the knees.  the whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  i'm firing you. action's taken.  confidence restored. stock goes up.  i sell my shares.
well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
i want to watch t.v.
yeah, well my stereo player is broke. but i'm sure the record is ok.
but if you could, you would?
yeah.
here's the list of all sheldon's credit charges. nothing after the silver creek.  any calls?
excuse me, mr. treves, sir.
what goes down there? i mean who's the priest i keep seeing, he's there all the time. he has black hair and he's very intense looking?
her credit cards. how far am i gonna get with that?
i can just barely see him.  i think he's leaving.
i have a better idea. i'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
you are a beautiful woman.  too bad things had to work out like this.
whose place is this again?
how is it a farce?
no, it's pronounced aye gor.
i'm minister malcolm x. two witnesses saw him brought in. he was not brought out.
only you can help me. i'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.
[the money, 10 million u.s. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the k&r agent. then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
with who?
well, you said anybody can waltz... how'm *i* doin'?
your son marty?
it takes hours to get a drink around here.  there's only one waitress.
well... how have you been?
beg pardon, ma'am?
yes.
what night?
i see.
so... smell... is... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  and a memory can trigger a smell.
why?  why me?
i never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..you're so different from what i..and so the same.
has she called?
no.
what if every country legalized at the same time?
don't step in the horse manure.
well, i need grass and so do you.
let's try to be practical about this. the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. i'll remain here... because... well, i don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. anyway, i just don't feel like leaving.
ok!
you stay out of this!  why, spock? why? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger.
--no, no you hear me out, sean. this young man is a true prodigy--
i'm just leaving.
well, maybe we should talk ab...
you know, that's interesting. i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak. i couldn't taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender. i didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  i've never been on a cow farm before. i must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior.
you scare me.
stop brushin' me back!
learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  central school of speech and drama. it's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. at seventeen.  they offered her a place at rada n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was jenny.  she could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  show up the old man, you know.
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue.
jill, say hello to felicia.
in ya go...
thank you, mom! thanks, dad!
silly?   silly am i?
how come i can't remember?
will that work for me?
we get out of this alive, maybe i'll take that miracle cure of yours.
flash, drop it--
why the hell we drivin' here?
no.
hello george.
peter webber!  right.  quite the spotlight on that guy.
yeah.  great.
how was...  ...the ballet?
yes, cats, of course. what else could they be? cats. of course each one has his own name too.
who are you ?
you can't sell this to your friends.
and for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
you don't fear death?
you mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
we just smeared a skunk.
ready, frankie.
see what i mean? it's a funny business, isn't it?
we leave in the morning?!
jack ...
sir, i'm a british officer.
of course, harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear he's arrested for floating nude down the seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, i can tell you. harold, dear, stop playing with your food. don't you feel well?
no more water, you said.
how you doing? we're looking for slim.
don't give me that!  i was on the bridge.
yeah?
gerry says the meeting went well.
okay.
hello, colonel! want a lift?
you're a good mama to that boy. you care for him. you work hard fer him to take care of him. you light him up in his eyes, i've seen it. he wouldn't know what to do without ye.
you let me go four years ago, jeff. only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
no, i don't.
we're damaged goods.
how old are you?
no, you would not, louis. danger hold you to me.
if you must know, yes. i don't know what to do. i can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, i'm completely infatuated with her.  she made me laugh.
oh --
answer and i'll shoot!
i don't know it!  get on a goddamn jet to tokyo and ask the chairman! i'm telling you!  you're just going to have to kill me --
and you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
i don't.
advanced botany.  dna splicing. recombinant animal plant patterns. pheromone extractions.
you paid two hundred pounds for this?
come on.
yes ma'am, i am.
sir.  if tomorrow... i was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
that's incredible! nobody told me! i swear! it's kismet. maxine! it's a beautiful name. there's a psychic connection. don't you see? it was meant to be! maxine! maxine! maxine! i will shout it from the rooftops!
cassie, thank christ!  we're under attack.
why special?
what did she tell you?
let's just say i...eh...i'm involved.
naomi, i really value our relationship. i hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
really?
you can have half.
and?...
you're so scared.
who is this?
--which young?
i've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  about us, actually.
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
i don't know -- i'd like to do anything --
wow! it's a half-boy, half-horse. the boys walk up to him, impressed.
spice!... pure un-refined spice!
wow!
do you want to?
it just occurred to me that i've never snuck through your bedroom window.
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
you put me in an awkward position, mr. kessler.
what's she done?  i'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
just fine.
no pain, mr. kringelein?
yes...
i've been thinking.
maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
in return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  do we have a deal?
how long were you married?
you know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow coca cola and eat kentucky fried chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  i can't lie to me, liza.  and the more i strip through the sham, the crazier i look to people like you. can't you see that's what they're counting on?  you want to go out sometime?
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. but you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
oh. what about?
sister paul?
... everything.
the loser is nothing. -- only the princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder. we must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
that's a very stupid question, ross.
we're over our heads. mr. sulu, get us out of here.
do you want me to stick around?
yeah.
so what are you going to do?
talked to her this afternoon... while you was out.
yeah, i've seen him.
i'm looking for frank mackey.
i need her exact name, you see.
stop that.
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
he's been repeating that since birdson's exorcism.  i looked in every passage in the bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
peter, you have to admit--
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>what</u> <u>is going on</u>?
how can i help?
who’s the money man?
i know it has been terrible.  but it wasn't your fault. and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. you understand?
where's dad?
voss -- charles voss. all right, mrs. voss --  -- i'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  scott, cathy, and ham, jr.
aren't  you forgetting something?  your coupon.  we gotta have it.
i'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag...
we can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
sure.  you didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell.  if i believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
i'm just explaining to you what i'm doing here. case you think i come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
okay. should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for --
'the last of the mohicans.' only book my father ever read.
okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... i mean i am not gonna let some podiatrist with a jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
no, louis!  no!
sure.
i don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. private school, harvard, and now med. school.  i actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. i shouldn't have told you that...
you new, kid?
then what are you going to do?
personal effects...
then, what do you suggest, don sanchez?
i'm hungry.
push it.
i'm sorry... oh my gosh, are you george mccord?!
that was war.
you monsters!
what?
no, i need my car --
it's a very nice letter. but i have to go with what's best for the students.
i've lived in africa a year and i don't know what you know. how long have you been here?
eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
to experience beyond anything ever known. at least that's what i was promised when i bought it. pleasure from heaven or hell. i didn't much care which.
yes -- very, very big!
yes.
oh, no. he told you.
yeah.
i used to think about it.  i had margaret.  she wanted kids.  i thought about moving somewhere far away like, europe.  i could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but i couldn't see that next part.  'then what?' so i'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  you understand?
it's not your fault. mrs. kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny.
where did he go?
hannah, i never would have bothered you but i'm off to miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast.
so these two girls come over to the bar...
mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
i'm not going to report it.
i'm serious.  that's why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  why, man, i have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  who knows how long i may keep you waiting.
i've never seen him.  i don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
tv repair?
la hire, i'm warning you -- don't swear!
yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
you're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
ah, c'mon...
didn't you see <i>raiders of the lost ark</i>?
adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
afraid ... of what?
better than being caught with your pants down, right?  john mcclane.
i think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
i had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. in fact...you might say that mr. tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
i'll take him anyway.
are you ready to put him in?
it's her -- from the institute. if we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
does it hurt?
they need the money for my band uniform at school.
and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i don't say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?'  so i says, 'well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
i don't wanna go, i can't do it this time.
and all this will be for real?
you know our two most senior senators:  gaius cantus and falco verus?
three weeks, ev.  i didn't tell him i killed anybody...
i've never been in an apartment above a store.  you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
pari persu; what the fuck is pari persu...?
of course.
oh, yeah, yeah.
guys, what's the sitch?  i'm bored.
go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. it'll have to do for now.  what's your number? the number of your apartment?
a real criminal.... i still think that's our in... what about her ?
heroes ain't supposed to shake. i'm shakin', man, look at me.
here you are.
i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
i... in that small context i would have... i would have to say 'no.'
what!
you look good.
what's the meaning of this?
where's my brother?
it's bad.
sometimes.  and sometimes i don't--  shut the fuck up!
no.  i mean yes, i'm not.  i decided to call it off.  well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
who's joey venza?
nope.
what did you tell that girl?
excuse me sir. are you a guest of the club?
well, yes, i would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  i don't know why it would.
i went through all that with your husband. it's no deal.
maybe he just went to the store.
rebecca -- take these off.
i'm rachel. thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
may i help you?
it's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  it's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
oh, harold, don't upset yourself so.
so?
here i am bragging my mom is the tooth fairy, and i'm talking to santa's kid!
you use "richard" again? we're back in paris.
they can use their imaginations.
nah.
no! all you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! but i'm not you, mother, and i never will be, and thank god for it!  that goes for you too! and frankly, i don't know how, with the two of you, i turned out as sane as i am --  wait right there, gentlemen, i'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, i don't want to stay here one second longer than i have to!  but i've got to tell you, lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. in shame!
i thought we were talking about sidney?
what's that?
you look beautiful.
thanks, talia...why are you so nice to me?
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
so, mccall, how come you ended up in san francisco?
not me.
no -- i'm afraid not.
now i'm nice? don't you know any other adjectives? there's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
we gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. why'nt you an' ray come on over.
yeah.  if.  whatever.  what kind you figure it is?
how do you know i took it?  how do you know they didn't just give it to me?
just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. and remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
you think you're gonna last all summer?
dr. thompson...?
what?
your majesty!
because i know you're full of shit.
what lousy luck--i mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
what are you doing?
uh-huh. he's the, uh...
hello, rick.
what's that?
that's what we're here to find out.
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  but then you make friends so easily.  don't you, grace?
why not?  he eats everything else.
lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
who am i?  well, let's see.  charles foster kane was born in new salem, colorado in eighteen six -  i run a couple of newspapers.  how about you?
mother o'god...
and what do you do -- now?
andrew marsh was a very wealthy man. a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spot-light.
yeh, luther said you could teach me something.  i already know how to drink.
what is going on here, satch?  what are those guys doing out there?
you're asking for somebody else?
i'm sure there's a logical explanation.
keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
mmm.
pierce isn't like regular people. i dig him, but he scares me too.
that's stab 3, miss weathers. it looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway.
that's ironic.  because we're here to protect her from you.
who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
someone worthy of respect, lad.  she be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
i can't let you do that.
i was ahead of my time.
i was nervous, that's all! where is the guy?
are we going to skip the country, uncle lex?
he says you are very sad ridiculous man. i don't agree of course. and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. nadia is a prostitute. i'm sorry.
well--for a couple of years now--i-- i've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a national boys' camp out in our state--
no -- i'm afraid not.
report.
get back to the horses. they're straggling.
it's yourself you've got to be proud of, huckleberry, how much ya need?
i hate cheats.
are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? it might help to absorb some of that liquid. you don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling. so what?  you lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
fixing it.
yeah? that's good. sorry is good. you know i finished that model.
you boys'll have to go to work early.
do you know where they live?
i'm lisa. oh, you have a guitar!
so, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
will we be fighting the zulus soo~, quartermaster? .
landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
can you get into the office?
uh, no, uh i'm a little tired. i fell asleep.
he'll do something.
what do you mean "bad news"?
we must wait. one day the curse will pass. one day a dead man will... will...
my mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
no, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt. whitney.
beth, look, can i trust you with a little secret?
why do you bring this up after so many years?
jeremy would have never killed himself.
where you think you're going?
if you want to wrestle, you got lehigh.  if you want to play tennis, you go to vanderbilt.
are you sure?
i like indiana.
do you want me to go on with this?
i don't know...we've gone off course or something...
what's the idea of locking this?
baby, i'm going to spend the morning at the mall. you know, shop for waikiki. honey, what are you looking for?
you've been working in that video shop too long.
so you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
the medics are looking all over for you.
hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? nobody -- i think i'm gonna train myself.
well... sort of...
george, i'm sorry.  we all know the army will acquit arnold...
a mystery.
hi.
boy, he is great! jeez, that old fat man. look at the way he moves. like a dancer.
i want to be a teacher.
... i was wondering what's such dynamite in this bay of pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate.
then whose name is it registered in?
my son was outside playing soccer. i never saw him playing ball. come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... take me out dancing.
frank said ---
and he is still willing to give you a visa?
i've heard of a white that big, in australia...
you're a good liar.
how'd ya do?
i guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
i hope he fell off.
irena.
damn... lost again. sorry.
was she nekkid?
see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- see that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  only the spirit, the illusion remains. besides, what's real anymore? these days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
more bad luck! i don't like his face, loretta. i don't like his lips. when he smiles i can't see his teeth. when will you do it?
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
and remember that trip we took to africa? that safari was so wonderful. me, you... best of friends... forever.
to put us back together again when we fall.
when we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  except, i finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
how is everybody?
think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  if you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, jenny greenteeth has the answers you seek.
i do have a tendency to use that word too much.
must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
shapiro. shapiro.
nice first impression.  a nose bleed in front of your parents.
i hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. i think i'm getting the fear.
by "takes care of," you mean "kills".
see you, miles. you take care.
you were saying?  your daughter....?
you're being really immature.
ms. heller, mind if i tag along on your field trip? i'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
goddamn it!
charlie!
i'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
write me a note and ain't she sweet. i need a hand and where'd she go.
that's right. so how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
um...
no, i'm not thinking clearly - i need a doctor too, to come with me, can i take this vehicle?  i'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  seventy miles - i can be back here by dusk.
you mean this thing?
you said you wanted the biggest thing i could find... well, this is it.
don't crunch the leaves.
he didn't call?
listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know i'm telling you the truth!
congratulations.
that's it folks for the demon boat ride.... everybody off. watch your hands and feet.
well, i hope you enjoyed yourself.
this man gordon liddy--he's going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
mcgregor's syndrome.  that's what freeze's wife had.
thank you for coming.  i'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
we're not called barrytown anymore, by the by.  they got sick of the barry/barrytown thing.  we're called sdm.  sonic death monkey.
this is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, nick leavitt--
yeah.
i went to bed. freddie's a big man, but i'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. i've suffered all day. who found him?
so what?
why jeopardize what we've already done? we caught the sonofabitch.  carl stargher.  that's going to be like bundy, gacy, dahmer.  a case that makes careers.  but if we push our luck.  if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
oh, my god!
this is good. uhh...
didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
is he for real?
i doubt that. listen, my mother is letting me use her car. i'll pick you up. 6:30.
didn't you say you told her not to come?
look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little od won't surprise anybody. it's the only way we can be together.  you know it's true.
have you?
unless you'd like to stay.
absolutely!
i was just talking a walk.  i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i couldn't find them.  i hate my life.  i just hate it.
congratulations, jim. i think you've saved the earth.
...i don't get it.
uncle terrence?
jesus!  are you serious?
about mr. powell. all of it!
i know.
who cares?
we found a body out by the army base yesterday. been there for a long time.
oh, yes, it's already made up.  our mr. mervin wrote a small review.
are you matthew parker ?
for some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>the</u> sensual experience.
the zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
i don't mean to go on and on like this.
grab the keys, ich, and get inside.
hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
oh, hello.
what do you remember?
bye bye blackbird.
what are you doing in new york...?
what do you want?
real charmer.
you didn't?
mmm.
i can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  and that's the catch. she doesn't want a boyfriend.
mr. clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
that big asshole nailed my windows.
i'll get it.
don't worry about that, that's my department.  now who do we cast? we need a star.  can whoopi sing or dance?
fuck!
..it's really about family and tradition...
you're eighteen.  you don't know what you want.  you won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
you know, they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner.
you didn't answer my question.
marty...
kiss her you fool.
forget it.
why won't you tell me your name?
you didn't know my father --
quit showing off!  we're here on business!
hey, man, why'd you say that?!
it's unbelievable that you can do that.
get some sugar too, for the coffee.
it's fun.
not everything is imputed to memory. the most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. why would the zero file be kept secret?
forging signatures. telling lies. impersonating practically anybody.
i left it in the tent, sir.
want a metrix?
you needn't take it any further, sir. you've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. i've learned my lesson, sir. i see now what i've never seen before i'm cured, praise bog!
just another sleepover at the riley's.
i don't know... he's a little disgusting... although some women go for that.
no... but...
buy a new one! in a new town! where you won't have to hide your mother!
i'm a housewife.
more ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
you're chasing a dream.
shabat shalom mama. i brought some manischewitz. the black label.
ninty-nine percent of acting is commitment. acting.  stella adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught acting...
ohhh.
don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
my back. i can't move. i need my chiropractor.
i think i have no money.
please excuse me a moment, jeffrey, and i'll get to the dishes.
his law firm, same one that hired me. israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
i don't know who you are.
that's great, gerry, that there's interest-- but i'm not sure he's ready for that.
well, i'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  wouldn't want to miss it.
you don't know anything! fact is they haven't bought it! the stock is cheap, archer! what're they waiting for?
and three weeks.
i own a brownstone on this block.
jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?
she's the one to blame. not me.
and now he works for your government, doesn't he, brad?  he's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u.f.o's.  isn't he, brad?
that's right, work it out.
he wasn't drinking. ray fell asleep at the wheel.
she's my girlfriend.
your treat.
listen to me.  you have to consider the possibility that god doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  in all probability, he hates you.  this is not the worst thing that can happen...
yes -- only there's a problem.  the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  it's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  the senator's body is literally burning itself out.  scott -- this machine kills people and i don't think magneto realizes it.
you're great.
you think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? you couldn't even decipher the symbols!
but, here's the thing. he'll only talk to you. he doesn't want you to ask him anything. and you shouldn't stare at him.
but he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
i never asked you to choose.
a donny chiba triple feature. "the streetfighter", "return of the streetfighter", and "sister streetfighter".
oh -- oh, miss flaemmchen. it's you --
i'll cover it. you have any other surprises?
yes, sir.  i'm sorry...  but i don't understand how it was possible.  the only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
norville, there really is something i have to tell you --
nice touch, pritchett: subtle.
he sees me as a threat.
like i said, i...
i love you too honey.
god. isn't this great? working on the job. got a wheel man. got a safecracker. good friends with mr. henry.
sounds familiar.
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
i, uh... i was... attacked. walked in on people robbing me. i was hospitalized. i almost died.
good day, marquis.
so you want me to take her out?  is that an order from the president?
fuck you! you think i want this? that money's a burden to me. every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back. i'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father. but that's life. and i deal with it. so don't put that shit on me. you're the one that's afraid.
he's doing well today.
i can't have them any more.
the museum of natural history doesn't send out investigators to--
bleeker told me katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
oh right. well, i haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  not on "page six" at least.
it's cici! cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
you want to talk about it?
dignan, i can't get my hair cut. that's just not possible, all right?
is it clear?!
i knew we'd pay for it.
self sufficient...
did you love your husband, before you married?
no, we don't have to say it.
the same. he's apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command.
don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
just thought i'd stop by.
what'll we do about it, margo?
no, i promise...  not a chance. i own this guy. there was no one else. i'm on the move too much. trust me.
you didn't have a gun before, did you?
oh shit.  walter.
susie, watch the language, would you please.
trust me, you're the best.
i'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, lloyd.
you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
you want to hit the town tonight?
grace, listen to me.  in the trunk of my car is a rope.  it should reach down here.  got get it, throw it down and i'll climb up.
delivered from swedish furniture.
thanks.
we ain't gonna make it walkin'.
i can't believe this! i feel faint...
that thing.  here it is. right where it's supposed to be.
what's happened?
how many people were in your old school?
your deeds set an example for all other knights. for your gift, ask a gift of me.
he's blunt, but he's got a point.
what?
i don't think it's counterfeit. do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare?
okay, we're in business.
but i'm not. the newspapers're --
let me go.
you've got to get your mind off this.
what?
we had an argument. he's being silly.
i don't think i follow you.
...they kicked out.
does she suffer?  does she know what she is?
it's not a distress call. it's a warning.
does she know about us?
i just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
maybe i should take a few days off. roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
tell me about them, thea. they have great wings end long teeth --
or maybe you called goebbels or goering? you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
this is her family and her fault.
at first i wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  but i found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  it has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
oh god. don!!! why can't i just die.
do i know any gigs?
i know.
you're not finished here?
aren't you glad we waited?
come on in.
no, thanks.  i'll just look around.
oh, god...
which is it? you gotta keep your focus straight.
listen, joanna kramer's got a goddamn good life.  she's got a husband that loves her.  she's got a terrific kid.  she's got a wonderful home--
the greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  now i must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  it began on the night when louis was born.
hobby of mine. got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. free admission.
it's all right, mickey.
he saw her at the northern care...
why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
how long have they been gathering there?
no.
all right. loneliness.  well -- separated. from other people. forgotten.  well, as if i can be here, i can go through the motions, right? but the truth is, i don't belong.
who?
don't you understand?!  that thing didn't want to become a dog...
you swear?
i don't see no wedding ring, banks. conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
where abouts?
why have we stopped?
but i'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
i'm trying to think. when did you start looking so terrible? you look awful.
it's a five-pointed star.
it's a prob'lm i don't think's gonna go away too soon though... peanut, i'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny california.
and his ears.
1944. the next face, please.
i think you're very sweet, corrado.
sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
christ said it in the bible, he said - suffer the little children, i want to suffer like a little child.
what can i do? i am only a boy.
yes...
if looks could kill, i'm dead...
syevodnya?
what does it say?
it saw us!
total manipulation. i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
i don't know who you are buddy, but i swear to god, you got the wrong guy.
look, i appreciate what you did for me. but this is my job. and i'm keeping those pictures.
his newspapers?
i'm sure. but what else do you do with your time? do you go to school?
you look like you've had quite a work-out.
who is it?
he is my brother.
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
i can handle it. he's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
hello.
you want me to go up with you?
enjoy your flight to washington --
the fuck was that?
maybe that is his boat.
a million deaths are not enough for yueh...
78.
even the bedchamber passages!  let none remain!
i think what you fear martin is domesticity. it's the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture. it's centuries old. like king phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the saracens."  so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
um--hello? i've got like a social emergency here.
that's luke. he doesn't like strangers.
i see.
well, let's hope it's all for the best.
you don't trust me.
so josh...
yeah?
thank you, napoleon.
and, we're definitely filling a void in the rural south.
scar! where's he holed in?
we're loose!
i saw it -- !
does that mean...?
so this guy walks into a bar and says...
your feet are cold.
no, for the asylum.
it isn't worth getting a heart attack over, lois.
so, um, pony, where are you staying? are you staying at your mother's house?
why won't you check out lv-426?
thanks for calling.
try the back bedroom.
would you say he was boring, then?
we don't like razinin.
what time?
well, go get 'em, pops.
long live the first amendment.
quod nomen mihi est?
what?
eight thirty.
what do you want?
i've got to get back to the --
so you're testing <u>me</u> now?
i was all noise. played the radio loud. battled constantly with my brother and sister. here i am, world.
what it will be.
no -- not as a rule.
right.
delusions of grandeur.
sure, i'll see what i can do.
i can't do that -- you heard macfarlane.
get a grip on yourself, major!
what?
stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school.
where!
i see.  so this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  you came here with a purpose.
well... the store at saltzburg...  but you won't be going to saltzburg for a while.
heavens no. my work now is... right now i'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
i even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
what guy?
rub your ears.
yes, my dear, he is.
good morning, gentlemen -- i see the conference is already underway.
damn.  just when it was about to get interesting.
comin' in or goin' out?
who?
and mine's conway.
shit. what about tomorrow?
everybody say ho!
all right, daddy. we have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
well, what are we waiting for?
mad, ma?
) oh, maddy, grow up. it says in love without fear that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". page eighty—six.
man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
right now.
he was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again, jesus!
...i was commissioned yesterday in the army reserve. henry morgenthau arranged it. he's a dear friend.
i'm almost ready -
hey, it's legit.  strictly dinner and dance.
such a joker!  like your father.
hah! it's all make-up, chauncey... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up, i didn't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk.
you thought i sent them?
i feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
we're going to have to work on your touch.
look, hannah. when you get him home... make sure he's all right. before you leave. okay?
what if i can't?
why does it all mean so much to you? all the time, 'land, land, land.'
we'll be ready adam.
the...silver...mike...award!
when we start running suck up your breath.  you're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
pretty close.
what's he called?
looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named george bailey.
we ought to kick their asses anyway. even if they do get out of kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
lyndon johnson?
oh, don't they?  i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
oh. well, i did. i was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
i don’t know. how many famous french film directors can there be?
any school you want.
fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.
you sure you wanna meet her? don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. she's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
this is great, puff. you're doing fine.
give 'em a pull.
why not? thai girls best in the world. thai food best in the world. thai dope best in the world.
alright. what did you think?
how 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  please do me that favor.
yes.
i didn't do anything! i'll turn your pathetic ass in!
jonas?
none. he could be hiding, he could be helping sid, or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach.  any idea what sid's going to do next?
perhaps i have a way to bring one here.
-- is what?
that's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  but...  she didn't fool my mother.
yes, that's correct.
what'll it be?
we surprised a band of smugglers.
i know. it's okay.
holy maker, threepio.  i forgot...
mr. barboni is a good customer.  works for jimmy capp.
father... i killed those men...
muggers?!  doug, are you all right? what happened?
they're putting me on film tomorrow.
sure.
come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. project vulcan is about to begin. scott, are you coming?
hello, ford...
it's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
okay, group's in session.  straight talk only in this room.
you are from the hollow?
stop limpin' around like that.
what are you saying?
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
nobody. accounting.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
not impressed, are you?
excellent, senor.  if you could follow me?
what's she doing?
you're sure?  any more nightmares?
you ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
i'm sure he loves you, too. you know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? you're better off not knowing.
well! you don't say!
your use of language has altered since our arrival. it is currently laced with -- shall i say -- more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
edgar, wonderful to see you.  clyde ... hi.
be very, very quiet...
how did it happen?
therapy? hell no, i just don't want to do it alone.
maybe the road's out.
hey, what's the matter... betty, wake up!  why are you staring at me like that?
"thunder road," bruce springsteen, from born to run. "smells like teen spirit," nirvana, nevermind.
how can you just take a life ? i mean it's a life, life is so precious.  how does it feel ?
mine too.
i got a nurse in mind.
i...forgot something.
if you don't mind, mam, i'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
let's have your license, mister.
pretend you're me.  you find this. what would you do?
i mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
[lionheart, what happened?]
well, that was neighborly.
where?
what?
disturbed. and when your friend crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
you can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
if you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
the holy grail?  some billionaire has the holy grail sitting in a commode on madison avenue?
i never went in that sphere.
where's your mama?
carol!
it doesn't usually take that long, but i'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you.
yah, i guess.
should have stayed a girl.
so...does it hurt?
i'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
he flatters me so i'll help him with latin.
no you couldn't.
i want them spitting blood!
understood, sir.
you said:  that you have "decided." that your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  and get on with your job.
yes, sir.  won't find a better cqc on the market.
you didn't tell her!
i don't think so.
you are a fanatic.
a kiss under the misteltoe. mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
sidney winch, meet -
a square?
what happened to you?
not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
are you okay?
if you stay, i think something bad will happen. i think i might hurt you.  you don't want to get hurt, do you?
okay.
mebbe.
work!  don't say that word, man.
these are dilated.  take a look.
they went crazy.
can't we --
i'll go with you.
john --
...don't be crazy. put it to your school loans.
...what do you mean, you decided not to park here?
let's get the fuck outta here. you're not making any sense, man.
-- yes?
sorry to wake you, sir, but starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of enterprise.
no.
like it or not, cyrus, that's my name. cole. just like yours.
the whole core of mars is ice.  the reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
how'd you get here so fast?
ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
that's a lot of people all at once.
i'll manage.
i risk nothing, for i am certain to kill him.
i can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
hey, i know that, hey, i'm <u>kidding</u>...  "it's a pageant"
i've got an even hotter story -- the sap from the city desk.
who else would you be?
never this close.
brad!
nothing, huh?
lemon.
we're not going over there, right?
say, you're an american, aren't you?
at the wedding?  you invite him?  bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
i can take care of myself.  you know that.
no, no, we have to get out of here right now.
count it.
dreams?
how do you say "hospital" in japanese?
no, no, i have to talk to you.
not exactly a lightweight.
well --  - they say he was very wise, so i'm sure he must have.
hey!  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid.  i dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze!' at the bad guy! what'd you dream about?
all i mean is... someone like you...
gentlemen. good evening.
yeah.
i didn't forget.  i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  orange red.  that's your color.  few can carry it off.  now please.  help me find your brother.
i can't swim! i can't swim!
hey, ray, goldmouth don't believe me. ain't it so they got trains up in new york city that run under the streets?
yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  i'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. and you know why?
she didn't want me to be a climber. she wanted me to be a planner like her.
hopefully i can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, dad i'm kidding.
i thought you were going to help carl.
no.  i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
where?
excuse me?
i call it like i see it, and what i see is definitely soft.
which way's out, man -- ?
hard to get up in the morning, huh?
i let him think he was courtin' me, but i reeled him in like a fish on a line. i wanted him. i wanted what he could give me, and i would've done anything to get him. is that love?
whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger.
your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
just make sure you're not caught. if you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. if you find nothing -- he's clear.
i see. i myself cannot. you use evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear l'air du temps, but not today. you brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
their true name is sequoia sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
well i guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard per-gola. you can stand up in it. well, some people could stand up in it. six foot clearance at the ridge. you might just could.
that's ridiculous.
where did you go?
probably. but we can't win alone. we know that. this is the only way.
well, i was hoping to get my balls licked.
nope. we're safe.
i can't... they don't operate that way...
oh sure. a man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
what is it, a sore throat or what?
turtles -- domestic turtles.
find my brother wilfred.  give him this.  i have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  only family can be trusted.
yes, it most certainly is!
you people got a lotta nerve.
what do you mean?
what?
arguing about books.
ethan, you an' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
but we're the focus, right reed? reed...?
it's not here. maybe the police are still holding it. their forensic people...
give me the keys, dignan.
so, how are you?
thank you, norman.
no, not really.
you'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
and just where are you from?
tommy, look!  those lights...
no. the drugs just stopped working. if anything, doing things i love kept me healthy longer.
i'm sorry i went off like that, i get passionate. i--i guess i'm a passionate person. one of those things i had forgotten.  when you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
how did he manage to do that?
mrs. raymond, this is delicious. absolutely delicious.
what do you mean, "possessed?"
what did i say?
thanks.  well...
theodore? where are you? are you alright?
oh.
that's very kind of you.
where are you going?
it's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  it really isn't the usual procedure...
edward, did you hear me?
that's right.  i guess only the killer would know that.
no.
because your writing continues, unchecked.
what'd you say?
39   continued:
you're coming, aren't you...?
captain solo, sir. might i have a word with you?
who are you!  who are you!
no ... there is another.
you must be edward bloom.
it's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
should i just take the documents now?
professor? professor brown?
you watch your tongue.
ml?
whatsa matter with you?
cathy?
well done, miss teschmacher.
then why the rat?
what?! what are you doin'?
i don't think i've done anything to sound off about.
and the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  god! that was so great!
it's the great outdoors.
gettin' a little hot under the collar, i'd say.
you learned her lessons better than i.
we won't. let's go inside.
uh, not today jenkins, i need the fresh air
stop --
wait a minute --
what about them?  they're lunatics.
i redecorated.  what about you?
yes, sir.
good evening.
i hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  mass hysteria is like a story, nell.  a communal story.  someone starts it.  then we all add a little more to it. and then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  this story shapes what we see and hear.  we interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house. you've added to it.  that's what this experiment has all been about.  that's what it was about, the experiment's over.  i'm pulling the plug.  this is my fault.
edward, we've been together ten years.
she's the star reporter on the mail. every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. she's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "cinderella man." you've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
you won't dare to interfere with me here. this is still unoccupied france. any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault.
god may have given it, but claude banks spotted it and nurtured it.
guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
we'll call swat.  we'll get the locals.  throw it!
what's this... have you been smoking... ?
that's what i'm afraid of.  could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
thank you, annette. chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years. does your family do much riding?
uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
i'm so sorry, james. i promise, i'll never leave you again.
it's not like you've given me much choice.
yes, you did. you still do.
well, it shattered your faith in everything.
you people...rich people...
i know.  i know.  but it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  the first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
that's not the point. we're just not in love anymore.
you wanna split?
i'll speak to someone.
must be somebody in there.
i said, 'no.' n-o.
i hope jean-louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
i just came here to talk.
put your gun down!!
i'm sorry.
i'm taking off my mike.
is your room just down the hall? ... in case i get frightened during the night?
tell me.
how come you’re alive? child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  what am i really looking at here, huh?  are you really not just a lousy private eye? am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
get up, damn you.
my mom works over there.  i'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
yeah...beautiful. what would you call that paper there? kind of a...robin egg blue color?
no.
how did you meet him?
for the last time -- surrender!
how could you do this to me?
was she right?
what are you doing?
o, she new well. thy love read by rote and could not spell. come, young waverer, come, go with me, in one respect i'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
you really want to know?
what do you like best about your daddy?
wrong?  look at this!
thank you, vicki.
i want to, bembry, but i can't.
1-800-deepsea delivery.  i hear they're good.
under the table.
can't say that i do.
well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
are you all right with this?  you think this is funny?
that would be jack goodman, the boy who was killed.
what'you want, kid?
then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair.  now are there others?
watch it! compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and boom! careful, huh?
you did that?
you know what?  i think you got schwarzkopf.  you did!  you got the general right in the ass.  now that's good shooting.
hey, buddy. take it easy. you're making me look bad.
damn, dr. weir, don't scare us like that. coffee?
thank you. that'll be fine. don't spend any money on me.
... we shall need some proof of your having resided here, mr. chance.
let me see what you get, but don't jump--the new york times thinks it's crazy cubans.
i got a question, college boy.  what the hell am i supposed to do with these!?  i ask for disaster, pathos, what do i get?  salvador dali!  when i want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, i'll ask for--
she's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, mr. thompson.
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the london times.  what's that about?
my name is parry.
you're not sure?
she wired this system.
take care, wade.
tell me about the letter.
oh, yes.  it just fascinates me how all    these things work.
it was some lady.  she didn't know anything.
so what? the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. hey, how about a date tonight, rita. let's eat pasta and roll around.
camelot ...
good school. what year?
i'm frightened, sir. really! when he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. you know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. and his father's dead.
what happened to his wife?
they forced me to marry!
now what is it?  where's the fire?
tell her what?
here's that certified check, walter.  i drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 i'm a ruined man!
forgive me if i have offended you.
you can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. i'm only killing time.
ya want the truth -- ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
you gotta just look the other way.
that's what he says. i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
...i got a present for you.
the meeting is arranged.  captain best is waiting for you now.
but how...?
not here.  they might see it.
hit by a train! truth means nothin' to woman, delmar. triumph a the subjective!  you ever been with a woman?
what do you mean?
hey, pony, this is my friend bee-bee.
what happened?
some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  maybe we should ask hedda hopper!
hit me in the chest with this...
would you like to see it?
she pepper-sprayed me, man!  she pepper- sprayed me!
dammit!
...but that won't last.
dil!
mr. sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  he wants you to come see him.
smith!  wake up!
i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
i know.
wait a minute....
who wants fruit salad?
carefully, tough guy.  very carefully.
it's a pardon from the governor.
my wife.
there's going to be plenty of time for that.
how... how was miss caswell?
forget about my sister.  if karen sisco's tailing glenn, we're fucked. tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
do i look like i need your money.  it doesn’t work like that and i can’t tell you why.
well, i wouldn't say --
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. they were both masters.
wasn't my style. we're a rescue unit, not assassins.  this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what's so important?
no, you're not.
honey, i can't track of all the meals charlie and i have been having.  this is a delicate time. if it leaks out that i'm jumping ship before i'm set up someplace else i could be out on my ear before i'm ready with nothing. with <u>nothing</u>.
god, i hate falling asleep in the afternoon. now i'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
walter, what are you doing?
would you like a drink?
he probably thinks he's saving you from something.  i'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
llewelyn.
tickets to malkovich?
it was just a soldier. i was trying to punch his major in the eye.
complete washout.
oh, that randolph hunt. you remember randy hunt, annie. he was in the choir with you.
the recovery? oh , yeah! hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
poor mickey -- when i think of him all by himself in that jail in havana --  -- want to see his picture?
now you've done it. you've given me nervous indigestion.  anything else bothering you, boys?
i gotta listen to it if they think...
'bye, mama...
this! meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... i wish you wouldn't even come.
!! ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- i want ya outta the house -- enjoy ya friggin' life... ya hungry, rock?
soon as mrs. oberfeld is in my car i'll toss out your first third. then i'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
yeah.
this is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
why?
oh, you still want it? even though uhh...
hey buddy... let her go...
the girl's dead, driscoll. there's no point continuing on.
a night in the hole?
but this is impossible.
eighty million doll --- ?
besides, what do we say about the robbery?  no excuse for that.  no such thing as justifiable robbery.
sir, you don't have to worry about me. i'm not the sort to cry out. shall we go in?
thank you very much.
wow. you must have 20,000 lines of code there...
let's forget who said what to whom...
do cagney. like you did yesterday.
yes.  i looked.  i remember clearly now.  it seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  i was scared.
hey, don, how's the high blood pressure.
yeah! life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
why come to me?
but i have had much practice.  as a child in the west, a platoon lived with us.  they'd let me play with their weapons.  the scabbard is so beautiful.
oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
i don't know how to walk in heels.
this operation is in two phases. recon and rescue.  you are phase one.  your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of american pows, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
there out on a call, perhaps i can help you-
that angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
then you can have the disks and i'll just walk out that door --
fucking "a" it is!  any argument and i'm out of here.
have you seen him with someone?
yes, that's right.
careful! watch his hand.
i ain't your partner, i'm your manager. i'm managing to get your money out of mexico, into america, in your hands, and i'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. that makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
need some advice, huh.
i didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
i am prepared to do that anyway.
i'm investigating the death of fredrica bimmel. who are you, please?
aw.
okay, mr. laird. explain this to me like i'm a four year old: did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
a ticket home,
he was... like him.
in rome, about three weeks ago.  i knew that one.
hi, jennifer.
hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  you might learn something.  now i got--
i don't blame you.  what man would? i admit it, okay?  i came back here and i made it with grace.  but if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
i got lots of presents.
you'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
yes. are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand's?
i made it go down the toilet.
i have someone for you to play with junior.
that's okay. you're driving.
why you're just a girl.  what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
i can't give you your damn money back on this.
they don't?  then why do they still write me fan letters every day. why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  because they want to see me, me, me!  norma desmond.
what's that fucker ever done for us?
people think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. otherwise we wouldn't do it. after all, we're not fucking stupid. at least, we're not that fucking stupid. take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. when you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. got no money: can't get pished. got money: drinking too much. can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. got a bird: too much hassle. you have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
we think it might.  that's why we brought you here.  we've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
nothing really worthwhile.
what was the part?
howard --
alright.
crying? why was she crying?
gotta go?
what? what do you mean?
yeah, i guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  maybe rudolf got the same idea.  dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
no...
i'm sorry. i can't sit with you.
however, it's within my power to grant you a reprieve.  that is why i summoned you here tonight.  tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
at some point a man's got to get serious about his future. i'm sure you have no idea what i'm talking about.
yah, ya know it's the radisson, so it's pretty good.
do you want something else, honey? we order something else?
the council has ordered a halt to the ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
why would he do that?
listen, i'm not feeling well.
yes, yes.  it's just that john is so much nicer. jack sounds so ... crude. when i was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named jack. i guess i just can't help making the association.
the truth is, the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense.
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk...?
i thought... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
improved...how?
oh, yeah. oh.  oh! alvy?
would you like part of this? ....it's not much.
so max, what do you do with all your money?
no offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
okay, let's go.
liet?
someone stole my car.
you ... i can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  you get me in here ...
that sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, i guess it's okay.
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
what?
leave me alone.
i had to see you.
very nice...
there's nothing we can do. she had the key.
so speaks the court jester.
c'mon, man!
what lesson do get outta that story, lula?
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. i don't know where...
length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
what?! we follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
go on.
a chip. goes in a computer.
what's he do?
please, except my humblest apologies...
and you wrote that...
if you don't sleep, you don't dream. if you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
the song.  are you sincere with me, fredo?
i thought so. you help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. that way everybody gets what they want. you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico. everybody's happy.
what? why the hell did he do that?
thursday.
we'll get caught.
lead the way.
tell george and jessica to try and cover everything without tom having to ask additional questions.
hammer?
yes.
i don't think we should meet again.
listen...maybe i can get you a year.
so i'll see you at the rehearsal.
you shit.  who do you think you are?
-- made.  made.  marvin gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
what the hell's going on?
serves me right for asking a direct question. the subject is closed.
yes i do.
yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
it's all right. you can write your own ticket. a hundred and fifty bucks a week.
okay, let's go... i got nothing for the record yet.
what's up?
closer to eight.
floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
i think it's the most exciting --  we're going to see things no one ever saw before. the actual physical process of life itself -- not something under a microscope... just think of it --
whose tuba is that anyway?
what does it mean?    i...i mean we, you have other tactics...
buzzy... buzz...?
look pal, i'm just askin' how you...
thank you, but i can wait.
no.  it didn't.
oh, god.
i got some more business for ya.
cooper...
tough guy.  what are you--how's your head.
no!  i don't want you to go to the police!  there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
that requires me goin' out tonight?
oh, all right.
psychology. they're trying to unnerve us.
how come?
all the more reason.
that i wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. at least you'll know i've been telling the truth.
dad.
what's going on?
that machine --
oh, yes.  and the man from your dreams.  lothos.
... you know, chauncey, there's something about you... you're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. you don't play games with words to protect yourself. i feel i can speak to you frankly... you know what i was talking to you about last night?
good... it looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so i think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
claire.
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
name?
okay, just calm down. he could hurt us, brother. he could ruin the whole thing.
so what was he?
why are you--i fought for you with honor.  why should it matter if i'm a man or a woman, as long as i'm a good warrior.
yeah, and i was thinking, sooze, you could do the cover.
that you... you don't even know the guy.
tonight we've been invited to a reception at the presidential palace; to bring in the new year. you and i will go in a special car that's being sent.  they'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the president.  when it's over, it will be suggested that you take questadt and his friends from washington to spend the night with some women.  i'll go home alone in the car; and before i reach the hotel, i'll be assassinated.
i know, but it wasn't all bad was it? i think you found it quite pleasurable.  oh so soft.  so sensual.
uh-huh.
cousin eugenie, my father, but...
by your leave, mr. president -- the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
what's going on?
who is it?
my condolences.
you're up!  you must be feeling better --
and those were your scissors found sticking out of mrs. sterner's stomach, weren't they?
really?
well - ?
i'm all right.
-- but at least aunt may's okay now. i really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
i'd eat a lot of red meat.
i want to thank you.
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
and you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
why did she have to show up now?
they're just doing what they do.  well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
i'm sorry, but do i know you --
what did you find out?
colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  there must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
hey, just shut up.
go!
i never promised you anything.
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  are you god?
yeah?
once you're in it, it warms up.
don't count on it.
good wages, eh! pickin' oranges an' peaches?
what the fuck's going on?
got it.
suppose we do.
hello.
no, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
your sex life?
you still know.
hello?
hi.
i would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
his escape.
i just thought we should talk about it.  between ourselves.
it's good to see you.
-- what were they doing there?
look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for medevac work on this -- uh operation brute force -- they just brought it back this morning.
can't make enough axe-heads!
none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
what's happening to me? why am i getting so much weaker?
military record?
this is sensitive. your car. lovely car. doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
no!  no -- no!  here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back toto.
lovely sound- they seem happy.
to freedom.
like normal folks.
[i'm professional. i just do my job.]
now i’m worried...just say it.  whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
i just wish he never brought it up. ricky won't shut up about it.
you know her?
god damnit! will you stop doing that?!
a gun? yes.
yeah.
four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? do you have any idea what the odds are?
yeah, julie, i'm sorry.  i just thought...there was an earthquake, i think.  little one, but...
you know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
my bed, gone! am i to freeze to death?
right <u>at</u> him?
why?
she called me brad.
i hope you like it.
my heart stays here.
that's right.
do not try your trickery on me!
ann, you always underestimate me.
if it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
he mentioned it.
no.
this wouldn't happen if he was with you. i mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. i totaled three cars in fives years.
you weren't.  thanks.  how does it feel being here?
there's something through that wall!
i was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but i guess she found you.
he's fine. but i'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
where's sarah? where are the boys?
you said nazi low-riders...?
following is different. i was spying.
we should play some time... i mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
they look nice, i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? i might get laughed at. how much do you want for these muskets?
we must blow the first note... he note that will take us to asgaard...
never found out.
six month stint on datus.
after your father's death, you were orphaned. what happened next?  i don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, clarice.
but...
yes, sir.
this is from three years ago. some difference, huh?
willya lemme talk for chrissake? i'm trying to tell you what happened.  what happened is...
me?
probably not.
like what?  i got a little power, sure. a touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  but no more than you do.  we're not witches.  i can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. besides, maybe they deserve it.  maybe we all do.
good evening, lieutenant.
of course we're ready. we've taken all the classes. the nursery. the books --
i bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
what?
what they like?
professor. well, not exactly, professor. you see, we don't point it at the sun.
you don't know halfdan the black.
drive a man to drink.  took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
herbie! wadda you doing here?!
does this sound weird?
that's if we win.  if we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, kicks.
much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deep-browed homer ruled as his demesne.
i guess he misses a lot of dinners.
no.
we better make it, or sport'll get mad. how do you want to make it?
you're single?
they know they failed to kill benes. security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. we're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
i have no idea.
"o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
gone.  destroyed.
oh captain, my captain, we came here so i could talk to you about something.
when was he... created?
wooo.  jealously rearing its ugly head.
will you wait for me?
they wouldn't let me in so i had to get you out.
cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. you must sneak over zere and shut it off before i return with terrance and phillip or the alarms will sound and i will be shot full of holes. got it?
yeah? what three words, harry?
where shall we put it? in the back?
nikita?
could have...
yes, i can see your problem, mr kinnear.
this one , lance?
he doesn't mean anything by it, zack. do you, joe?
electricity.
do you want to try your father again? 
so i'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains?
and the pennies?
my salvation is to die a knight of the round table.
hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, baxter?
sometimes when i'm lonely.
mrs brown.
no. the pill will be for birth control. but girls do like sex. maybe not the first time.
keep your change.  bus three-twenty-three. leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
<u>you jerks</u>!  that is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  you think i want to die like that?  lydia.  moving is a family affair. so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs.
well?
hey. tits. i'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
come on, we're next.
didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
i was so bored!
tell me about it.
you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
is this david's doing?
you and harry'll make a great team.  i'm gonna make a deal with him.
okay. don't worry about it. it's okay.
i'm not even wearing any drawers. forget about a belt.
been crying? that won't please your daddy. you'd bettor cheer yourself up.
they're from both of us.
that's an old one.  one of our first.
don't worry. we'll take care of it.
i was going to fix you breakfast.
oh, yes, sir.
forgive my indulgence. seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. the point is, mr. odets here has written a wonderful play. most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
i know but that was news. this is blackmail and i don't like blackmail.
hey freddy, what's goin' on boy. i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
you see the three-quarter socket?
it's the other way around. the society sent me through med school.
i think that's... {he starts to rise, and the meeting begins to break up) starling, i'm sure these gentlemen...
this is for you to figure out. you can have it your way or you can have it his way.  but you can't have it both ways.  am i right, sonny?
oh yeah?
you went behind my back and you cut me out.
ripped off. by hand, my guess. perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
flynn... you can't... i
yeah, sorry about that.  i had this meeting with this guy.
what do you expect, bertrand russell? i've been a cabbie all my life, what do i know?  i don't even know what you're talking about.
jake, don't go out there. call the sheriff.
what?  how about a drink?
you were making a generalization about "broads!"
coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. if i'm late, i don't suit up.
where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? goin' over my head?
well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
he ... he wants me to help him skip town.
can you walk ?
this concrete?  this is still america.
take me home.
yeah.
of siegfried...
where?
oh. where d'you want the coffee?
if i was to think...if i were to think... no i mean i have thinked it over...i have. and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just...well i just...
ted...the reason i wanted to see you...i want billy back.
sandy? could i talk to you a minute?
a zillion, huh? that's a lot.
do you know where you are?
you want me to hold him down?
unbelievable.
i know, it's very exciting.
who do you like in the opening game, sam?
in my quarters, uhura.
so, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
how romantic.  with fiona i fell over every five minutes.  ronnie christened me lady downfall.
yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
[so am i, sister.]
i was dubious myself at first. then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones...
yes, sir.
i wish i could help in some way, sidney.
randy, c'mon!
oh no! oh, i'm so sorry. truly!
for going to school?
contributions from boys who read about your camp.
one day you will learn to respect other people's time, lydia, one day you --
it's true.  never happen in cracow, though, we all love you too much.
the king.
what?
it's hard to lose ...
...well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  and surfers are territorial.  they stick mostly to certain breaks.  if we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the ex-presidents surf. you buyin' this?
i'm not saying that.
come, sweetheart. let me put it on you. you will teach these jewels. for the first time they will learn how they can look.
four bits.
this service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
i know that.  i know you would have done anything to find me.  i know you would have died for me.
i don't care what you say. i'm going to find bruce's mother.  oh-h...  i'm going out and find her!
excuse me, sir.  treasury dept... i'd like to ask you a few questions.
oak?
yes, i guess it is a little too far ahead. well, let's see. what about the engineer? why can't he marry us on the train?
no.
what?
and the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  seeing that his type is o negative.
have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
you tagging them...?
i... no.
mr. spicoli?
oh, when'd you quit smoking?
ready, sir.
rosalie, you okay?
that's what life is, doctor. full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
i have never heard one.
you call that john travolta/denny terio shit dancing? i wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
so you've not lit the last four boilers then?
where are the tapes?
well, mrs. hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. but not many people walk away from double pneumonia, madam, not many.
you go set down by the river.
take care.
use more ice.
what?
not anymore.
it seems that the english care more about you than the french.
"you're still here?"
everybody's a big shot.  well, leo, are you having a good time?
they treating you alright?
oh, yeah.
see that patch of shirt? we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate. nobody around here had ever heard of it.
tomorrow.  at lunch.
that fish smelled strong.
well.
you think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! we're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever a or lever b, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  all the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
sixty.
i saw paul leaving.    did you do the dirty deed?
... give me a break, mary.
you get nothing and like it.  and if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
yeah only i wish they had the sister on more.
well you can try, can't you, to be good?
shelly's sick...i have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
we were going together before i ever let go of you.
all my model planes.
well, what it was... i, i don't want to admit it, but, you know, i was jealous of pony.
i'll tell her i spent the night with a friend.
no gun.  how disarming.
just watching you.
i'm fine.
they could put you back in the tube..
let's see: you got victor, stud of the year, more coin than god?  or reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  hmmm, it's a toss-up.
jeanne, calm down.  you can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
i'll send you some comic books.
yeh, i think so.  i gave the kay- ducer a c-note.  you find out the deck?
tonight i want to relax with you. the senator from nevada is here with some people from washington. i want to show them a good time in havana.
you haven't talked to him.
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
is that a game?
how much do i owe you?
well, yes.  i suppose i am a bit anxious.
screaming isn't all right. not in my house it isn't.
we shall want a full autopsy ...
good evening, mr. baxter.
you're an extraordinary man.
no fighting. it wasn't bob's fault.
will you get her for me?
are you all right?
we've already been inspected.
what's the matter?
on moss, as he walks the groggy schumann toward the gas station.
did you give him a full cavity search?
hasta siempre.
george, that is so kind of you.
hey, sailor boy, you wanna fuck lula's mama?...
it is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
they do indeed.  daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but i don't care. it was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
i can... feel it moving around inside me. you've got to kill me.
we don't even have a dog!
i don't care what you say about him. the boy has got it bad.
but aren't you the least bit curious about it, doctor?  doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
i'm sorry. you're right.
stay out of it, sefton.
if we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
it's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
no, it's like a safety. we are going to have to access the manual controls.
yeah, that was honza's idea, i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
please... be cool.

'love will find out the way'.
nobody's too busy.
i've been seeing johannsen in chemistry.
you sure you don't wanna stay?

oh great! he tried to kill me! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you.
oh, jesus, please... please, god.
no.
look, if you're going to keep bitching, macready -- palmer's offered to take him up...
heard there was some excitement.
... can't you see...?  if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth. nothing could stop it!  nothing!
i don't know why they even bother. she's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
what?
howdy, mr. stone. we've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the grange?
i don't want to eat it.
hold your tongue.  you don't have that much love.
mr. bringsly, i'm sorry. i have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
can you see light?
i-i-i-i-i'll g-g-g-go, m-m-mack...
i have little interest in your quaint vessel, captain. if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
you wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
i thought it was dave.
come on, ma. out with it. who came out first?
nice view, huh?

client?  i like to think of myself as more of a friend.  a mentor.
it was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. they received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  and the ship vanished from all our scopes. no radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. they disappeared without a trace.  until now.
where?  everywhere, major.  everywhere.
so you figure you're still my manager, huh?
al capone!
after you -- mrs. peel ...
sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-i'm- not-nad' message.  not after the way we broke up.
what was that?
what next?!  -- a strange bra under my pillow!
sometimes i get a ride with my brother. but he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
it's on the table.
let's just keep going.
gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
so you can shoot a pistol?
you can't be serious? hey listen, my bonnie-and-clyde days are over.
err...the supreme court story, i was telling you - justice black.
maybe it's because i live here.
i want to sit beside you tomorrow.
could it be intelligent?
rheya...
it never rains but when it pours --
you're doing great with her.
lose the hardware now.
evolution doesn't work that fast. something pushed that thing to take the leap. we need to find another specimen.
the idiot?

she's well, too.
sense memory. i see you got to win the fight...
joe could help him. if we can get in touch with joe, joe could get him to a doctor, joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
lula, sometimes i gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
you and he are not doing things?
well, of course, i'm sure you're a gentleman.
a salesman! cool hand luke a salesman?
ok. what should i do about eric?
jesus, eddie, is this who i think it is?
no more rhymes now, i mean it.
it's obviously him!
i'm all ears, good buddy.
i told you not to bring the other one.
i'm sorry, uncle, i came to tuck you in.  and...
there's nothing wrong with ... that.
we better get back to the sub. every second counts now.

so let's go.
i don't know.  extra apartment keys. what's it matter?
what if your father snapped? your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  no coolants to preserve food.  millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
why pick on him ?
yeah. come on. it'd be fun.
sir, if i may ... echo my concern ...
polaris, where are you?  maybe i'm too far south.
i see.  and this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  a sort of retroactive abortion?
then why hide behind a mask?  you are ashamed!
four? there are five.
is it my turn again?
maybe they needed it.
i don't think we should discuss this until i'm a little bit more composed.
no.
he's a reality television producer. his name is mark weiss.
do you like kissing me?
look.  maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  maybe i'll never see either of you again. i don't know.  all i know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
mercedes gonzales ruiz.
if they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?

is that alright, frank?
hello.
your... lover?
your perfect. your bitter and you're strong.
we spent it!
sir, do you have a problem?
"this is miss vale." -- that felt redundant.

...the coroner's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

you don't say?
test of manhood.

philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
uh, oh.
i'm marrying debbie.
i, umm, came to see you.
i was stoned. that's why they stopped me. when i'm not stoned, i got no place else to go. they just protect me from myself.
well, for one, i read. i don't watch as much television as you. i'm trying to feel things more. i'm learning a lot about people.
actually, it didn't come from me.
that's impossible. you're the only one who could have it.
i remember the first time we met. do you remember that?
i think you're on the right track.
so.  you found him.
what is it?
jon, this is goddam insane. you can't go through with it.  what about eve?
not at all. the place is totally deserted.
toothache.

you--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
i'll just say that we had a great night together.

okay, save your batteries!
whew!  i'm glad that's over with.

where's bella?
hey —— i'm over here.
we've had thefts of our new stuff ...gruner deals in this... a big deal is going down now. i went to see if gruner had anything to sell. but he didn't make any moves...and when you arrived, he backed off.
now...now, i'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  it's just... i was happy.  why get me involved? you told sen that you weren't satisfied with me.
yeah, better run, you bastards!
was that swann's idea?
good.  that is what i hope.  i did not think you a bugger too.  i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
with lots of ketchup?
ed, how're you holding up?
oh yeah?  what did i get?  what did i get i couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  you think your company is such a treat?  your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... you think you're entertaining?
okay.  but what if i'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  to smell a flower?
god, it's wonderful to see you. where's greg?
just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
don't be a good neighbor to her or i'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. you know what a love letter is? it's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. understand, fuck?
no, you don't understand. she's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
you want me to put it here?
but why, gray? why?
doctor gynde, my whole family's sick. what's going on?

saber tooth tiger!
he unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
let's move into this neighborhood.
you mean that body-----?
that's right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
it doesn't make sense. these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.

i'm quitting, frank. as of midnight tonight.
oh, ben - i miss you so when i'm out... how are you feeling?
you want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? i can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
oh no.  they're trying to blame you for the accident.  that means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
what can you see?
it'll be all right.  trust me.  and keep your eyes open.  you wait here.
what's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?

what can we do to assist you?
i just went there for a job.
i have no idea what you're talking about.
i'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
but what about the past? our past?

david reynolds, i'm the manager here. sit down, john.
something bad happened here, murphy.

maybe you're right.
...and rob the place...

he's allergic to everything.
get away from me... get away!  she means that much to you, you stay with her.  but you come back, you come back for me.  not for tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
i bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
i was sorry to hear about your wife.
jennifer desiderio, for one.  she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.

but if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for blanche.  if you ask for monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
is that right?
merle?
no, but i have the feeling i'm about to find out.
betty! boy, am i glad to see you!

any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
i'm afraid that's not so, sir.
brother. i cannot move.
you make friends quickly, don't you, clark?
mmmhmmm.
we're gonna be here a week?
mrs. clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  we're not accustomed to the company of women.
who were you talking to?
you'd try anything.  i got first dibs.  you get ya own stuff.
oh... i'm fired?

i'll boil some water.
i'm happy to help you all i can. but i didn't see the accident and i barely knew daniel zavitz. i've gotta go to work.
it's no place for you, bob. think of what's waiting for you. do you want to stay here until you're half dead? until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
it was fifteen seconds.
shut up!
who are "they?"
i knew him.  probably one of the few he knew him as william turner. most everyone just called him bill, or 'bootstrap' bill.
didn' you get no sleep?
i am a god!  a god!
drink!
alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
you've been without water for a whole day. let's see how thirsty you get in a week.

i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life!  nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
i think you're getting a little moody there, eddie.
but lots of our people don't read, man. they need strong imagery to help them out.
she sure does.
i was alone a lot as a child.  no one to compete with.  my parents ensured that i found happiness in the smallest things.  when you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  you don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
you are very good in the world history class, yes?
pulse detectors.
look, he's temperamental.
was it the same oswald, dave, that was in dallas, or was it an impersonator.
mmmmmmmmm.
twice.
kane.  do you have mr. john michael kane?
not for me.
i know you're out there!  answer the goddamn call!
take it easy, walter.
she'd punish me.
five hundred.
you didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
she did—?
come on, jack, shall we go?!!
susie?  susie.  are you alright...?  <u>susie</u>...
mr. freeze.
no, doofus... blow it out!
who's strickland?
i came to see you, charles, about your - about the enquirer's campaign against the metropolitan transfer company.
it's already two hours... what are we going to do?
it sounds like you.
now then, mrs. kramer, you said you were married seven years. is that correct?
i'm here, sir, i just - i don't know how to feel about it.
this song's for peggy.  and all you others out there a little down on your luck.
well, do you?
i knew you'd know.
young man, i already told you she's not here.
--but i think the thought has crossed your mind.
after fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  you can deal with anything.
hello!  hello!  have a good flight?
directing suits you.
you could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  she anything like your ex?
have i been a good wife?
all you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? some chick?
there are other doctors...yes, other doctors...better doctors...
what?
and what was your answer?
you've never told anyone who he is?  but you'd have to tell me if i asked you.  tell me.
the bed looks like a dead animal act. which one is sables?
it's november.
jean-luc picard.
perhaps a little refreshment first? a little coffee, or a little chocolate?
you didn't see this.  understand?
you wanted to, or you are?
learn what?
back to the ship, huh?
you gotta go with it. scary movies are great foreplay.
help me live until i die?
well i...i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
we will practice in the mornings, my boy, and i'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. what was that?
sure plan to.
mmm.
it's nothing. just a list -- it's not finished --
hippy, you pussy.
where do you live?
if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  you know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
okay, i'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
did you just make that up?
i know.  you ever work with ghosts, case?
where will you find such a girl?
...ixed itself.
sure ...
and such puny scope! nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
 excuse me...
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
aw, fuck.
i don't want this. yuri, please. i really don't want this. you know i don't like to do groups.
...i have to stand up for her...
cool, isn't it?  weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  on the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
hello, lieutenant.  good to see you.
like a real sister?
there’s a guy on 81st and madison. you get your results in 24 hours.  do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
officer white.  i heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
can't do it.
if you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
leon! what in heaven's name...!
we're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
what is it with this chick?  she have three tits?
i'm a fool.
i mean he's of your race. he's an ape.  look.  you don't have to be afraid.  we've put him in chains and under sedation. do you understand that?
reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
then we'll open it in detroit or dallas or kalamazoo for god's sake! we'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
excuse me, wichita, i can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. could you...
and you're a fool, toddy -- and no doctor. it's only the dead ones that you know.
welcome. 38
so did this one. wambli is a rare and sacred creature. when someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. we share everything. a lot of power in the eagle feathers. but you think that's bullshit too, don't --
i sent the document forward to sandefur. i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
because, growing up, books were my world.
who did he ask for?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  this is a...why?  why would you do that?
she's been like that ever since the fire swamp.  it's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
muchas gracias.
let me have a beck's.
i'm not sure that it is the plague.
the western woods.
you want me to come with?
slowly or quickly?
eddie, can we do that?  can we go skiing?  we can use my uncle's boat.  eddie?
but you needed a drink first.
don't you have a kiber crystal?
great game. red sox are winning.
so what i want to do is stop it here. i'm going to make him an offer. i want to do it myself. i want it to come from me.
in english.  i'll fuck your brains out.
and now you have everything.
... your one chance for true happiness?
you are truly magnificent!
mr. masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  pg&e is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
sarah.
have her come up.
i don't want it.
are you all right?
no, it won't work and i just realized why.  there's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. only one of us could survive.
i believe you have a message for him?
your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
did she throw up?
meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
i need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  meet the people.
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now.
you really think he'll remember you?
maybe if i used my left....
how'd you know i wouldn't?
miss beaufort has accepted our invitation.  by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
could it have been in the mercedes?
how did you get into the store?
but wait, there's more. with a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, i can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
well... i mean... what am i supposed to say here, bern?  is this a riddle or what?
i've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  this man hadn't been dead an hour.  he wasn't killed last night.  he was killed today. in broad daylight.  that's no drunk- rolling job.
you mean that "load" of passengers?
nothing.  so good luck.
jack, i don't trust you, and that's a fact.  never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
can i talk to you a minute?
yeah.
how long will you set it for this time?
now let's not get into a big hassle-
well, destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, i dare to coin.
but obviously you still care what happens to him.
oooooooops!
you get to be a little chelsea clinton. everyone wants to meet you. party with you. have sex with you.
7 to 2.  that ain't bad.
washington?
you're like an undercover guy!
mr. gittes! that's an outrageous accusation.  i don't know what you're talking about.
what does leto say, piter?
whistler!
would you? actually, you could.
are you ready for me?
you're right, that was ordell. you have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
stop being so fucking melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
...no money.
but we do have one advantage.  he needs your blood to live. he might come after you first.
well, you want to or not?
i'm going with you.
what about my orange juice?
don't take it to heart, betsy.
okay.
he said if martin's interested, i could get a half a million for it easy. but don't worry, harry, i'm still giving you until friday.
just for the first year.
shhhh... it's all right... also, i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
your little jack-in-the-box gun. that might be useful.
look, i don't know what else i can say. i'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. but it's important to start early. i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a field's medal.
i am...
who?
listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. isn't that enough?
keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. don't break it.
he is.
dylan here.
jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not josie grossie anymore.
she's dead?
how can i tell you what i don't know!
once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  iíll call you from paris.
what is it?
that's why i'm asking.
"...did." well, okay.
our time's up.
i wasn't a manager here then mrs steckler - don't you remember?
i know him. that's noel.
the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. that's a known fact. if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
whenever i start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and... i feel better.
no. i have the ring. was i supposed to have a pre-nup?
you remember me?
where is everyone?
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy, collect the big guns from the towers. watkins, put general owen with the wounded. rico, where's my communications ?
spider-man, be careful!  he's quite mad.
exactly. and once you'd killed him you'd be lost. like me.  all this has to be a choice. otherwise...it's a curse.
i can't just hack my way inside.  there's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  i'd have to be physically at the terminal.
you will not, then?
tough.
what about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
may i lift my eyebrows?  what is this?  what are you trying to do?
you're what?
i don’t care who you are.  it’s christmas and like i told you the building is closed.
for about one year.
alright, roach, see you around.
comrades! comrades!
i don't want a steak.
don't worry, we'll find her.
...or death.
we're building up tourism, sam--
i suppose it's... i mean define your terms.
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling, they try to shoot it off.
no.  he smokes.
are you proud of me, bill?
any other i.d.s come up?
francesca?
i'm sorry about what i said, really i am. just take me with you, i don't care where.
it's wood. it's fake. five years ago i was engaged to be married. johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn't paying attention. the slicer chewed off my hand. it's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that i was maimed, she left me for another man.
i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too.
you understand i knew harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
i think he's high on drugs. he hit me, then took off. i'm afraid to be alone. please come over.
mummy!
the baron is tired?
sooner or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  you always do.
your life will never be the same.
so what'd the other guy look like?
no, chinese food is fine.
you read it off your fucking photo. you don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
they fear change.  the new caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  you could be the one, the emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the republic.
excuse me?
you're incorrigible!... aren't you?
god, i can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
i wanna be on the task force, daniel.
me? oh, i didn't have no plan. still don't, really.
harry? harry, where are you?!
i came all the way here for that? to walk the lobby?
ann, do you see a pattern here?
could it have damaged the ship?
all right. that's your opinion. you're entitled to it, but --
like little children.  you okay?
you better not miss, friend.
what, are you a klansman or something?
i really can't give out any information right now at this point.
yeah? must be danny-boy. i lost him in the last race.
i'm cleaning my stove.
yes, they are. you're out of shape.
when arthur built the castle, i carved out a place for myself, where i could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
lissen. this wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
v'asitem...
alan stanwyk.
there isn't enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy. 
you hold great hope for this meeting.
what do you think about all this?
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  odorless. undetectable by dogs.  undetectable by anyone.
you okay?
i'm engaged for the evening.
back in the '80's. you didn't see the pictures? they were from before she got famous. she was hairy as hell. her pits, her bush.
did you know he was hanging around julia?
i wouldn't do that.  the doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
don't you gamble?
it's okay. you need me?
if you believe that.
how?
well... let me tell you, i'm not luke.  i know who i am now, and you don't.  and... i don't like me very much.
joey?
we have henekin, kirin... very good, sir.
a slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
wait a minute!--they're dancing in the palm court--
don't name them.  just tell me if you know.
for loyalty, you buy a dog.  for love, you get married.
miss swann.
huh?
aaron was in the dream.  a dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
michael, it's wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on su...
i want to know what happened.
that's too scary.
here, are you always this sarky?
jean, your parents are here.
i'd stake my reputation.
for that matter, i think you will too.
they're right here.
how close are you?
guy with a routine goes and breaks it? provokes attention.  that's bad.  and that's not good...
what say we turn up the heat?
it's not going to be fine. it's --
has anything been simple so far? from the look of the shovel, we dig.
i don't know if i want to be doing this.
then when?
myers has been locked up since before she was born. he's never laid eyes on her.
but you're going through with it?
hey, king.  somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
he'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
why?
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction.
don't you have any savings?
and an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
everybody is at home, it's no good.
we didn't do so bad after all.
no, i don't.
i'm gonna go out for a little while.
no.
when you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
you don't happen to know how i can get around an irq/3 do you?
who's the pilot?
you'll learn.
that's it.  i got it all written up. ready to go. all i want is a thousand dollars.
why doesn't palmdale p.d. just raid the guy?
all right, i get it. i have bad teeth. you have to understand, in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. it didn't matter.
the boy _died_?
slaves are made in such ways!
business thing.  gimme a seven and seven, willya?
we could've had three weeks in florida - all expenses paid.  lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
to explode, of course.
is hooper coming to dinner?
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
may you what?
so, whatever happened to her?
no nuns, got it.
it's funny, you know, you get a picture of the corporation-type company man, all business...this man, no.  we'll go out to his home sometime.  let's see.  tomorrow.  no.  tomorrow, i'm in l.a....monday...i'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
i couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
good answer.  same goes double for me.
i didn't buy it i made it.
they murdered her, mrs. mathews, i'm sorry.  it happened a month after she ran away.  she's been dead all this time...
i understand.
be quiet! get lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
i've took as much of you as any man can you've lost your heart
and... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
i'm sorry, dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "tina," it's seiko.
no!
you are false data.
i don't know.  probably ignore her.
how'd you get this number?
what a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
ah, you gotta be jokin'!  a great man like you... i'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
gordon what i want--and i never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. i want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. it's gonna make us a fortune!
god, look at this place, it's the town that dreaded sundown.
my fowl have polluted the yard.
pacqualinincheewa root.  means "cougar fang." cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
precisely.
suit yourself, kid. this isn't for me to decide. of course, you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning.
what do you know about dating a single mother?
gracious, gracious! you are a good woman, miz cooper!
hey, mikey--
charged?
girl, what are you doing?
he's -- with the c.i.a. -- i've seen him at the embassy.
why are we going here, jimmy?
captain?
no you don't! you don't want any broads with boots on!
no. i have two. the other one is the one i'm looking for.  what's this?  it's from my grandmother.
who found him?
what isn't wrong? why are you doing this anyway?
who do you think did it?
then we have to find a safe port around here.  got any ideas?
i only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
well, i guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
i... found that rock.
the law's on our side. if they want to challenge it, let them try.
no, wait... please... listen...
don't i even get my face slapped?
were you with him last night?
what?
jani! where are you?
sure!  but we think it's kickass! now i get to be tony.  i get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
don't i look like i'm listening?
but i was with him the whole time.
hi! gale weathers. field correspondent, inside story.
... i see.
gus, have you ever been in love?
take it easy, you won't lose him now.  we had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  believe me, i've seen enough to know.
what will this prove?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
hm?
hello, operator services.
what did who say?
i still haven't made up my mind yet.
everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a samo tag on it.  the other day, i just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. a week later this gallery calls me up: "somebody's offering us the drawing. should we buy it for five thousand?"
who told you to do that?
first you've got her buying your file.  now you've got her killing nilsen.  forget her, willya?  go someplace.  sit in the sun.  get away from this goddamn fog.  get her out of your system.
pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. he's a good little kid.  er, guy. man.
well, sort of. vanessa likes madison for a girl.
parasite!
soon as i finish.
oh.
the last one, please.
have you consulted a psychic?
i can't say i know patrick all that well.
yup.
let me get this straight. jerry nathan owes you money. so, as collateral, he gives you his car.
so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
i don't know. she won't talk about it.
why is that?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger, buckaroo.  what's it like out there in the real world?
get out.
you did save my life!  and it's <u>me</u>! i'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! i'm a reporter, john, an experienced professional...  i...
i've heard of it.
oh, yeah... the explosion.
white perch.
no.  i want to show you.  is it ruined?
david, do you want me to stay here tonight?
oh, god!  oh god!
okay, bye.
what happened?!  jesus, connie, what did you do?
you talk just as addison said you did.
hey, wait!
-- yeah.
danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember domingo, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
keep still, constable.  you were half-drowned when they found you.
you get quick action, don't you?
are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
now what?
you're not on the beat.
less than a mile.  forty-one wagons, a company of redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
he saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
i'm getting her out of there!
i know.
obviously.  one ticket of passage to south america -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
how long did you fuck her?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
because i'm scared, that's why. you never smoked?
why do you hate us so much?
well... yeah...
god of passages and changes?
what's the difference?
no, ben.
what are you doing?
x22. read.
well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
well, what's wrong with it?
i'll see she's there, bruce, i promise you.
okay.
well, dr. lorenson is still here at the hospital. if she was here at the time your father was, then i'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
we're saved!
he's telling me an idea for a movie. it's not bad so far.  sit down, have a drink.  tell karen, let's see what she thinks.
where are thomas and fedens?
why?
yes.
i love her. if she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
baby, you know why? cause it'll never get here.
no -- no, sir.
i don't know. it's not important. i mean, i don't want pupils. they get in the way. i've got to have time for composition.
no. what happened?
i saw it.  faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  his body held it open.
of course you know dean rabin, one of my assistant d.a.s. dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
you don't understand me.
miss farmer! in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here... i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the county jail.
it was an accident.
what did mama tell you? when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
stuttering--
looks like she was holding out.
how are you doing?
you're in the stomach!
stupid!  is wendy hood your girlfriend?
i figured if you were gonna, then i wouldn't have to.
i . . ..
oh no?
i now know more about their affair than i remember about my marriage.  francesca, the last thing i want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- i mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
need any help with those bags, ma'am?
all right, knock it off.
blackjack, nick, blackjack i am good at. i mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? since you worked there?
alice...
you want coffee or something?
yeah. the boss sent me over to offer you a job. he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune.
harry.
don't you understand french?
i wasn't alone.  wasn't frankie ruskin directing the picture you're in?
jane -- for god's sake...  look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
he will.  but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  you've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  and farley's given you that chance.  you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead.
i'm sorry.
no problem.  if i can ask one question.
this is all maybe getting a little too strange --
frank -- stop it!  stop it!
i thought you were bringing the colonel?
and...spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier 17.
hi.
it was misguided and pointless. is your answer yes?
i'd just like to know the true versions of things. events. stories. you.
don't . . . george?
i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
yes. but that's a different...
count me out.
she was more helpful than the fuckin' public defender.  i don't know -- i guess what i need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
whether you like a paradox.  i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
well why are they tearing the building down?
honest.  didn't know where to look till i was 21.
what?
you know what really scares me? living too long. losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. and my brains...sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime tv.
forget it. how would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
you don't need to lose any weight. you're kidding, right? you look great. very fit.
oh - oh, poor dorothy!
thanks for your help... good luck.
i mean it as a compliment. you've got such great taste, i don't know. most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. used to say, the cream of america: rich and thick. freddie's the perfect example.
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i've aquired.  that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg.  but that's where you come in.
i got this little chick i'm tryin' to hit on.  she's about 20, 21... i take her to jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... i says, "hey, this is 1971, baby, i'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
hey, man.
under the circumstances.  charmed to know you, jules.
no! you couldn't imagine -
well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
i'm sorry. i didn't know.
how long...you think?
my real father?  well, he was a flashback.
i could give you a dozen good reasons.
have you sized up the groomsmen, jules?  as m. of h., you get first fuck.  don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
she's like some puritan.
present tense, please. love her. whatever she is. i'm thinking of her now, fergus. will you think of her too?
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice. i think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. i think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
a .357.
where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
that is correct.
that's the beauty of it. there's only one tiny window of time when this will work. at the handover of hong kong--from britain to china. the handover from them to us.
you can?
no, no, not at all... i mean i've still got plenty of time.  don't i?  i mean i still have a good six years, whatever. we could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  and i know i've always said i never wanted kids, and i didn't... but this year, i really, truly, feel ready...
what's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
i never touched your father! i swear!
there's probably some explanation.
what are ya gonna do, call the cops?
but i got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  yessir, i think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  why don't you tell me about your connection.
louis
thanks, lou.

the hall of books.
try to feel it.  use the force...
well, what'd you think?
oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
shall i call the police, sir?
i'm just an m.d.
where you were when your husband died.
yes, now i remember, mr. garrison. i'm sorry, i got confused.  we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  stupid, right?  so of course we didn't get any geese.
what the fuck you think, i wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? yeah you're working. and put down the champagne.
all the more reason to watch him. he's had some wild notions lately.
you invited her to our anniversary party? i didn't even invite my mother.
a few years ago, i actually saw him do "dracula" live.  i thought he was much scarier in person.
we'll exterminate the fuckers !
'commander' decker?
we know three things about man-eaters. first, they always return to where they've attacked before. second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. and third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
hey, things could be worse. it could've been my money. let me help you out, rookie.

dinner?  dinner's difficult.  a phone call?

they got to stop <u>sometime</u>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
what i like about mickey spillane is he knows how to handle women. in one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. and then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. and then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
as chief enforcer of all florin, i trust you with this secret: killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.

i didn't know it was a hit.  i swear to you i didn't know.  johnny ola contacted me in beverly hills -- said he wanted to talk.  he said you and roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if i could help them out. they said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.

i've been thinking...  carla, would you do one favor for me?
is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
there's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. it happened like this before, in 1916, when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach, in long island.
you're my prisoner.
oh, i don't know. either i'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!

in truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
i want you.  to tell the truth.
she may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. i've seen your college record. i've never heard of most of those schools. tell me something, mayo. did you buy that degree?
waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. it's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. the reason is because of tips.
my plan is just beginning.  i'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but i'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses!

what was that?
i reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
uh -- forget that.  look, is that all you're interested in?  ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
you know, sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home. i'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...

please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
you don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

ah, quit griping.  keeps you in shape doesn't it?
hello!
so, where's "weird al"?
buddy, i was horrible. i can't tell you who it was, but do you know what i did? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. why, i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  but to get back serious to what i was sayin', it is not only, buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
this is ogre's magic.
well then.

i didn't beat it; i hid from it. if you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  that's the worst killer of them all.

hold on.  hold on, please.  i need talk to you.
what is it, patrick? are you alright?
you don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?

there's a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  buddy is it?  and this fella jack foley.  i swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
why? from the first, i've terrified you, doctor. and in spite of every sign that i'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. why?
you know.  i don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
you gonna shank him in the shower?
so you know what she does? she's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed.

so.  what happens now?

you like that statue?
you're so good to me. truly. thank you.
<i>chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>

i don't think so.
he swore by it.  what?
engines off.
i'm not trying to tell you he's little lord fauntleroy.
uh-huh. well, this ain't the railroad. now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
i don't think we should have come here. i'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.

yes -- there --
turn yourself in.
you must have some feeling.  some immediate impression.  a young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  and the things that went on in that house.  such wild sex.  what kind of picture does that paint?
as we look up, we see the president biting his lip, and continuing with the speech.
all the time.
you seem uncomfortable.  do i make you nervous, corky?
who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  either way, natalie's still gonna find out.

no. this has been going on for some time . several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body. only parts.
should you see a doctor?
but... if he doesn't miss?
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
stan? what's going on?
so you're just going to give up and go home?
hi, baby.  i've missed you.
let me put it to you this way... whether i'm here... or whether i'm not...i'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
can i help you?
just relax and don't worry about a thing.  i'll hook you up in there.  you got condoms?
i made it clear in my letter to the company.  this is not a position for a frightened girl.

when you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.

that's what gives me the fear.
after breakfast, mister mcmurphy, after breakfast.

french?  damn it, i want my own man on this case.  somebody i trust. somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
that would be fine.
call it a guess...
i expected it to be bad, you know.  i took a human life... but i slept like a baby that night.  i never gave it a second thought.
i have felt him, my master.
i guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  for stealing a horse!  and, you dig up our dead.
well... not exactly.
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
sucked in officers from all over the county. and it was the worst six months this station ever had.
you all right there?
i say it because it's descriptive.
well, dottie, how come they're not here then, fuck-face?
exactly who was this oberfeld?
i... i can't do this.
is it long and hanging down?
yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
where were you? i called at 4:30 this morning.
i'm sorry.  well, we need the money. now we have it.
yeah, i know, i went back and forth on it.
that's your life... not mine.
there, it caught!
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house, i bring with it with me. and i'll feel it every minute we're together. and i'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. and then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
exposure. they can't have it. they wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
mel gordon.
sure am.
a nun?
everything.  i'm a goddamn human-pinata...
and there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish.
i'm here. so is donnie and jack weller. we understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
but that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
you have a lovely voice.
or we could do that yeah.
that's enough.
i know where we could get the money. a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
my dear sir, i would gladly change rooms with you.
listen up. i need directions. downtown. somebody named hershe.
you really think i'm attractive?
we were parceled out, all five of us. i went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. she was in charge.
now's a helluva time to play "what if".
at least it will expose whether khruschev has been overthrown. we'll know what we're dealing with.
it's nice to meet you.  my husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
i don't know! i just said that!
fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
sam--

hey, bomb...
the s.s. men are here to pick up dunbar. they're taking him to berlin. looks like he's finished.
are you finished surfing?
couldn't handle it then. now i can.
relax, son. they'll learn in time that you don't fuck with first bank. this is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. my daddy always told me that only the strong survive.
he said it made sense that gary's code was like teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. said it was all about his own guilt.  plus, he has a tendency to get gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. it always passes.
landon. you go on home.
who was it?
keeps me out of the army.
i couldn't really say. he wasn't circumcised.
i'm so dumb! i <u>deserve</u> to die -
it won't sell.
had to.  to keep him still for the trip.
the empire must have gotten here first.
yes.
tell me something.  why didn't you just take the money off luther and split?
leave him alone.
all right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
he do that to you?
well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
but what?
no, no.  that is where you are wrong. for us, it is cheap.  in medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  in miami, we sell for sixty.
i can’t stay.
kill me and have done with it.
well, hello there...chocolate,
because when i scheduled it i didn't realize it was a holiday.  you were there, why didn't you say something?
yes, i noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  ouch!
really!
you know, i never got to ask you.  where you from, johnny?
wait, mama, wait. i have something to tell you. i've decided... well... i'm not going to make movies anymore. i thought that's what i wanted, and i went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but i was miserable, mama, and it nearly killed me. so now... now it's over. i want a different kind of life, something... simple. i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and i'll have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... it's going to be okay, mama, i know it. and i love you.
ted...?
whiskey!
you're not a film producer, are you?
victor, i'm sorry i --
yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
did she always have nightmares?
we must do this sacred thing, mary robert.
patience doesn't run in our family. sam, i'm going out there!
what is it?
i'm walter peck.  i represent the environmental protection agency, third district.
you don't actually do it that way?
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
are you ready?
what's that got to do with you?
the shack...
hello, miss sessions. i don't believe we've had the pleasure.
that will teach you to trust grandpa.
i want you to stay and find wynant.
how's it going?
you've slept with twelve different girls?
alright, i'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
she thinks so.  what do you do?
i think you better put him on ice, man.
sure.
where will my bed be, where will i sleep?
hey sam. sorry 'bout that.
we provide opera.
i just wait. you know?
i'm gonna kill him. that fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. you got any money?
i could stay here forever...
sooner... or later... i'll have to stop.
well, maybe you missed something?

the big hurt, huh?
but i wasn't here, mr. dickson. honest i wasn't . . .
ed, can i see you a second.
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
hell no!  i'm rolling.  i'm a businessman.  i'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>!  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
just because you knew her?
yeah, i subscribe. it's a pretty decent one.
the bruce is not coming, william.
no.  but i've been to brooklyn.
well...yeah.
then you have no way of knowing what mr. marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits?
i can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
why?
that your gate down there?
what happened?  who gave the order to attack?
no no.  don't cry at the beginning of the date.
and ...your friend?
i won't defend my life to you.
we are totally booked.
freddy -- that's right. i liked that movie. it was scary.
can i help you?
meda.  meda.
no.  please.
quite a bit you didn't tell me.

beloved husband...
mckinley?...mckinley?
he's fine.
yes.
yes!
yeah, it will be fine. i wanna check something out. will you come with me?
scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
i'd swear something was there sir, but i might have imagined it.
what did he look like?
... won't you let us do something for you? your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
then gimme buddy shaw -- he's ranked fifth.
physically, it's not a very demanding job.  the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
how can you tell?
i'm loyal to things that make me happy.
i'm your best friend...you could have told me the truth about what happened. i would've understood.
oh hello.
morning, officer.
dead people.
you don't want to know.
say, you were pretty good. jumping in like that. got a brain, haven't you?
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
the van?
it might be paranoia, but i've never lost my keycard before.
would you like to see the wine list?
we know that you weren't.
really?
i guess i left it in my room.
did you see what mr carroll wrote in my yearbook?  well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "you're a real live-wire, love mr carroll."  y'know, it's all so phoney.
...dad?
he referred to this... the seven dwarfs...
i've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'hawkeye.'
please don't misunderstand me...
i got the money to pay for 'em.
most every day.
says here you done real good in the war: silver star, bronze star, couple purple hearts. sergeant! little time in stockades. come out the same way you went in: buck private.
i sent for  the police.  we can explain.
please sit down. i told your wife. i'm sorry that we have to meet out here. i've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers.
with all due respect, cynthia you're nuts. i'm giving him another month!
because... there was no way to win.
yeah, give him another one. and i'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
you want... a free one.
peter, their hands are tied.  you see that, don't you?
i don't think so.
some, a little.
i'm about to blow the wall.
i'm your future husband, remember?
i'll drink to that.
when did this start?
you know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
right.
you think my sister is there?
i think we've burned off enough fuel. we may be lighter enough to hover. just barely.
we'll still be able to talk when i'm away. the conversation will just keep getting longer.
dude, i finally got the venue i wanted.  i'm performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at crane jackson's fountain street theatre on tuesday night, and i'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
she shouldn't have come back.  she knew she was in danger.
you okay?
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
somewhere in italy.
i was upset.
how would you like the funds?
i think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
i know what everyone knows. try like hell for renewal. you have the same chance everyone else has.
there's a bucket here.
morning mr. north
he's inherited a fortune.
they'll kill us!
but al is your husband now!
i confess i have succumbed to my weaknesses.  an inability to see another's point of view.  i've discussed it with professionals.  even with one of your friends.  she's here now...
all right.
i've seen one of these before. a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. away to fuck the irs. is that what you're doing, or are you the real mccoy?
i want you to tell me a story, tin-tin.
coffee...  two coffees. it says "breakfast any time", right?
there's this native broad works in the laundry. i don't know if you've noticed.
i had ordered some books. "the 100 greatest books ever written."
well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  how did you even know where i was.
shit. we don't know what he is.
you heard? how?
did you see the moon last night?
why should i feel sorry - they're dead.
early eighteenth century. i should say around--seventeen thirty.
uh, william... uh... hendershot.
you don't know who she was, annie --
what do you mean?
i'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
who told you that?
toast?  no...just the butter.
it's all been a dream.
tommy.  come on. relax.
i hear he flies a lot of private charters....
the door needs a lock.
bollock naked with his socks still on?
anybody call?
they're waiting. come on.
hello?
all right.
no, i didn't think so.
a... are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
i thought he was dead.
wow. you're a walking felony.
we were never told flat out "don't talk." but the message was clear.
we're closed.  come back in the morning.
it's just... y'know... i mean...
look. mister --
what's wrong.
yeah, but of course for now, i only get a twenty.
yeah... he was lookin' for you.
what's the matter?  you gotta get back to shaw?
you gotta be kidding.
thank you, bobby.
i know, i know, it's just...
maybe i should start making plans, is that what you think? start planning my memorial service? "begin to prepare for the inevitable."
what does this have to do with my testimony?
you actually listen to all those tapes?
you sure it'll be one of these two?
i don't know.
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
i know you don't. that's the point. i'll say no more.
no of course not.
it sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. i seen hundreds of them - all my life.
i have the white house on the line.
i'm gonna...i'm just gonna stop for a little water.
when?
yes, ma'am.
what you're asking is impossible!
it's a chicago station. i found it the other day.
what am <u>i</u> gonna do?  i'm gonna "fade away."  what are you gonna do?
no, lemme finish.  i don't like this job!  that boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  and susan, like you said, she's growing up.  two heads. what i mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
i want to speak with my daughter!
yeah, but please don't do that.
it means she's screwed up.
i like that thing you're doing with your voice, randy. it's sexy.
i think he wants something to drink.
what kind of god is he to will this?
what's that?
who is this?
i don't understand.
screw you... screw that... don't jerk me around. you promised me 1500 seats for the police concert... 1500, not fifteen!... screw that... screw you -- screw sting.  hi, guys.
you know, general kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of rostopchin's secret police.
and i wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
i hide no pain.
slow down. smell that?
what for?
oh, it breaks the heart.
that's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
thank you.
numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
i want that shark alive.
hello, mr. valiant.  i rang the doorbell, but i guess you couldn't hear it.
what'd he say now?
next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder. an' thursday two yards from cappoli, okay?
it's all there.  both nights.
her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
okay, look.  it's an important meeting. kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
well, that's exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi.
'the cuer-vo gold, the fi-ine columbian.'  you look nice tonight.
not the first time that's been true.  i'm telling you, i got a feeling about this guy.  this is the guy, satch.
yeah.
they don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
my god.  have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
it was the feds. a truck load of guns gets snagged, customs comes down on n.y.p.d. for some answers - they come up with us. they're grabbing at straws. it's politics - nothing you can do.
you look tired....
you knew the lieutenant before the war... what was he like ?
i'm sorry.  about before.
i have spoken to the klingon high council, sir. they identified the bird of prey as belonging to the duras sisters.
sugar or honey?
how are you holding up?
it was incomprehensible. what was god up to? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god's gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! was it possible i was being tested? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? that was very possible. all the same, why him? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts. i couldn't stop them.
i don't want you to die.
we'll miss you so.
we gotta think of something.
what did you say?
a photograph? what's the matter? hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "just a gigolo . . . "
how long has it been since you've been home.
the moon is almost gone!
call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. jane mckenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. i've been after it a long time.
you are to be executed at dawn anyway.  might as well commit the crime. go to her, wichita...
do you need a break?
wake up, cole.
darcy?
you're making me feel guilty again.
frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
yes.
fuck me.
yeah, hello. how are you?
what?
is this supposed to mean something to me?  what triangle?
oh, no-i mean, i'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. i don't-
do you think she might be interested in  someone?
it's obviously a frameup! they're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
all went well. nothing has happened. ceti alpha vi has checked out.
what sort of injury did he have?
i'm 0 for 16!  gimme some of that shit.
jesus.
oh, mr. gardiner, i've been looking all over.
he thinks he looks young.
who is that girl, anyway?
oh, come on! what are you talking about?
shoot him, nicky. not that we really mean it. but where does he live?
no -- we don't want this case in court.
kenny'll come running back. this is just his way of pressuring you.
if you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, i think i could win the nobel prize.
he's going to be a fireman.
it'll only take 20 minutes or so. you can pick it up at the window down the hall.
howdy pouty.
i didn't know i was asleep... what time is it?
where are you going?
mikey, i hoped...
"life is crushing in on me."
i can't take him to work.
do you?  when i saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? i'm not so sure if america is as far from england as i'd hoped.
then who are they?
fair enough for the shit.  but i think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
not unusual.
...i... everyone has been very kind to me.
i think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
don't care for cold steel?  a knife is worse than a bullet?
i said shut the fuck up --
y'all have a seat. is this all of you?
actually, i'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. so what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.
we did. it got lost in the shuffle.
who cried that one?
but your patient is legally entitled to it.
the capitol dome! lighted up!
yes, a fistula too small to show up on the x-rays.
you have to see her.
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
andy?... what? what is it?  andy... are you okay?
there's no disturbance.
vinkel...you've got quite a collection of er-collection.
how can you tell?
so she's honest.
is your name paul benjamin?
i can see that.  pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  what happened?
perfect! you wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
which is also why i've withheld this information from nato and our allies.
at last...
and why not?  he's a good lad -- bright and able.
caen?
why?
were you with him, when...
with mark?
how can you tell?
by yourself?
i'm a colonel.
you work here?
where the hell were you?
what are you doing here, assface?
no, sir.
lovebirds, i see.
sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, i ain't got it. i chased enough girls in my life. i went to enough dances. i got hurt enough. i don't wanna get hurt no more. i just called a girl just now, and i got a real brush-off, boy. i figured i was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. some stupid woman who i didn't even wanna call up. she gave me the brush. i don't wanna go to the stardust ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like i was a bug. i got feelings, you know. i had enough pain. no, thank you.
fuck logic!!
well, i'm just beginning to develop my theme. isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? okay, so they played on your insecurity. that's human, understandable. but, there is one guy who doesn't like little k as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, adolf. he thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, i want wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get wilhelm. so, josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna, i'll give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin. that's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. hard. why did you stay? why did you play for them? why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  jealousy?
listen, dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. i'll stay as long as you want.
i felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
hires you for what?
malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. i'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
did you see my present for you?
then focus on how you feel about her. because your feelings define you.   take off your gloves, michael.
no.
get on with it then.
because you got to figure it out for yourself.  are you listening to me?
jesus. listen, jill, tell you what. tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, i'll drive you down. i'll get off work or something.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  i'm gonna go now.
so what's the deal?
there’s a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story, you know.
i'm talking to you... i'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
the five hundred? sure.
mommy please help me!
just hold on!
shit! morehouse and sal are short. fu sheng's going on r&r, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. you got the fresh meat elias.
mr. travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
of course, you do get the good with the bad.  the new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  wave of the future, dude.  100% electronic.
i told you this was fuckin' dangerous. remember i said, 'ginger, this is a dangerous situation. be very careful.' you fuckin' yessed me to death.
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
no.  but i liked jesus' style.
tommy...!
but you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
hi.  lloyd dobler, sir.  pleasure to meet you.
thanks.
do they let you --
and bateman, what are you so fucking zany about?
why should they find out?  it's only two thousand dollars,  bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  you can do it. you're an accountant.  the word 'count' is part of your title.
everyone must leave the hotel now.
no! no! we are in the spell of the horn! hatred will destroy us.
can you?
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism. i wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. but as soon as i tried to do something about it, i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell.
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
yeah?
i couldn't make it in time.
oh. have a good day at school.
what the hell is this?
what're we talking about?  reach out for what?
how long you been coming here?
we're leaving, jason. we're leaving now.
we gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  the mau- mau's, we be scientists.  we drop science.
do you know how she found the apartment?
"dear diane, i'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, lloyd."  i've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.
no... no... the worst was when i went in for this after-school special and i'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. i see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
adam canfield. wonderful. do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? i don't even know who i'm talking to any more.
"lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. where are the lifeforms-"
unbelievable. some fag, no offense -
you don't?  well what's your favorite food then?
yeah. but who's not a slut these days?
no.
what do you want me to do?
yeah, why?
can!
least i'm not alone.
why did you do that?  didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  i worshipped you.  you inspired me.  i thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  i knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
he's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. you believe this?
that might have been good enough in rome last summer. but it's not good enough now.
did you now?  on which bounce?
i can't see anything in here!
leo strauss...  i've got to go to boston. i came to say goodbye.
anyway, thanks for helping me out.
their den?  have you ever seen anything like this?
i hear you talkin' clarence. we park our cars in the same garage.
who have you been talking to, jerry?  who else knows what you know?
yeah, i read your book. "mike" had the same problems as "chad" the stockbroker.
shocking, huh?
and fuck you.  fuck the lot of you. fuck you all.
please don't make this personal --
because this must be stopped.
he only lasted one season.
... gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american. but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... kinney, what did you come up with?
i love you very much, my dear.
he was a bit proud as i recall.
the other side got to him.
what gentleman, maria?
stop calling us. leave us alone. leave us alone. i'll kill you. i'll kill you.
i think that you do. do you know where i'm going?
when's it going down?
maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
good evening.  did you have a pleasant day today?
there's no number for frank in any of earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- i mean, like i said, he's dying, y'know.  dying of cancer.
...dad?
no...
for some sales pro...
yes. good luck, mister mcmurphy.
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
we've been talking it over, andy. your future that is... we feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
they can't convict us of that. you proved our innocence. besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
i'm setting up a timer.  when it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  but not before then, or you'll --
'atsa sign i got me an affectionate nature.
why?
peter finch -- he's english.
either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. basically you're fucked any way you go.
...see you tomorrow night.
i quit the movie.
for her majesty.
it was in the herald.
...look, they love you, kid – everybody does. you see caven's review in the herald?
you mean that's all you had me come out here for?
oh, nothing, it's fine. i just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
you think he really believed it?
you're coming back?
i burned it.  i tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
mussolini is raping sicily like every roman before him. so our brothers are coming to america. soldiers willing to fight and die. men who know the meaning of honor.
nothing -- ah -- detrimental, i hope.
don't know. maybe thursday.
my name isn't luke.  it's peter. peter appleton.
we are far from the hollow.  loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
oh!
i'm sorry.  it's not up to me.
congratulations, dad.
barbara <u>zelman</u>?  i don't believe this!
don't be ridiculous.
how many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
well, who can blame them, sir?
what does that mean?
come here.
a dull cliche.
what do you want to do now?
follow me - that way - through my cell -
...and, and, and did she...?  and she did the seven shows...
how's it feel?
no. not for money. but, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- i was pretty fucked up, you know.
you should have let me do the talking.
a statement?
kyle, you don't have...
trouble with your air-conditioning.
poor, yeah.
no. the little one.
because i'm planning on dying soon.
barnes?
so am i.
and you've a new wardrobe. he does want you to look attractive.  he tells me you're very beautiful.
and what sort of business will this be? if you don't mind my asking.
stop it.
thanks for not judging me.
thea -- you're hiding something. why do you suddenly speak of your father? you told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
he doesn't deserve this!  you don't know him.  it isn't fair!
now i remember why i went into theoretical work.  kent.
miss mitchell, do me a favor, will you? go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
that's what i thought.
maybe.  why?
he has to clean up.  how many bodies were there?
white's a mindless thug.
there's more! there's a couple stuck in there. i know there's more.
did you know him before you knew dad?
you have some marker, that's what i think, if you want to know the truth. you have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that janey can find them and then when i get back to the house i'll find the two of you in there and wendy'll be able to hear you and paul will be back and he'll hear you and i'll catch you, that's what i think. she'll be swearing and banging against the wall and i'll catch --
got any plants?
why do i always have to sit in back?
one hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
what are you smiling at?
all right. i'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
yeah, that's what i think.
probably.
you makin' any headway?
what do you mean?
why?
good-bye, brother!
keep what handy?
you use it justly, you're worthy of it.
need a hint?
what caused it?
don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
blow the goddamn hatch!
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that'd make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
which is?
if they put this creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
who was that?
we're going to look for him. want to come along?
you got the extender?
you just wait until i finish here. i've got to dust these ships for your dad.
who?
i have walked my way since the beginning of time. sometimes i give, sometimes i take. it is mine to know which, and when.
you're warren wayne.
so, bob, how long have you been in? st. k's?
man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
hi, it's me...
and you didn't send her to a doctor.
who'd believe it but you?  i took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  even if they find him, what connects him with me?
i'm not gonna throw you out, bernie.
i can't hear him.
yeah, right.
wow - i-
who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? i was trying to call for a half an hour.
i'm sorry i couldn't come pick you up honey.
you have one of these?
you always say that. you always say that. i'm telling you, you never met the man.
uh, scooby, now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all, like conan o'brien, but did you know even he went to college?
hi. you're here for the sex talk?
what kind of man *are* you?
please. i can't fight on an empty stomach. remember what napoleon said.
don't sneak up on me...
you see the look on that preppy puke's face?  fuckin' pissed in his topsiders.
don't wake the kids...
yes.  as soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  that's all there is.  until then, there is nothing.  you are nothing.
i guess skipper neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the academy, didn't he?
i guess.
legate narcissus meridas, general of the spanish felix legions!  i'm proud to have you in my school!  now, show them what you can do!
the leaves...
i can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  so <u>simple</u>.  say my name three times. that's all.  i'll be all yours. then i'll bring you over here in style.
wait!  wait!  there's something i forgot to tell you.
i wanna go...just let me go...
victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
listen...don't you worry about ed. he'll come around.  he's too good a sheriff to let you give him the slip.
what caused it?
i'm following you and david, if you-
it isn't always this rough?
hello?
i'll call tomorrow.
the fog, terror train, prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies?
i don't wanna talk about it.
are you asking me?
no what?
shut up. it's daddy, shit-head.
we got to get movin'.
still no response, sir.
...yes, thank you.
the dolphin was a symptom.
we miss you.
yes, sir.  but what about the disks?  if the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
what about you?
do you know that?
you were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  together?
i'm ready.

what do you think?
good night, daphne.
a man helped me open it...
she your only sibling?
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, rolfe, and some night i'm going to bite back. i swear it.
i don't know what you're referring to, but i do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
fine. what's, uh, what's on your mind?
kay-em!
you watch this garbage?
now what?
we got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
yes. yes, they were partners.
so, this is leto the just...
stupid woman... and that's all?
you?  you think you're the only one?  i've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
yes.
we've got nothing to talk about
you know, i saw your father this week about his sinus...
<u>no</u>.  no, that was too easy -- 
how did you know your son was involved?
i am king, d'artagnan.  i will change my mind as i wish, and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish!
tough work, that.
i did?
various enterprises, style of thing.
good-night, cin. i'll be next door if you need me.
that's where we're going.
what are we going to do?
mr. bond! nice to see you.
d00-lang, doo-lang, d00-lang.
that's unkind.
well, stay here tonight.
what.
all flayed...?
charming, isn't she?
holy fucking shit!
i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
what happened? he ain't dead? what's goin' on?
because it's there.
a little precaution, sir. i've had traps set for me before now. there are people in central services who'd love to get their hands on harry tuttle.
the dante hicks dinner and a movie date. i think i've been on that one before.
not yet...how much further is it?
that's right.
the cells in our bodies are always changing. in six or seven years all your cells have changed. you could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
what ya want?
she's the organizer's, wife. she's got to be there.
no.  jacques is a creature of the sea.  he isn't meant to live on earth, among us... you should know this, johana.
asteroids!  chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
is there anything you do?
sure i know maya.
she was talented, but honey i wish i could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, i proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
apparently, drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything?
came from redfoot.
yeah.  real hot.
i mean, most of the time jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'me-tarzan'ish, you know what i mean?  lately it bugs me, i guess.  merrick?  are you still breathing?
i'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
i'm getting treatments right here.
are you here?
the goddamn sign on the wall. i can't do unauthorized work?  what am i suppose to do? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they gonna blame then?  they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
i thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
it's the last place they'd look.
i made it.
mary, come on...
no, but... he sent me so many signs!
every russian family has one..
it's just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. and, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great -- i mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i don't know, maybe i'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
what was that?
they don't have to be dull. i mean if you and me put our minds together...
there's a lot of carbon scoring here. it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
was anyone in my room today?
it is pankot palace that kills my village.
yes. i took refuge in the barn. wouldn't you? lost in the storm? freezing and wet? i was exhausted and could search no longer.
there's a satellite call for you.
well, about six months ago -- i was going to night school, taking this course in advanced accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so i gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing i knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
that's what i'm saying.
--whatever you want, no problem--
i get all your cds.
are you sure?
nobody there to sign for it, mon.  what's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
we are talking...

ouch!
no. but i have a hangover.
why are they singing, mama?

i've waited my whole life for this job, but i don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  do you know why?
is the trial date set?
no, i tell you! nobody knows where he got it.
how?
where did he go?  he was just here.
yeah? the sport utility?
all right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
mr. gittes...  don't tell me how i feel.
about what?
i saw my lawyer this morning -- i wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information i was after. you see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
alright, cool.  i gotta hit the showers, but...i think this'll be really good.
can it be that easy?
chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
it doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
there were three strawberries.
got him in the foxhall.  4421 gainsborough.
were you looking? about the statue of liberty?
yeah.
ramón ... listen for the love of god ...
you can't duck this, bill. i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen.
i didn't know you were coming.
jennifer, there is more to life than work.
i better not come in.
did he say why?
which one was logjammin'?
very strange.
... when you dive... with that machine... what does it feel like?
well he asked me for it!
kathy costello.  that's my maiden name.
well. well, what i mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. but look this, brother, it is even more interesting. look at this mark here, and that mark over there. now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
in love?  i'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  i'll tell you what i love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
are you going with chet?
nero.

not even a radio?
uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
mom, i mean dad...
there, okay? now that's just plain old hamburger.
yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
what did you say?
how can he be playing chess with you? you're not making any moves against him.
you're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
yeah.  how are you?
that's hotel life. in one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
then how do you know about --
can i help pump the gas?
mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
jesus! ain't that a load off! you live in 605?
you!  i remember you!
don't fret. it's only his dream. dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
he lost it on the way up.
i - i...  i can't, michael.  there's stuff --- at the clinic -
what about you ?
you wouldn't even try  there must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
he didn't do it!
you took your boots off? you put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  you fuck me up over there, i'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! you understand?  go over there and apologize.  go! get the fuck out of -
ha ha... yes. with prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... as we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
could you believe those girls!
maybe i'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. in south africa the numbers were small...
there's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  are they all shark victims?
i've got a responsibility here. i can't let everybody grab free drinks.
honey, i don't think this is really relevant to...
downtown?  fine.  get a hold of santino, i'd be more than glad to talk to him.
you ever think about running away?
a ring for my wife. a lot like that one. in fact, it was that one.
can we go fly over central park?
is this 509-9027?
yeah. well, i do.
yes, wade, i mean twombley. put out that cigarette. fuck. fuck. fuck.
i saw the blood. it looks like motor oil.
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant?
how can i give you this statement?
you were, sir galahad, you were in terrible peril.
why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
you feeling any better?
the fish saved my life.  two years ago, i found out i had high blood pressure.  so my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out.
shit.
my face tell you all that?
they'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in brookhaven.  usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
navy transmission.  they're sent from wisconsin.
i don't think you understand.
since i was a child, i’ve always had a power over men. when i realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, i knew i had to form a new alliance.
esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
i can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. turn around.
peters. we need to know what happened to the crew. before it happens to us.
it's another demonstration against the king.  this is the wildest yet.
what's wrong with him?
but he's ok. if he wasn't ok, he wouldn't be here. okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. but once again, at the risk of being redundant, if i even think i hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. okay, quickly.  mr. brown, mr. white, mr. blonde, mr. blue, mr. orange, and mr. pink.
you let him get away!
don't even.  you're not going to show me that tired map.
really?
i'm getting --- left behind.
you have to understand. when i was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. and i started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. with another house, another family. he leaves us, he goes to them. or maybe there is no family. maybe he never wanted a family. but whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
i can sea its breath in the cold.
this fork is filthy.
nice!
notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
what the hell do you want? mary tyler moore?
i don't like this, this...
i'm sorry. i've had you on your feet for hours.
thanks, walter.
intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
you know what a phone booth is?!
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
we're waiting on you.
stop!
billie.  you ready?
air force one, this is af-135-ra. we have been instructed to refuel your plane.
six months, i'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
but what about the noise from the car. what if --
you stole a trans-am.
look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  but if you want my advice, you'll send billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  just until you get yourself straightened out.
ho-ly shit.
donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  are you clean?
eyowch! this is one hot pizza!
you have.
sir, may i go first??
what's the matter with you! gettin' yellow?
oh, yeah.  i didn't really know my dad...
alone. all alone.  oh, you strange -- strange creature.
they think i offed the director.
what kind of project?
well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  i'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
you know, jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
he doesn't know when to give in. they'll kill him.
can i ask you something?
sorry to bother you, bud.
damn that charlie i
okay.
we walked the place for a week.
insubordination.  to the emperor... and the senate.
just when do you start, telling people?
there's nothing to tell.
you didn't cook breakfast?
on the world i come from there's no light. no sun. beauty isn't important. i see now there's a world elsewhere.
it was just a fishing expedition. apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc.
it's still better than letting somebody find him.
that's why you're having them. your spells.
last time i saw you was someplace very gay.  i remember waving to you. i was dancing on a table.
don't you want to get out?
do it!  put me out of my misery so i don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  you think it's so easy?
basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! what are you doing?
that's the point, isn't it?
excuse me sir.
i'm sorry. we don't.
why didn't you call for back-up! what were you thinking, jesus!!!
what's happening?
what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if i'm only gettin' bank interest, i'd look for complete security. heck, fdic. i don't see nothin' like that here.
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. i guess i deserved it. i've been thinking about my three year plan and i think it's unworkable. i must have been delirious.
pension him off.
leave your sister out of it.
well, are we still on for tonight?
gee. but --
he says if i want to get back to work, no problem.  he wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
what. you're what? you're with this creep now.
why do i have to do this?
this is a convent, not a clinic.  we offer moral guidance, not hardware.
i was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. and then throw him in the can.
there is nothing to discuss.
c'mon.
i'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. maybe more.
any day now.
... babies.
you know, i was the one who created hell.
nothing. still nothing.
he looks strange, doesn't he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
where does dickie live?
shut up, kevin.
hide your laptop here.
you look like mush mouth from fat albert.
slowed things down?  where have i been?  have we been going fast!?
hey, man.
yeah.  right.  how were you supposed to know? fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  colt, browning, smith, thompson, kalashnikov... all men.  men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  you're so creative.  you don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  to feel it growing inside you.  all you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
territoriality. he was mine first.
this is tom ripley. freddie miles.
no.
who do you suppose they were? and where did they take her? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
uh-huh...
that's good
absolutely. the world is my oyster.  whatever that means. 
no, i'm gonna quit!
dean's with lyle.
uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
yes. he called some of the biggest people in town.
bring back some memories, nick?
you want my advice?
how'd you know my name was jack?
i know we can. it's real simple. we go into a room, grab some car keys and --
wait, no!  do not be ashamed.  the straits of your family need not be permanent.  it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
he'll love it.
you know what, by god?
maybe they'll leave now.  that snake was a pretty nasty customer.
i think mary agnes could kill someone.
no.  no don't feel like clarence thomas.
admiral, i don't understand. the enterprise --
this is the home of an angel.
plato?
we got a mistrial, you know. joe -- did you hear what i said...?
too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! nobody gets into mother's draws except daddy!
he asked to go home early.  he said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
no, it's me.
first of all, i have been feeling much better lately. i don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you.
why certainly!
oh, i didn't know that.
couldn't have said it better myself.
the telephone calls... we know about that.
and i'll never do it again. forgive me?
hold me, don.
begging?  groveling?  any pathetic behavior at all?  will that help? faith's there tonight, and i've got to talk to her.
he'll wear a wire?
okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  you come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. you go to tobacco... tobacco is a sales culture. market and sell enormous volume. go to a lot of golf tournaments. the hell with everything else.  what are you doing? why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
what about you?  what's in this for you, eugene?
me.
you truly want to do something to make me happy?
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
is that what you wanted to ask me?
are you mad?
did you like my friend frankie?
when i see you. pick me up at sam's. you count the money?
only up there in the dream they called life.
i have to go.  i'm on call for overflow down at the hub.
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
do i have to raise me voice?
don't flee from yourself.  if you have a quality, let it define you.  cultivate it.  it is you.  by helping me, you will help yourse...
no thanks.
then listen closely, because i'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, i'll deny it.  i run call girls.  lynn bracken is one of them and so was susan lefferts. i treat my girls very well.  i have grown daughters, myself, and i don't like the thought of women being hurt.  i sense you share this feeling.
then you have everything.  you can put them away.
i'm talking to you asshole !
they said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
no, mr. lowery... but then she's always a bit late on monday mornings.
nothing. it's just you're a girl after my own heart.
leave him alone, ma--al's just billy- goatin' around--
no, that's not what i'm saying. i'm saying i don't need a limousine to know who i am, alright?
why?  what's wrong?
oh.  do you have any pictures?
i love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn't even tell myself?
-- you seem amused.
if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.
hello.
they scare people off because most people lack vision. vision and balls. present company excluded of course.
i do.
i don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
he's setting that play to music?
do you have a girlfriend?
the keys?
all i ate was fish.  that's solid protein.
oh my god.
but where are we going, mr. crandall?
set 'em up again... c'mon, set 'em up again.
would you like me to take my pants off?
nobody wants to hurt you peaches!
remember me?
what'd he say?
heather chandler is more popular than ever now.
carla?... it's me, danny...danny balint...? we met at that...[meeting at your house.]
what about matt ?
she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims, i might add.

m'm, i don't know, sometimes i ask myself how i'd stand up under torture.
whatcha boys playin'?
bullets.
looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
i don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
no, this hurts.
the ginger i knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
norman?  where's norman?
i see.  and now you catch ghosts?
i get it.
yuri... are you...
oh, yah, i know that!
8,000.  we can't raise more... we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
just you.
i'm sorry we got you into this, tommy.
i didn't.
okay, i'll take it all.
cute thing.
your --
"deserve" don't mean shit, little bill.
just, i need results.  and -- i am short-handed.  who else am i gonna give him?
what's his real name?
but we're not open on sundays.
his eyes are open.
faith...?
i got it.
and, and, and, i did it.  and i put a kid through school. she...and...cold calling, fella. door to door.  but you don't know. you don't know.  you never heard of a streak.  you never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." what are you, you're a secretary, john.  fuck you.  that's my message for you.  fuck you and kiss my ass. you don't like it, i'll go talk to jerry graff.  period.  fuck you. put me on the board.  and i want three worthwhile leads today and i don't want any bullshit about them and i want 'em close together 'cause i'm going to hit them all today.  that's all i have to say to you.
trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
...anything else?
don't talk to them anymore.  sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to algeria - i'll write you from there.
you never said this lednov's name before, that i can remember.
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
you wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
my father wants me in new york. he builds boats. i'd rather sail them. i travel under my mother's name.
carrying swayzak's notebook?
round up who you can and put them on standby.
no, i just promised myself i'd give it a try. i gotta get out there sooner or later.
yo ho ho!
what tables?  i've never seen him before.
don't let it pull you deeper!
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr, esdras...
do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains?
listen, we're suppose to sing on tv day after tomorrow. at the park...
take it up!
nah, gave her the heisman.  i'm working on something new.
you've got something to show me.
happy birthday.
they made me put my hat back on.
what have you come up with on the riddle?
excuse me, father, mother, when are we moving back to tokyo? i can't stand this place anymore. they put butter on everything.
well, that's about to change big time.
why?
well?
i wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, terry?
thank you.
feels awful good. yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
none of your damn business.
no.
don't be so optomistic, harry.
for the last time.  i may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, i treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
can't focus...
why the hell you wanna go up to nu mung ba for?
i'll take you home, angela.  why don't you leave those with us for a while?
no --
translation: a total geek.
disgusting?  bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  they raised enough money to build a day care center.
oh.
it's a regular college. it's just run by the nuns. the sisters of st. anne.
how did you get over it? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  not this lane. not today.
what, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  how dumb you gotta be? that's exactly what they --
then you tell me, what just happened?
what's new?
that's what you said in turley. you remember how that ended.
he only had a hundred an' thirty. -- i think he's good for the rest next week, mr. gazzo.
i'm sorry if it gets noisy --
i'm looking at you -- you murderer!
a man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
why?
what would your mother say to that?
anything else? 
you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
i don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  i must be going crazy...
let's go.
how did they get away?
did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
i talked with your father last night.
oh, let me see - way back in 1713, i think it was, that father perrault stumbled into the valley, half frozen to death. it was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
no. this is a set up.
what is going on...?!
you fucked me, man? why would you do that?
but -- you have to go out there! i'll give you more than your one third!  when i get paid... just take the fall!  you're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
"big brother", "little brother"?
did you expect him to look you up?
imagine--she was alive. what a horror. could have been buried alive. she must have run away from the morgue.
that's your proof?
well, i changed the ending a little.
yeah. like that.
maxine...
see 'em?  they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. broke my windshield...
if i did, i'd have kept my mouth shut...  it fits, paul... fifty-five gallons of p2p confiscated four years ago... guess who was in on the collar? mac.  he salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. but they do now.  and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
where'd he ever see us?
well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
i don't understand.  where is she?
mr. harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
so it seems sergeant.
you're going to be over the limit.
so have i.  but i've never been in love.  isn't that awful?
but nothing... i'm mad as hell. this is a terrible thing you've done.
jesus, open your eyes! seagrave, cosgrove, and now holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
then there is another jungle?
is this disease common in the tropics?
try harder.
[i don't know him. i saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
no! what's going on? where's my family?
no.
excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? what was the instant of purity? the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
what, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
how would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
they tortured us.  and you're going to let them have all that money?
won't your father help you with that?
you should come back with me to steven's house.
over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. i loan a little money out, settle some arguments. got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. there's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the mexicans hire each other. there's the holiness church and there's big o's place.
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs. windham?
good night, mike.
where did you get that?
there are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long i've worked for the mob. the <u>mob</u>, bobby!
thank god.
party without me.
i think we can cut your visit short. leon is not here.
it has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
what is it?
uncommon, too.
and don't be walking off with any of that. you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
except yours-yours.  the goal of world domination.  well, if you put it that way, minnie.  how can i resist?
no! no!
be careful.
i just told you. she called me.
he hates oliver stone.
you've seen the post-its.  i've already got more juicy material than i need. why should i pay you dollar one?
slow.
never mind.  wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  that'll muffle the signal.
good god, ya'll!
it won't run a week!
no.
this whole place is ticking.  does it -- keep time?
go out to mount vernon. it'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see washington's home just before walking into the senate for the first time-- don't you think?
good god... they're meat eaters, roy, just drop the shit in there!
allow me some time.  i have spent every hour in the company of others. i need to be alone.
jeffrey--
i need to see you, ballard. i need to talk to you about the project.
more endearments.
it's isolated.
before the coma!
zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
i don't want to start no fight with you, buddy. why do you say i'm full of shit?
yes, but what sort of a man?
i already know you think you're worthless.  i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  i haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
we buried them, then we went to track.  it was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  we went faster. we caught up to them at kentucky ford.
fuck! fuck you fucking guys!
<u>never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. use your words.
did you tell me rachel took the kids back to chicago for a few days?
that's too bad. i got a half million shares. my whole foundation! and now look at me!
aw--give a feller a break. my cards are on the table-- i want to know you. how about dining with me tonight?
i swear! i didn't tell her nothing! you probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
yes, i understand.  i'm listening.
what?
here comes the fbi.  you men lookin' for protection?  we got all the police right here.
see threepio... do you copy?
you're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. weather's turning very nasty -- and so am i.
somebody say somethin'?
what can you say?
unless you want the right.
what are you talking about?
what do you want?
the "old man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
yeah, i'm a nurse's aide at mercy.
no.
we're not supposed to go back there.
you know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
i'm worried.
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
i imagine that's very important. especially during the moulting season.
-- but he does seem very nice.
who is it?
daddy is coming for us.
why does he call you 'master'?
it's not that it's hard.  i just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
so?
doctor lady make it irey.
get your clothes off.
she was afraid.
we can't do this alone.  we've got to get help.
we got a mistrial, you know.  joe -- did you hear what i said...?
hey... cy... what now you a righteous panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
you doin' the hirin'?
nothing for me. i'm leavin'.
fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
okay. that's good. i just wanted to make sure.
crossed over?
joe...  joe...
now that makes sense. we'll hang out for a couple of days. get a little r&r. make sure future man's ok and then get back on the road.
then we're all in on it?
scooter, did i tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
how 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  the guy is seriously not well.
oh, we're good man.
i'm leaving the house around midnight.  in case you're going to follow me.  i'm going down to johnny's club.
who had to put a gun to your head?
my visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
i don't know. one of these days, i'm gonna see louis. my back's killing me.
i've met you before.
i know who you are, mr. ames.
it is called: mantan - the new millennium minstrel show.
she's no vampire.
well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. but it was pretty obvious what she was doing. i mean, christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
your brother was up here the other day. he said you ran away from home.
so far, you have four and i only have two!
try the spicy tuna hand roll.
what do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
pdt's.  personal-data transmitters. every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
well, excuse me for askin', milt, but isn't it kinda dead in here?
i'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
this is where i get off.
gin's okay.
something like that.
well, id'n that nice.
hey there, nickie.
i've got just the job for you -- secretary of war.
a monkey?
how can you say that?  especially after today?
so, scott, why don't we start with you. why are you here?
i hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
where's the john?  let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
it's him! the first sandman. he killed... doc.
how is that helping, natalie? how exactly?
i don't want it now.
funny how things turn out, isn't it?
who said "fuck the machine"?
did you fish in messina? the "pesce spada"?
we're goosed! goosed by god!
oh, i'll be there all right.  i'm not letting you out of my sight. not till you're ready.
what are you doing?
she asked for it.
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle... quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
ezal!  ezal!
promise?
but you, you've had them.
how does that help me?
it's "comptoir sud pacific." makes me feel like a hula girl. which is kinda what i'm going for. wanna come in?
hey, do you know something? she supports a mother and two kids. what do you know about that?
all right- you'll spend your nights inside.  you'll have plenty of ammunition. you're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
we still have to get out of here.
i hate loving her.  i hate the kind of her person she is.  i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  i hate letting her use me. but i love her too much to do otherwise.  and i certainly love her too much to kill her.  i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  but you?  you got the killing in you, boy.
listen to me son. you got to swear. swear means promise. first swear you'll take care of little pearl. guard her with your life, boy. then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. not even your mom.
the probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. on three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  it cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! what's the matter with you!  didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
no, not again.
no. you lost your way.
yeah.
jeez, louise, that wasn't very nice.
you're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. i said i'd tell you everything i know. you and your friends behind the mirror.
he is a bolshevik. he will have us at war by the end of the year. i think i'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
it's a three-act story with a tragic end.
listen. i got a lot of respect for her, sir.  that's about as good a one as i know to tell you.
hello, hildy. i thought you were gone.
ask the chinese mission to leave our country. immediately.
am i a member of this club?
i want to see brad.
half a million for you.  half a million for me.  one-point-three five for the colombians.
i can't take this.
i'm going on staff at the n.s.f.  to work for drumlin.
i'm leaving. i'm getting out.
do you mind if i borrow it?
and now, drum roll please...
do i look crazy?
sissy clark, 190 riverside dr., apartment 3c.  tomorrow.  she's a nursing student.  paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the peppermint lounge, on west 63rd.  left work at two a m...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
yes.
would you like me to turn the lights out?  or would you like them on?
his name is jared nomak.
you think darcy is gonna be at nasa tonight?
and how are we today?
i'm serious! i'm just so sick of everybody! why can't i just do whatever i want?
the man has taken over my mind. he's not only out there. he's in my head and i can't get rid of him. i can't write a word without imagining his response. i'm paralyzed as an artist.
what's wrong?
an austrian.
you're wall to wall and tree top tall.
so what makes you think he'll play for us?
what?
"nocturnal.  external hair and bony plates.  locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "external mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "morphological characteristics: highly robust.  aggressiveness: extreme."
unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
hello, jean-pierre.
we don't want to be any trouble.
what are you going to do?
no -- that's for me to do.
we're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, i mean ms. heller. maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
you can't win 'em all.
that's a light down there --
"purple skinned monstrosity...?"
i'll get the dress.
tell me about yourself.
i got us through the war all right.
you didn't have to get into it, baby.
you could put it that way.
n-no. he... he beat him up. he was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... ned just died.  little bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
i only met him once, but that was enough.  for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  he offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  he claims to have some sort of factory in texas, i believe. said i could have the run of the place.  he had all sorts of specifications.  but when i questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  it's sad.  so few men do.
captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
it's changing characteristics.  it's solidifying taking on weight.
care for a smoke?
is that so bad?
to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday. but sir -
that's the good stuff.
no, i'm actually writing for the pictures now –
uh huh?
but i see them.
you're not going to take your *suit* off!
how do you know?
i can't believe you didn't notice. my weight.  i lost ten pounds in rome
it ain't worth it, jake. get out.
and what's it like?
did they hurtcha?
i know a couple of addicts. stupid wee lassies. i feed them what they need. a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. it's easy money for me. not exactly a fortune, but i'm thinking, 'i should be coining it here.'  less whores, more skag. swanney's right. get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. what do you think?
betty.
sara, my arm. i'm stuck, honey.
jts...?
he must be on his way to pee out a fire.
what? oh, edward. hi. congratulations. great party-
thanks for nothing! i hate snakes!
i asked him not to tell me where he was going.  i told him i don't want any part of it.
rather astonishingly so, yes. and particularly so in the case of father perrault himself. do you know when he and the natives were finished building shangri-la, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
other way around, sir.
so young, so unlined, so full of promise.  so innocent.
thank you. thank you so much.
did you see his hair color?
take it easy now. don't rush it.
my brother.  he fell out of the old beech tree.  broke his neck.  i was on a camp out.  they started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  they didn't find him 'till the next morning.  they didn't even know why he was up there.
seconds and thirds, too.
i don't know, just a fin. over there. about a hundred meters.
i hate outside! i hate it!
or are you too scared?
i never bought that.
that's a lie!
yeah.  nice.
dad's fixin' something again.  hit the deck!
what?
oh thomas, a pair of pippins! as round and rare as golden apples!
he's cooked! they'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as i'm--! and now they're all down on him. yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. boloney! it's the frame of all time! when i see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- i wanna *fight*!  look, kid--rack your brains, will you? haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? i'll write my arm off--i'll blow taylor and his--
the premiere was the first time i've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
dr. winkel? who is he?
what's it like?
not if i can help it. you got any information for me?
not for a long time, now.
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  it put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  we laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  when a bird called, we answered back. every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  we had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  i sang "oh promise me." can you imagine? where the hell did i ever learn the words to "oh promise me"?  looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b-36.  all the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  never stopped drinking blue soup.  blue soup all the time. we'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
everything. it is a ghastly existence.
just step from the car.  nice and slow.
i don't want him.
and after the steak... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall?
i think she's lying.
and did you?
jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
as a matter of fact, i was just trying to decide the color of anne's eyes. i can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. what would you say, mrs. schuyler?
what can i do for you folks?
he'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
it all seemed to make sense until box.
not fooling around.
okay. 
well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
why don't you answer the man, sidalee?  he's trying to take you off the hook.
i'm fine. i have to get going to my friends' house.  was it --
you can't kill mulder. he's got too much light on him.
believe me, man; fred'll be no problem.
yo' tommy, what up, man?
projecting joy is not my job.
aqui! venga por aqui! [over here! come this way!]
admiral, i am receiving whale songs.
hey. watch the mouth. watch it.
a week ago, at most.
at this moment, i feel no love for you at all.  i never thought that could happen, but it has.
nudie booth?
yeah, that's stens.
it wasn't just you, bunny.
hey -- what about dorothy?
you've got to go to sleep now.
i shall. from your knowledge of mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
nothing on my scanner, sir.
i can't ask her again -- nathan, stop it! jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- i feel terrible, hon.
alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? not only that, you look thin and tired.
where did it come from, mama?
'cause you're too little.
... you know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  i can handle it.   but don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
i just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
they're gonna be what?
yeah.
give up, mark, it's hopeless.
correct the actual list is safe at langley.  "golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
twenty-one.  the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  the horror pictures were trifles.  grand guignol for the masses.
i have.  that's why i didn't call you first.
machine.
makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
and?
but he's interested!
hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
so beautiful, irena. so beautiful.
don't you like bodega bay?
assault with a deadly weapon.
you're not.
c'mon, larry. be good for you.
book.  sunglasses.  great.
come on, dignan.
mr. mitchell stephens, esquire, would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now?  beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  because that's what i'm about to do.
if he can do it, yes.
why are you doing all this, what for?
stop!
ah - - they're here.
i beg your pardon?
...now, let me get this straight. two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
it's nothing. i burnt myself.
that girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
it could be parasites, an infection...
are you going to keep him, sir?
i don't mean that! why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! ain't never gonna make you happy! never made warin' happy.
i'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
i'm having luck for the first time in my life.
alex, i don't have the time --
if he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
you'd better get a new alarm clock. the chief has been hollering for you.
what were _you_ looking for?
sorry, pal.  entrance is for residents and guests only...
he doesn't have one.
oh, sid, you’re sounding desparate. i guess fearing death makes one anxious.
what's happening?
and he was missing an arm.
that much magic i can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
what?
jesus christ!
don't worry, mom. i know.
we got a call from berkeley p.d. there was a killing.  a professor. icepick.  in his bed.  multiple stab wounds.  1977.
where to?  south america?  oh. that is unexpected.
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that's what i would've done.
dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
have you told gretchen about the spears?
because i have to!
miss bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or i'll have you and patchett in shit up to your ears.
you don't need a drink.
sure...
what?
i tagged the goddamned stocking. it ain't lost.  we're sequestering that evidence.  that's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
uh huh. so pee.
you think he's too old for me?
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
not unless you hear my confession.
uh-huh.  what can be?
protection?
oh, dear -- i keep forgetting i'm not in kansas.
you... you are alive.
for bringing you here. come on, tell!
told you the snow was coming down. take the grader.
incidentally i mention only in passing that i could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
sid, cut the crap.  i --
they always call the great ones nuts.
this part isn't about the virus, is it?
how is that wally doing?
i don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
all you do is profit from another man's misery!
there's nothing in it!
ask me to meet you again, jimmy.
so where are all your toys?
are you out of your fucking mind? we're going to die.
anything else?
it's me!
hello there. how’s the flat. i cleaned...
it's like the last time. he sent me a present before he --
it's done. a truce. we meet at the river.
proof.  proof of a unified field. not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
it could have been anything, marty.
yeah. but i thought she died.
ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. put on some clothes, rose, you're naked as a jay bird. when you're dressed, come on downstairs. i'm afraid your friend billy is injured, where are his clothes?
alright, let's check it out.
some people.
may i speak with you?  alone?
doesn't he live here?
this is too fast.  this is <u>way</u> too fast!
hiya, pardner.  long time no see.
well, you know, not all algerians speak french. it's a matter of what school you went too. me i never really --
well -- did you get it, thorwald?
now what happens?
if that's what you think is necessary.
let me remind you who is the new race. and who is the old.  what could be gained by withholding anything from them; by pretending to ignorance? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. to start colonization early.
...eliminated one.  swat's on the next two...
yes.
i spent all evening on the mainframe. lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. no record of anyone named mofet. but "split city" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. i tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  it's a mini-storage facility outside baltimore, where lecter had his practice.
wear the belly before you go.
what do you want me to do, johnny?
and why is that? has something happened?
i know it starts with a birth certificate...
i want you to come with me.
tell me, miss saunders--what time does the senate--uh--what do they call it?
why didn't you wait for me?
how many of you are there?
i'm looking for love
well, that's news to me. the name's tom.
want to hear my favorite aria?
what's wrong can never be made right. 
we'll see.
i'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
don't sweat it, man. i needed a kick in the ass. we're better friends for it.
be a swimmer.
what?
two maze runners.
cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
whattaya mean?
i'm a homicide detective.  where were you last night?
yeah, i can see that. he's fuckin nuts --
you're not looking for the statue of liberty at all.
there's a guy here on the task force right now.  maybe i should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
it may not be that simple. this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
yes.  whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant.  when the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  the killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
jimmy, how's the -
but she's your *daughter*...
no whistles, but a club you bring a hack -- ?
what do you think it is?
keep a good eye on him. he's makin' a lot of money for us. and he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
don't call the vice president!
say, you're always razzing everything i do, but this is one time i'm in.
that's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
can't you talk to him? maybe talk him into it. i'm a real good interviewer. just get me in the room with him.
how many times have i fired her?
look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and i did and i started to like her, and then i realized i just couldn't in good conscience do it.
thank you for coming.  would you care for a drink?
i would not for the world!
indy, look!
god, i am starving, but i can't eat this...
i'm lucky i have an after-school job where i can practice my talent.
look, you're a player... i'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
gotta go.
you earned it.
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome... we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
i almost didn't make it to the bathroom, miguel. i almost lost control right in front of everybody.
never.
where are you, anyway?
how ingenious! tell me about them.
to pit your own life against another.
find me something, i don't care where it is.
`methodology and techniques of anesthesiology.'  yes.
go where?
please, don't do that...
my god.
what's the matter?
her favorite uncle
i'm going ashore to take a look around the island. there are some ruins up there...
sally, for christ's sake.
just over a year.
these scars.  how did you get them?
you use your equipment, don't you?
all the data banks in artoo are still secure.
where will my toys be?
the telephone is ringing.
nell... please, nell... take a deep breath...
when you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? who did you call?
it doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
that's anthony.
she's ... well, she's good.
it's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
i just can't deal with all this crap between us, i'm sorry.  i'm quitting.
if there ever was a devil in this county, ike, you is it!
i wish to... go back to the way i was.
the three unions. it's 43% of bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value g.g., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since texas air...
i'm so glad you could come, mr.--
yes?
me too. there's this poem --
i am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  these are <u>my</u> children.  they don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
nine minutes!
sure...
and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
what do you take me for?
i have the stuff from last year's...
thanks.
colwyn.
what?!  what that mean?
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he's wild about.  want to come?
carlo!
not a problem unless you're gonna make --
not just any mike & ike's -- cherry mike & ike's.  do you know why i, viktor taransky, two-time academy award nominated director --
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
all in yellow?  oh!  that was my father!
you're in league with barbossa!
excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
yesterday.  we got the network feed from gateway; it was the top story on 'sixty seconds'.  biggest market crash since twenty-four.
is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
totally. the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven.
monsieur félix -- ?
what is this, mozart? what's the matter with you?
okay... you tell me why --  "you're dying here."
like what?
i can see nothing's changed.
see that, son? now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. someone has been walking here.
how about you? do you want to go?
do you think i'm pretty?
1976.  what happened back then?
your parents are divorced?
price didn't make the guest list... the house did. it wants vengeance.
no, actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? people get all hung up on details, but what's the point? like which school? does it matter? why? when? where? or how many o grades did i get? could be six, could be one, but that's not important. what's important is that i am, right? that i am.
what time is it?
eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time?
but why didn't he just follow her to fiji?
where is pancakes hause?
nurse! nurse!
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
it's still a good plan.  it's just... got a twist.
dogshit. worse yet, they don't care.
hilarious. no, i just keep all of my old comics down here, and i want to show you one of them.
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type.
uh huh, i wanna be a writer.
what are you? new? let me tell you how good this guy is. last night, al calls this bookie to settle up. apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. so the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? what does al do? does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond? does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? no... he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole-type... how he fleeced.
were you fooling with the power?
beat it.
i really think i can be of service on this one.
she was going to throw it out, wasn't she? just toss it like a scrap of wood.
stop saying that, it's bullshit.
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you.
you're not from beyond the valley.
entertaining.
you a fine lookin' woman, jackie. i bet you do a damn sight better than okay. you think anybody followed you?
it floated back up.  i had to take him out and --
or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  i really like that.  let the other girls have the guys like you. chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  i find you all so boring.
shoot no, not after all these years.
you're a sick man, you know that?
you'd love to prove that. getting your name in the national geographic.
throw it.
yes!
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
that's a good one.
the play's going to be really good.
no, no, no. you were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. it won't do. it's stupid and boring.
didn't want to miss anything.
yes. haven't you thought about it at all? seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
any particular reason?
hi. this is nikki. leaves a message. 
i don't know? maybe i'd like it. i'm trying to change here. you could be supportive.
do you think francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
we've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  i wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  still miss your mother?
now he's here. he went in mr. grant.
what for?
i hadn't noticed.  i've seen you around.  what's your name?

are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
i'll know soon enough.
schaefer, i gotta see this welles picture
you know, you're a very attractive girl.
yes, i'm well aware of that. but this case is quite exceptional.
what? are you kidding me? who sent you here?
like you'd get if it was hand held.
oh, nothin'. i never let on to mama about dell bein' the one. i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? i didn't tell dell, neither. he was back home in chattanooga by then, anyhow, and i didn't see the point. somethin' terrible happened to him, though. six months ago.
what are you saying?
did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
there never was, there'll never be another like you.
he wants a reconciliation.
klute, tell me, what's your bag? are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? or --

what's wrong, ellen?
you died, man.  i can't believe it but here you are.  last year, you and your girlfriend --
congress, the fbi, red channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "they" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  now, did you go to any meetings?
use the little brush there.  why were you at santos'?
why don't you try?
you have beautiful eyes.
...you betcha. s'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
you're just gonna walk?
i mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
who cares!
i'm sure you do, mr. deveroux.
yes, i've seen you in something. that one about a king.
just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
it should be here any minute.
can you make out any pattern in all that?
she's dead?
"the show must go on."
...worst possible time for me.
i don't know.  i may be in love with him.
from my father.  he was the tribe's shaman.
maybe we should just...
you were in the car!
i've got ... one last number for you, theo ...
-- i do not accept excuses.  i'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
with what?
now it's okay?
annie's there. she'll be all right.
could i ask some questions?
but dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
that's a good thing?
he claims?  powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? or some kind of nut case who --
i'm not lettin' no one go.
hi again, how's it going?
what have you been doing here!  <u>huh</u>! <u>i wanna know</u>!  <u>what have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
i been bad!
you don't know him very well, do you?
what's the difference?
yes sir. i do, sir.
i was an fo for the 25th.
george, are we gonna do this or not?
whatsamatter leonard?
i'm happy for you, pal.
i never asked you to quit!
i can't do it, shelly...
a lot that means.
you mean with the flowers...?
damn, fred, you can't give away all those.
i called your god-damned office! i want you to kill him, harry. you'll do that for me, won't you? i loved him, i loved him... that bastard.
you kidding?  we must've killed three pots in there.  anyway, i gotta get home.  rest the pipes.
well, i am.
your handwriting -- nothing more naked. see -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
running out of time, are we? tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
sir, i'm flattered that you even recognize my name. my god, i had no idea you were in hollywood.
what is that you wear?
i'll be back after i make this delivery.
not like this --
eventually.  these things are always a matter of leverage.
make them go faster, mr.... ?
i'm scared.
i feel sad about karen cross, too. i just make like to myself she loves me. i know better, though. it just feels good to me when i imagine it.
little bit.
probation?
that's not what you said. you said if you didn't have a winning record --
i need one hundred thousand dollars.
hi. hi. hi, there my pee and em. all three look up startled.
don't you want to listen to brown's victory speech?
but what if something extraordinary happened?  something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned.
no. it's nothing.
for your sake i hope you're right. i'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
souse! souse! he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
connor, is that you?
how was school?
yeah.
oh. huh. well...  congratulations again, vicki. that's wonderful news.
how much?!
i don't want to. it's different.
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  what is it, bob?!
why what, sir?
that one, last week.
your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-october.
so what ' s up with your dad?  he a pain in the ass?
they said that'd be tomorrow.  they just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
no.
how are you feeling, mr. jimmy? how is your mind today?
did you get this from your lover?
well, if mantini wins, schwartz will leave malkovich, right? so, if he needs it, i help mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. spice up the show.
not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. i mean important. this may be the most important work i've done.
listen, did i tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and clement?  let me tell you.  it's one of the funniest stories --
yeah?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. all we do is use gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, it's a two night operation, maybe three.
nobody here has any idea which way he went?
hello, liberty missoura!
it's just the two of us now, jean luc, as it should be... your ship and mine... you and me.
who? who says that? now that's a malicious lie!
i want the girl.  i don't care about the rest--but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. we'll make headlines all over the world...
he's seen both of us now.
fine nothing!  i didn't want war... my plan was to marry mrs. teasdale and overthrow firefly.
we're a breath away from losing this war.  in the north, washington is reeling from valley forge, running and hiding from clinton and twelve thousand redcoats.  here in the south, cornwallis has broken our back.  he captured over five thousand of our troops when he took charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and new york.
you see it?
i took kobo from the street.  i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man.  kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his oyabun.  he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.
charley, see what kind of "books" mister beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
please...i don know what to do. i'm so cold.
what's wrong?
toto, are you pulling my leg or something? how is it possible to see this television without film?
or flowers.
all i'm saying honey is run the thing past me for christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
dove e stato il signor ripley da allora?
you're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
not at all.
makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. if they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. ever supervise salesmen?
excuse me?
where did you get that thing?
it's about me and david.
i don't have a story.
you must be new in town.
six years.
big threat. tv would ream you.
can i come out?  no.
you got a ten year old attorney, bernie?
jesus christ.
my god! this is way over your head, pal. we need to call some experts and . . .
what did that man mean when he said you were... .?
never, in my whole life, did i swear allegiance to your king --
how are you, honey?  you've met merle, haven't you.  he was with me in vegas.
mr. president--
do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
sorry, but it's out of my hands. try again next year.
well think about it.
why wouldn't i?
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i.  but if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
i was here yesterday.
that's not true.
very well. but if this thing gets worse, we must close. if there's anything you need, call anytime.
does he know that?
everybody has a good time tonight. okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
ya know, i ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
yeah, but i like the sun.  i grew up on a reservation.  the sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  jake's the same way.  he loves the desert.  i guess we're alike that way.  that's about the only way.
or do you have a taste for the good life, ted? it's in your blood.
i want you to fix these fish!
claudia... ain't here, bill.
this way ...
oh man! folklore guy – worked on the railroad. y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. then one day they invented a machine to do it. and he says "fuck that, i'm a man" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. it takes two days. neck and neck the whole time. they get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  got a cigarette?
i said stop, i didn't say run into a brick wall.
you can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. i figured he knew that.
i've got all this back pay coming.  why don't you let me get you a place in town?
how?
you see, kayo, the good lord watches over us after all.
what took you so long?
being as close, i'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
hi, dusty.
i know what i'm asking.  your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  you'll need cash to buy information, and i'll provide it.  i feel responsible, mr. welles.  you saw what he did to her.
the blood transfusion is now in progress. the only words are curt orders like: 'now! - quickly! - that's enough! - give it to me! - sit still!' etc.
good job, not pretty, but good.
yes. not my department ... i'm only records. it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval. i don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose we're all human.
i am him.
...falling... into san francisco bay?
he went to the men's room.
have you heard from judith's parents?
want to come in?  get dry for a minute.
i mean it.  take care of it.
no.
what's up?
there's a certain amount of information there.
...i mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. she's like still a kid, herself.
in the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. way i see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
i'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
schofield? you from schofield?
what are you talking about?
i'm sorry.
getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. what we got here is one mad dog schizo a.i.. armitage is right about one thing, bro. if we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
c'mon, have a drink.  you look like you need one bad as me.
what’s this, a signal? will you come whenever i ring it?
well, you were wonderful on that show. i never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. it's a sin.
hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? we're not a bunch of icy streets here.
does that scare you?
anybody else would have left you by now, but i'm sticking with you. i said i would. and if i got to ride your ass like zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
i've got immunity now. what can you possibly offer me?
you gave them a fresh taste of blood!
if the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
maybe i'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. and a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
you're sure there's more where this came from?
but what if something happens?
oh, the uncle is missing.
do you think he's dead, daddy?
bullshit! your uncle told you!
do the sith know the ways of the force?
yeah, he got her busted for possession...
whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. we've got every right to salvage her.
what's the matter, carlo?
you know any good criminal lawyers?
what are you doing tonight?
chief, it's me. listen carefully. i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead.
frances...
i'm a delta gamma and i'm a huge fan of yours!
watch the show, sid. his basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
you've been perfect.  don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... you ready to dance?
that was a fucking hollow point!
thanks. so what're you doing? on your holidays?
your shot.
oh, it's been abandoned for years.
i'm done with her now. tonight really creeped me out.
you know what happened.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
but how? where do you place paul that night?
from now on, you'll respond only to the name "jay." you'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the ins special services. you're not to stand out in any way.  understand?
were you with jamie?
whom you've seen twice in a year? mrs. kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
so i hear you're taking some time.
i ain't doin' you no way. i just ain't climbin' in that trunk. i got a problem with small places.
escort everyone's favorite she-male over here nice and peaceful-like. let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  i'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
i daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  remember you're in control.
picture's a phoney... cost me a week's pay.
were you?
damn you, long!  my people are out there! your people are out there!
you are a hell of a woman.
what the hell did you think you were doing?
off the record, i don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
who put them up?
well, i've been trusting you all this time, haven't i? we agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
sure. but you want the truth? you're even suspicious of him.
allah be praised. and what battalions will you call upon?
that little punk -- after all i did for him! he said i couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not miss kubelik. what's he got against you, anyway?
we bring greetings from chairman mao.
but you use blood banks --
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
where are they taking him?
lois!
well, what do you know about that!
shit.
hi, chief.  you like the suicide?
so he was indicted?
bullshit.
no?
not that way! through the door!
why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  we been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
what is your name?
don't you want me now leslie
let me ask you, why do you wear black ellen carter? what are you running from?
i show, you give me the information?
macey, i know you're tired, but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way.
oh, don't bother. i got one.  so you're a sicilian, huh?
look.
we're on.
it was adresa de pazzi, depicted as john the baptist.  you have seen the chapel?
i know.  i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
i don't know.
oh, sure. now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
well.  it was a pleasure meeting you.
place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
what'll you do when it all goes wrong?
no, no, no!  you got it all wrong, potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz is right here.  he's with me!
you will?
bobby--
let's see, you're her worried sister.  yesterday i met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. in fact, i capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. they talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
what killed those men?
yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
did your father teach you humility?
i hate to bother you when you're laid up.
oh...  now she's starting.  how do they know?
well aren't you the smoothie. now you're going to ask for my number, i suppose.
is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  for chrissake.  come on.  you don't even have to stay.  jeesuz!  what's the big deal?
can i see your hands?
what do you guys want?
that would seem to be the question of the hour.  i want to build it, doctor.  of course i'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as i said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. i need someone on the inside.
gee, thoughts! alla time thoughts!  you really believe that drool?
why's that?
the reason i can't be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and i may have to help out.
that's what we're doing here. national interest. national security. only this time it's not gold. it's uranium.
did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
about twenty minutes.
you wouldn't like it.  i've been there.
dead, mrs. lampert -- like last week's news -- like charles, mrs. lampert --
no... i can't!
it's supposed to be even hotter today.
east coast people are different.
me too.
any old where ... but not our little richard ... oh no! when you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
i can't stand that polecat. they ought to hang him.
eighteenth century.
do you think i'm having a good time? do you think i'm just *teasing* you? do you think i *know* whether i want you or wally?
hi.
because i am a new man, susan.  i am a man of vision.  your problem, susan, is that you're always looking down.  if you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  they focus on what can be gained.
don't you think he's using you?
that's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
don't be a cop. if you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
we could dye our hair.
is that clear?
got that.
put it on my account, please.
don't worry, charles.  if god is still with her, she will be victorious.  we're not her judges... we're just spectators.  let her go to compiegne, as you let her go to orleans, and let god decide her fate.
you bet.  and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on carl's boat.
give him evidence.
bloody.
that ought to be about the end of that.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
he's just waiting to take me.  when i sleep.
maybe not? i'm feeling lucky ..
okay.
strip down a nun?  you want us to fry?
really?  and maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
good call.
fast work. you just moved here.
well, a guy can win when hildy ain't around.
then you gotta have the talk.
it's vile!
you have an emergency call on your private line.
hey!!
article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
what's your name?
whatever you girls want. it's on us tonight. sky's the limit.
i didn't want to come.
so they'll go.
i feel like we've been at war, charles.
a statistical phenomenon.  says everything in the world goes in streaks.  it's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  bad things cluster.  they go to hell together.
you might be the only one with a job.
i'm feeling very fit, thank you. how is your bronchitis?
good morning, captain pierce and captain forrest.
as if you care.  i saved your life, peck.  those guys woulda killed us!  you wanna give your baby to them?? they eat babies!
surprised?
'a moray eel....'
you're hot!
if i tell you, then it's no fun.
happy birthday, nicholas.
is there more to that, or do i have to guess?
i know.  where are you adam?
i don't know what you want, but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
did you grow up around here?
tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
who's gonna see it there?
you're late. very late.
take it back, freb --
all they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
...a dewars on the rocks and a bud, please.
you sure this will work?
they come after you?
gosh--that'll be something! you know what i better do in the morning?
look -- can great white sharks communicate?  send out signals, or something?  you know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
the wrench, why?
the threat of nuc1ear terrorism has been quelled.  we are in <u>contaot</u> with the albanian premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  that the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
what do you mean?
tomorrow collect from del rio -- he's late three weeks. how'd you do last night?
what'd we here, georgie?
i thought you'd know me by now.
you cannot.
no one can say how the emperor's thoughts work, ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
we're not horse-trading here, wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
me?
it's a woman shot in a car?
aye, sir.
i was just passin' the time.
laurie...
next time, bet with your own kind.
no offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
it's payment day.  loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month.  almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
you must not act impetuously.
ready -- ?
rachel, can i go get my costume on?
and your hand too.
dead people, like in graves and coffins?
who's eichmann?
it's cheaper than cigarettes. and it certainly beats this.
places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. but you don't have to understand. i do. so no talking.
no, he didn't put me up to this. jesus, i don't need people to tell me what i should do. i've just been thinking about things, that's all.
daddy, you home now... that's all i want -- i don't want nothin' else...
you may laugh. caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. you see, i'm ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life. i don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
of course.
what do they have on the streets? the area.  they must have something.
judy.
what are you doing with the gun?
de nada ...
i thought you said no staff, bazza!
that's not what i meant when i asked did you trust her.
we... three bullets.
why?
yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
well, not much longer to go.
you guess? my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt portagee county.
from where??!!
when i think you're ready.
anything special about the case?
brady!
no. i was doing my laundry.
i drive -- and my name is larry.  larry from the states.
yes.  yes, that's eminently fair of you.
i can't. it's too big.
nothing.
who?
what is it?
hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
just get there.
where's mr. johns?
that's bullshit.
me? willie long.
good. i haven't decided yet if i'm a good cook.
i feel like you're turning me into a vcr.
i wanna be sick.
so, then, you're, like, available?
i'm twenty-nine years old. how old are you?
where's the women, man? we gotta have women.
what of?
what's the worst thing you ever did?
drunks.  crawfished a bet, called him a liar.  i saw the whole thing.
let me help you.  betty schaeter, sheldrake's office.
who's ryan cooper?
i suppose i do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
did i hear something about jewels?
you know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
hey.
oh shit. how long did it take?
maybe hallucination is the wrong word. it was more than that. as though they were showing me.
he wants... your "sister"...
what does it mean?
i never used to think i'd do something like that, but now i'm not so sure. you ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
harold ... can i get you anything?
i'm sorry... i... couldn't sleep...
evidence of a massive infection.
the virus itself might have positive applications.  they'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  greg isn't joining us?
what's that?
just let me know when you are going out and where --
zander, what are you doing ?
my father said i should've gotten a lawyer --!
you didn't do nothing.
you know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. it's not fun being exploited. workers have to stand up for their rights.
the woman you're stuck on.
not particularly.
how are you holding up?
see this bullshit...? somebody knows i'm talking to you.
pleasure to meet you, dickie's made a fine catch. i know emily thinks so.
the last few days, um... i've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  i want to tell you... i'm starting to understand why you left me.  i've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... i want to apologize, for all of it.  for shutting you out, for not being there.  i...  anyway, i hope you can forgive me.
the convent was built for over fifty. not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
three words. i did. but you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
what a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
why isn't he dead?  damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
close enough to beam down?
who is your friend?
they you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, mr. spock.
come in.
the front door slammed.  someone went out.  there's a different car starting.
oh my...  don't leave...
this one's a story, but i'm not going to tell you what it is. every time i tell you anything it goes haywire.
when i -- i'm ill, flaemmchen -- it will not be long -- i'll not last long. will you stay with me until...
well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
have you come to talk about me?
i can take it.
sherry   sherry  sheerrry. ...
i had everybody working.  even our old babysitter.
i... we have to bury leon tommorrow...
i wanna fuck darcy.
now what?
they're armed for bear, buckaroo.  check out those radiation levels.
it's not our mistake!
i called a fellow i know in tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. there's a sucker there he says is made for us. and a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! now, i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. we could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
i'm going in, sandy. i'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
you...you dirty bird. she can't be dead. misery chastain cannot be dead! how could you?
uh, sue...?  i <u>can't</u>.
they're saying you killed that policeman.
it's about time.
that's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  huh, mom?
my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
the newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
there are more important matters right now...
what did she do next, mr. roston?
no.  it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
yes i do.
what are we having?
keep stallin'.
pay is so damn low. i don't want my kids to grow up like barney's.
what are you doing?
so you did fuck up.
i can see what you looked like as a kid.
okay...  okay, now what.
why didn't you answer those questions?
yes.
no, i'll get you some tea. wait till you're in naples.  you'll find a girl there.
i'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
linda, you're safe.  ok. it's alright. you're my friend.  you and earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
maybe you can help me. actually, who i'm looking for is a friend of ours from detroit. clarence worley? i heard he was in town. might be travelling with a pretty girl named alabama. have you seen him? are they stayin' here?
but he has been there, off course.
-- i tried, y'know? helen's right. i don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, i've got some.  look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe i shouldn't have gotten in the way. i'm your brother, not your father. go on. you gotta go somewhere? go...
i know that answer. if we went to trial would we win?
amazing.
rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
we're getting out of this place. we've done enough.
and you, keitel blacksmith.
teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. all for one and one for all -- know what i mean?
if there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
hello, gentlemen.  you are the bereaved?
he knows you're aware of that.
friend of gruner. just went along for the party.
well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
...it was six months, and she didn't dump...
yes.
we're a medical firm, aren't we? they go to the medical records section.
i wouldn't be caught dead.  no, it's probably how i would be caught.  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait --
why i'm so lucky. why i should find you waiting for me to come along.
you'll see.
it helped me realize one thing.
maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
two bucks a buckle, perryman. look at that shine! boonies'll cost you five.
you're the best one in your row.
dell, i can't write unless i'm happy, and i can't be happy unless i'm here -- and with you.  this is me, delly.  pete appleton. and i love you!
wrong number  nooooooo!
there's no rush.
what is it, young lady?  what are you staring at?
yeah, i'm kidding, i'm kidding. you don't think i should turn him in... .
aaaank. that's not how we play the game.
what are you thinking about?
they're putting together an agency oversight committee.  they're going to look through everyone's budgets. treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  what am i going to do about that?
well, see ya.
tell me, 007, what do you know about elliot harmsway?
... power ...
he got smooshed. by a jet engine.
i don't understand.
we've declared a curfew.  everyone else is at first positions.
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually. we can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
what do they look like?...
yeah.
and you said...
sergeant west's served for twenty- three years. he's the public face of the modern army.
me?  no.  well, in the accident i was injured, but...
so what's the plan with this ahab? are they selling it or what?
hey man, after all we went through i am not walking out when we're this close.
mmmmmmmmmhm....  now, jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
it was... it was.
when is mommy coming back?
you comin' in to hold my hand?
what were your parents like?
nobody did.
well, we blew it, didn't we?  he ain't wrong.
no, man, i'm doing okay. thanks.
there's no happier thought under heaven.
john!  can you hear me?  are you still there?
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen.
why?
i don't see how you cheating on natalie involves me.
this is the last time, i promise. and i'm keeping strict accounts.
he has a wife and kid.  that's how we'll get to him.
cunt.
i know, but --
but why egypt?
did it do you any good?
and you know, i read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
then let's do it.
isn't it a fact that the "six other asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic mongoloid type, whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean?
who do we interface with on their side?
that fire was set.  deliberately. and probably not by anyone found at the scene.
price!
that thing? who'd you steal it from?
who was it?
he still hasn't shown up. why aren't you in class?
boy, did you see her go?
my god.
...i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something.
why don't you go away?
who were you talking to?
where you going?
who said he's my good buddy?
just says 'won't.'  wait a minute. here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
was that your sister?
where'd they go?
houston, i think we may have a problem.
tell me what to do.
you said you couldn't kill anybody.
-oh please- if i'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. you've been desperate to see africa your whole life.
golly -- i'd like to see all your horses!
you touch me again and--
what truth?
i ain't that dumb, mama. sailor and i been on a crime spree? knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? ain't you read about it?
they say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
i wanted to apologize.
if you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
forget it!
hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
want to come to the study group?
why? why? why? why add to your misery by confessing to murder? you didn't kill him.
mind your own business.
i knew that after the fact.
yeah?  yeah?  okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
oh, no!  it wasn't anything bad. but she just... you know.  i don't know.
baggage handlers.  but when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
yes, sir.
no...i was hoping to get a kiss.
quietly, please. mr. gardiner, for one, understands our language.
lex...lex, how could you do that to otis?
he's coming, electra!  get out now!
neil -- what --
who?
aren't you giving an exam?
deadline?
these rooms are solid stone. they haven't changed.
i want to talk to you later.
c'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
nobody did. you assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
you won't at the square this mornin'.
gillis, get this through your head.  i'm not just your agent. it's not the ten per cent.  i'm your friend.
what are you worried about?  this job is going to last a long time.
it didn't feel like a dream.
thank you.
aaaaawww man, i wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. it's twelve o'clock, man. i'm home, i'm high --
it came over from vietnam, you know.
this is this place called ace vintage, you gotta find it, i don't know exactly where this is and i don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. it's a '61 ac cobra that this old guy says is fine, but i need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. so take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then i'll head down there and check it out.
you know, this is the cleanest cab i've ever been in.  this your regular ride?
some of him… char-broiled bones. teeth. we ruled out suicide.  any bad blood between him and ock?
no!
perfect.  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to --
jim, spock, jim. remember...?
now what?
he's going to run for president.
next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
good evening, baxter.
i forgot where i put my keys.
frida? i was worried to death about you. i've called you for two days. where have you been?
you take care.
hello, again.
avidly.  he was staring.
i saved your life.
that's what he did to me.  he put cigarettes out on me.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
did you call the police?
i don't know about you, but i could use a drink... i'll buy you one.  it'll be my good-bye present.
why not?
of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
you'd like me better that way, jimmy?
where's charlie?
klingon blood.
i didn't want to complicate the situation.
the obituary column?
feeling better, my dear?
uh-uh. i ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. why don't i just ride with you?
i said the truth!
i can't remember.
he working for them on this one?
i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
i made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
you're not telling us something.
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine. section 22350 of the commerce code.
what should i do?
i know —— i shouldn't have told you—
well if anyone's gonna protect malcolm's legacy it better be us.
thanks, joe.
yes, ma'am.
you told us about the appearance of this... voice.  what exactly did you see?  part of it... or all of it?
what?  <u>why</u>?
the men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
enough joking.
glaucoma?
these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression.
yes.  thank you.
hi. i'm john triplette.
is that it, bruce?  i'm under some magic spell?
really?
somebody broke in.
you're really doing a great job here, josie. i like your "can do" attitude.
so how long am i supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
yeah, yeah, i stay at the four seas, it's ease.
i don’t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
so tonight's the night. are you two excited?
i could work even after the baby comes. a few hours a week, anyway.
just cover wood, maverick. mutual support, man!
you don't know the underhills?
-- that can't happen.  earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
well that's lovely talk, that is. and another thing, why aren't you at school?
not yet.
i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
do i know you?
you're bleeding.
still, 'old friend.' you've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
and these were drawn from life?
any attacks of pain since?
his moods at this time were complex and varied.
okay.   okay.    i believe you.
you ordering chop suey again?
report to weapons. we're going on a hunt.
nothing! that's absurd. i heard you laughing and talking, she was asking questions.
shit. it's neil prescott's car.
tosh!  fettes!  it's not their grief i'm worrying about -- i'm talking of our own end --
hon, did you get expelled?
i don't care about your sword.
i'm doing an interview.
how heroic of you...
what happened at the luau?
what about this one?
<i>the bounty hunters have arrived. they will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>where do you want to meet?</i>
are you sure you’re okay?
sir, i was wondering ...
i had to smuggle it in here. i guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
you're now mantan.
forty-five seven!
we find the man and then we dissect him-
thank you very much.
keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
sidney, can i talk to you a minute?
is he here?
...ergency procedures.
at what?
sue. your clothes. lose them.
yes money. adam had a five hundred dollar term life insurance policy.
say, is maya working?
it's boring, isn't it?
i never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. i--i don't know where i'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
erik! row! what are you doing?
what evidence? no weapons were found in the cave.
is there a press conference today?
you're poisoning that child's mind.
are you familiar with magnets?
mr. sulu, what is the crew complement of a bird of prey?
shit.  i'm gettin' tired.
it's for you. frida.
alright, i'm here. now what?
what do you expect me to do?  what in the world -
chill.  we don't want your face coming off with it.
we must be careful.  governor yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  it might get sir te in trouble.
don't be. they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york.
don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
stacy, don't hang up.
you got a suitcase?
i don't drink.
carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
you don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
say thank you.
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. mr. o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe?
whoever it is, now is taking credit for maureen prescott's murder.
wendy?
i'll call you.
i don't know anyone who fits the description.
ya little bitch, you like it don't you! you like it this way -- rough and hard. gotta go fuck around on me, like your mama, but you always gotta come home to daddy, don't you, cause you know daddy's the best.
good. stay in that frame of mind.
she's in the other room.  i just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. but it's time for her to die now.
should i have?
i don't think i'm gonna take it.
a star is...
that's not so.
great.
hey, you're perfectly safe.
aren't you scared?
you mean not enough to save you.
glass will cut glass, mrs. langtry. do you know where it was purchased?
well, it's the jack kennedy syndrome, huh?  you die young, you always look golden.  perfect.  the memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
where are you going?
blessings on thee, the both...well... gotta run now.  see you two kids later!
:would you stop it!
well, there's fishing and boating. there's concerts on the mainland and... but i feel silly telling you. this is really your home. you probably know better than i what there is to do.
yeah.  i'm probably ruining them.
that's what i want.
it's time to make amends.
damn!
yes.  i might not have been shot.
he wouldn't take it on the helicopters. he'd transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront...
marriage can really complicate things. so, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
hi, guys. we brought back a friend.
could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
you want to sleep in my bed tonight?
what's your hurry?
for a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
yeah. i'm registered for this class.
tell her, tell her...i had to go to fiji. i'll call her when i get there.
it's going to be a cozy weekend.
where's israel?
what?
tom, you're all heart.
what are you doing?
you said the worm was untreaceable!
just a minute -- just a minute -- i have nothing against the idea but i still say let's go back to the hotel terminus. moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
what have i done?
one i gave him, yeah.  fuck...
i have these strange thoughts, i don't know where they come from.  i can't explain it.
i thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
you'd said something about proof...
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless..
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess. i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
uh-huh.
kip?
there'll be someone else.
niki. calm down. relax. let's just talk for a while. then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
did you see the papers today?
fifteen.
what do you mean ?
fraulein -- will you permit me?
your baby. the baby you're carrying around inside you.
we've got to get the nanobot.
oh, like that song...
seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
you?
did you call anyone?  did you call her house to see if she got home?  did you call the masons?
the point is this -- i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?
you'll do it?
you just feel sorry for me.
he helps administer the charities now, and i give him a reasonable allowance.  he has no money of his own.  i know how he likes to present himself; father's weakness is vanity. hence the slut.
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.
he cared enough to want you to have it.
go fuck yourself...
very good, sir!  i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
really?
what is it, doctor? what's happening?
i - just - thought - that - i - didn't want - i - didn't - i - didn't -
none.
i want you for my roommate.
she grew up.
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston.
no, no.
how can you tell that from a thermometer!
i want you to stop all this nonsense, jim.
why, well i think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
oh baby... oh baby...
mom?
two miles! minefields over there. do you know where this campground is or not?
that's crazy talk.
which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, john.
dil! dil! what the fuck are you doing here?
... ja-ck b-ar-t-le-tt... is jack bartlett interested in me?
well, it you're not gonna ask, then i will. how was it?
is that what you think?
what did you just say before? about water flowing through them?
catholicism is not on trial here. i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
so you killed him?
ellen, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
why don't you give 'em a call.
i mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  and you're going through them quick.
i don't want land.
it was a ouija board, remember?
merci.
where does it make berth?
we're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
eddie... what's a dd-5?
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. when you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. that scares her more than anything.
where are you?
so your argument is that title dictates behavior?
their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
i can't keep it to myself anymore--
i've got to tell you, mr. bonanno, this guy's an idiot. how he's lived this long is a mystery.
i cannot stay.
otherwise known as an orgy?
a blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
hey, dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
llewelyn?
you keep drivin' down ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. we're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  hey, where's melanie?
it's the influence of all those family films.  right, mom?  hey, mom??... 
the 1000 c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness. i keep the samples straight by touch code.  it's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. think it'll do?
you wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
denning was wearing a bug.
the ark of the covenant.
they learned.  they cut the power and avoided the guns.  they must have found another way in, something we missed.
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
mr. lebowski is disabled, yes.  and this picture was taken when mrs. reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? not of california.
well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
what?  oh.  i used to do gymnastics. are you looking for someone?
so why, after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house, does the senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
okay, fine.  so...stay out of it.
something was wrong.
...and we're looking at nigerian crude...
well?
yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which i don't see how you could know about in such detail. how does lee know about these things?  how?  they're private!
it's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and i know them.  nothing alive looks like that!
her condition isn't quite what it seems. nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. the ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
you are late.
i might as well be rowan smith - or jones!   you cut me off from every -
well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
you kiss by the book.
because i just think you two would hit it off real well together.
paul! paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste.
this better not be a wild goose chase.
this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
pinot grigio.  we're considering it for the appetizer.
and the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
you have?  will you come in a minute, miss saunders.
what do you figure it is?
please, sylvia!  it's a quarter to nine!
i'm not leaving my daughter behind.  not with them.
yes!  when i give the word -- throw the first switch!
dear christ...
this used to be mine. i give it to grampa when i went away.  you reckon they could be dead?
get out. both of you.
it came from your hip.  under the skin.  you have a bank in zurich.  you remember zurich?
don't make so much out of it.  only reason i haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  believe me; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had.  i'm no better than anybody else.  i've just been busier.
it's no use, dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
yeah.
you sure?
tell me about doctor paley?
the public loves you jack...you don't mind if i call you jack, do you?
it's time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border.  it's time to tell the citizens everything.  will you write it?
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you?
don't let me slow you down.
so you do eat pussy!
who are you?
fight what?
"theo?"
i saw blood! and it's brown! not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
wh-- wha--
we can't just leave him.
you rigged the illusion to fail, right?
i was so goddamn close, finnegan! so goddamn close to my island... i could almost taste the sand...
i wouldn't let you. good luck with depinto.
thank you.
you said i was a lady in distress.
are you fucking with me sheila? is something gonna happen to buzz? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo, but is unable.
maybe he didn't like us.
do you?
let's head for texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
"but" what?
yeah, well, it's a theory. here's your novril.  how does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
i'll send your regrets.  honestly, why must i even bother?
hello, claire.  how extraordinary that you came.
a good thrust, my friend. another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
oh please! i'm surprised i didn't kill you.
inoperative.
i don't know -- maybe twenty miles... of course i'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to i mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
sergeant major? how is richie doing? private graves?
you... .
i can try my father's safe. i'm sure i can get the keys to his office.
along with mr. mulwray.
huh?
continue.
how cold?
the dreams again, sir?
is it cold in here?
huh! who do you think we are, mr lombard?
i ching?  you threw a man out a window!
no. we're going to lock this up and --
a sea-gull? what's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? that's a bad omen, isn't it? 
where are we going?
where?
oh, cut my finger.
i need you to stake me.
how much?
uh-huh.
he owns it. you know?
i've never done this before.
you only brought one ball?!
figured it out.
maybe i need to do a lot of things.
three years. that crime's old, man. they ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. how they gonna find room for you?
we already have. your father is the man who's disappeared.
how do i get out of here?
good morning, sefton.
the refridgerator.
but who would be chosen?
so does anybody have any suggestions?
thirty-five next generation microchips. copper, not silicon. value: one million each.
dawson, sir.
that's my dad.
could you give me a ride?
we have to get through to the other side.  you up for it?
what do you mean?  i'm just doing what we've always done.
well, mr. smarty-pants detective, your logic is specious.  what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
that's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
violet bick!
go ahead.
yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
my debrief --
well, not exactly s...
bullshit. these are classy customers. you can't show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on.
you two fighting's not going to get us anything.
suppose you listen just for a minute -
they're following us.
just a little.  who knows what we're going to find in there.  it could be a huge excavation.  a little friendly pr never hurt.
what's so funny?
i'm tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
let me go!  godammit, frank let go!
actually, i'm waiting for someone.
you didn't get me in trouble.
hmmmm, interesting.
you want to see me, senator?
bob was a champion bodybuilder.  you know that chest expansion program you see on tv?  that was his idea.
my god...
this, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
mom!
no, he just hung out there.
i have always asked for plain information. just the truth.
jack, i was just trying to help.
so this...foam you found in the lungs.  how does it get there?
the door must not be opened. the barrier must not be crossed. don't go on, doc. no matter how much you feel you have to. there's more power here than you know.
and what's that?
it is sacrilege!
myra.
fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, albert! i mean, what do you think?
you need a warrior for this job. i'm nobody.
and the chair.
so could you write down her exact address?
i'm married.
oh! oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. listen, dorothy, don't let hunk kid you about miss gulch. she's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. you know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
i didn't know you could read.
you're right. i know.
well filmore--
unfortunately.
the answer is no.
i didn't do it. i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
maybe it's happy there.
aren't i, like the chosen one?  the one and only?  the grand high poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  like, ever?
it wasn't you.  it wasn't personal...
i'm sorry that i frightened you like that.  but i was so touched by your concern.  i've been lonely here.  perhaps we could be friends.
woody, we don't know what's out there!
he gives me a total boner!
i just wish she'd get here, that's all.
alright, alright.
drive.
then why haven't you detected any signals?  if, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  it'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
patrizia, don't start in again... i would rather be called depraved. unless you happen to love children.
very instructive
grigory -- that's russian, right?  thought they were on our side...
you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
you see!  you see!
he's a boxer. a flyweight.
i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers... and i remembered where they are...
she staying with you?
uh oh... don't turn around...
none.
oh -- marty -- what time did you say it was?
chet won't know anything.  we'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
right.  what do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
as mr. christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
huh?
you closed 'em today?
i'm sorry, mr. massey, but i felt certain you'd want to know -- marylin rexroth wants to see you.
you... suck!  you almost got us all killed!
the police?
just what?
did i what?
hmm! so am i. if you'll excuse me i have some important unfinished business. i'll see you all later.
you don't have to drown that fella, spanky. you already scared him half to death. he didn't know who he was fucking with.
relax, that's my ma's code for, "bring home milk and a carton-a luckys."
what time is it?
oh, i hope so my darling.  but let me switch on the light.
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
she can never be cured?
don't worry, rose, i won't tell a soul.
but where did they get those people?
she's...pretty fast.
he's a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.
i'm going' to the fbi! i'm not scared anymore!
i am so ashamed.
did he -- you know?
you want the cake!?
no.
what guy?
where are you staying in vancouver royal. it's pretty crowded you know.
where are you now?
an old flame?
hello...?  who is this...?
but will it--hurt the baby?
well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
ellie --
toby's right. they're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
i wonder if we ought to--
all right, riley.  what the hell happened?
oh, thank you very much.
it's on...
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
they want you to quit the muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
call me les.
what?
do you think i must?
yep.
-- took a bus.
ml stands for ml.  that's it.
all your soldiers speak latin?
run for what?
well, what's the difference? i just need it.
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  i log on at the library so i can't be traced.
boats.  all anyone talks about is the wind.  is it up, is it down.  i can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
marvelous!  "at two o'clock this morning, mr. deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. when asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'i just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  beautiful! what happened after that?
i thought this look like your work.
2:00 a.m.
what are you-
i'll be damned.
i'm in position, scarecrow.
...need those cells from the crash ship. shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
i'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
barak is still strong in the north, and tendo holds the high passes. but the great desert forts have fallen.
now--turn around, if you would.
let's get out of here.
check it out butt-head, tv!
that's the way it is, man. cellars are dark.
how much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
josé...
admiral on the bridge --
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter?
it's holding... she's holding...!
not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
that's not true...
nothing is going on with us, is it?
yeah ...
so now i see where you're coming from.  just because we ain't rapping about gucci, timberland, rolex, benz, cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
young masbath, i am sorry for your loss.  it is a great and sad tragedy. however... i cannot be the one to look after you now.
hello, charlie...  c'mon in...  that's my girl.
i said i was too young to drive.  i didn't say i was stupid.
it's there. the fog's thicker now, but it's there. what do you think started those fires?
how much are they paying you to be here?
elementary, mrs. peel. trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
so, eh, you never saw me. right?
i'm concerned about her health.
he means that much to you...?
sewing...
get 'em on line, then stall.  long can't have gotten far.
this convent is locked solid. the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldn't let christ in after dark.
i don't trust her.
general, hang on... drink slowly. you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight.  a fan sent them to you.
your buddy. that fat guy. the king couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. he didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. it ain't personal. it's business.
well, you ever need one, i know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. lotsa shit around.
will.
i can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
no, i mean in your pregnancy.
i... i...
as a representative of moscow...
where have you been?
what do you need?
eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
fuckin a, i think i got two partial prints here!
i dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
not all think it is the horseman. many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer, offering death as tribute.  and, still others believe none of it.
hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
i wonder what it's like being you. being noticed all the time.
how long?
a man can change his history.
less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  it'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies.
do you think they ever existed?
no, baby... i'm glad you're coming tonight.
excuse me. i have something i'd like to discuss with you.
i tried again and got through.
i know exactly what you mean.
he works for frank abolofia. atlantic city.  casinos.
the men. do any of them still live around here?
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off.
marty, let's go downna seventy-second street area tonight.
why are you here, then?
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth. they call it le coeur de la mer, the --
have you got a minute?
i didn't say anything.  what's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, colonel?
yes...
so work must be going well?
besides, it's historically inaccurate.
come home, dean.
still think cuba isn't important?
no way! you're kiddin'!
ha, ha, oh, i love you, too.
this town sucks.
great...
don't look so freaked.
you gotta stop calling los angeles .. you're dragging l.a. around with you like an addiction.  look at the shit you're putting yourself through? for what? for <u>nothing</u>, i know it, i been there. remember me? up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  if there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. let somebody else worry about it. you gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
you were right.
i've got numbers to back me up. over the course of one year more americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of world war ii.
they're all the same.
they don't want to come down.
will he talk to me?
have you looked inside?
yeah.
aha! finally. i've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio.
yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
right.
agnes...
i've done quite well in denver, mr. garrison, but i have to admire someone like you - and i have the means to back up what i say.
atr setting...
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i'd be greeting you as a national hero.
you won't have long to wait. in just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. off with you now, amy. go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
i love you, my brother, do you know that?
no.
deploy the collector.
nick...
i don't know, he wasn't my case. why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended?
ogg's footprints!
raoul, no... you cannot do this.  no matter how your heart is broken --
well we're off and running.  just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental.
i get it, enzo you were a superior child.
if he does it again, he's out for good. i don't care what it is, nick, i'm gonna ha- i'll - i'll never let him in the place again.
why would i do that?
i needn't keep you any longer, mr. clarendon.
in here, says he wants a million.
you - wait! you didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
i want you to check this out, ellie.
what are you talking about? what difference--?
so where's all your stuff?
what can we do?
i think you better put that away.
so am i.
you were ok for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but i think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though i told you that we had plenty at home. in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. i asked you if you knew it was a hundred. you said you did, so i let you do it. we got here, you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed.
he wants to meet you. he called last night and asked me to set it up. what do i tell him'
to get some frozen poultry.
in the middle? you've got the mask, why don't we have him?
you know, i saw you guys once. you and frank.  at the roosevelt.
a fucking c.d.  wow, this case is closed.  so, she's got bad taste in music and in men... did i tell you she and johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
well, shall we go through documentation?
yeah.
huh?  no, really, i don't even have the bruise any more, i--
you try and have a good time.
how long you been riding with buckaroo, reno?
don't tell me: you're from outer space.
negative helm control, captain! going reverse on impulse power...!
hey, sam, we're flat broke.
they blame you for the compromise.
doing what?
it's better than real. it's synthetic flesh. synthetic blood. synthetic organs...  it's a physiological machine.
you work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i've got her money.
what's the thing with morse code...
you're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
but--i've done everything i--
what did you do?
who said that?
like cocoa puffs.  good.  captain crunch.  bad.  shreds the roof of your mouth.  i mean you hear, "tricks are for kids!"  and you think, "i'm a kid, i guess they're for me."  but your baby brain's got no idea that fruit loops are, like, a million times better.  i'm going to save our kid all that pain.
look at jeannie's kid.
oh, roy, it was great! we were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
ssh. don't want babe to hear.
don't call me a bum! i ain't no bum!
molly!
ok, i'm fine.
i called dr. styles at the neurological institute  in l.a., remember...?  he said he'd see you.  he was intrigned.
double-strength!
my wife's death. i used to work in insurance, we were well covered.
jesus!
you said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. this gives me the creeps.
oh, come on, come on!
- well? what happened?
they are useless! it was kirk i needed. and i let him slip away.
me, too.
les, i got mr. lonnegan with me. he wants to see you a second.
well, that's the state's offer. if you plead to possession and tell l.a.p.d. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. if you don't, l.a.p.d. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. if you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up.
relax, kid. it's only me and my big mouth...
what?
why don't you two get out there and dance?
tell me again -- what's my name?
got it ...
....with a woman's touch.
what happened to them?
dade?
perfect.
we're wasting time.
i can't take you to my place.
what happened?
dr. hirsch will know what to do.
where are they?
i need your help and i thin you can use mine.
anything...anything the godfather wishes.
captain, belay that order!  bob, where's that coming from!
i'm afraid that drink will have to wait, captain.
yeah, eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the yellow pages.
i could stand some more--
pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
no thanks.
warsaw radio. i was a technician. i saw you almost every day.
the old man? he's gonna tell you who killed leo?
call bob and reed.  tell them i need them immediately.
what do i have to do?
i'm thinking.
this is a sign! someone's coming to take buzz away from me. i don't know if you're the guy or what, but i'm not letting it happen. i'm leaving him first.
after god... before the waste-paper basket.
oh, but it's not. if i hadn't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, i never would have took off for new york. i never would have met keaton, see. that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
no.
mom?  you okay?
i'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
burgel! -- i didn't leave it with him.
i love gifts.  what did you guys get us?
he comes over to study.
i am not!
i don't wanna come along with you.
what kind of deal you looking to?
you like it?
this used to be a real city. i was here about fifteen years ago. embezzlement case. it was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. with a downtown and all.
i got a dress.
i'm still not confident we can ride through this.  some people are going to have to go to jail.  hunt's not the only problem.  haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the ellsberg break-in. and i'm ... uh, i think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
cell phone.
buddy, i don't know if that's such a good idea.
i'm wasting time.
because they got wet.
[who killed her? you?]
well, there he sits.  it's not supposed to make sense.
hey, guys. how's it going?
i won't calm down. i can't do this. we can't do this. it won't work. it will not work.
how does he do that?
made me sick, but what did i care? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  it was just something i was doing for money.
goodnight.
you're describing half the high school girls in america.  what is she doing right now?
okay. all our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. let's keep chilly. think slow. any questions?
you have to think about the shot. it's the shot. the shot's it.
okay, okay -- "leader of the pack." the guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "dead man's curve," jan and dean...
how old are you?
your friends at warren, putnam and hudson.
what do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
c'mon, man.  one more sweep.
their arms?
i miss her.  what do you think happens to someone after they die?
i'm afraid i don't...
what is that supposed to mean...?
...i hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... this man's the best damn abortionist in the south.
colonel greenhill's compliments, sir. the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field, fully armed and...
you can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  so what? am i gonna go off and be a race car driver?  go to harvard?  run for president?  what about you, pops?
thank you.  it's in remission now, thank the lord, but you never know.  and then while that's going on, i end up having to have a hysterectomy.  plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  all benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
what is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
there's one thing i don't understand.  the thing i don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
i'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
that's natural.
about a dog.
get some sleep.
[he'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
it hasn't adjusted.
ravenous homosexual.
yes, you can. i've got it set up. we'll be fine. all i need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. i've got a guy in here from pittsburgh who'll move it for me. believe me, in a month we'll be fine. we won't need anybody.
am i what?
what am i gonna do?
i'll look over the q and a.
what d'ya got?
seriously, though: we're going to eat, i said.
yeah, they're in the snow.
he <u>is</u> batman, you moron.
down?
no, all the good ones are married. that's why brad thinks he's god's gift to women. this woman anyway. he's single. he won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. and he knows it.
what the fuck. my day's already ruined.  give me the keys. you can go back with jack. you still got a shitload of plowing to do.
captain barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
what it smell like?
what?
a living fossil!  like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
god help me -- yes.
that's your problem.
see?  wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
now wait a minute, hawkeye. i come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy yankees, but...
come here.
don't worry about it, dick.  barry's an asshole.
we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.
on three?  you call it.
yes, will. i didn't even know that?
why are you talking like that?
well, can you give him this for me?
she works for tips!
his last fight was his best, jeff. he and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. you know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
sean, this is important. and it's above personal rivalry--
yes.
you're wastin' your time.
did you talk to him?
i gotta tell ya, dave.  i've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  who does these books?
right home after.
what about the last of the big-time spenders.  you make him?
just the ten thousand'll be fine.
hey butt-head, i'm starting to feel weird. i think i'm freaking out.
look at you.
let me hear you say that! i so unhappy she runned away that i killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
i mean they want to get caught.
well i of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course i've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
many times.
are you all right, marty? you seem a little...nervous.
yeah --
do you know me?
some people said that.  i never thought so.
hey.  way to gut it out.
fill her up?
yeah.
thanks.  this is my exit so, i --
no. oh, richard, i'm sorry. i'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. if you don't help us, victor laszlo will die in casablanca.
what?
... eve - this has been an exhausting day for ben...
it will be just the same.  enough! i'm tired.
we never met. that's why.
she's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. the noise alone kept me up.
this is crazy. no one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
why?
they arrived.
a piece of advice, mr. bond: don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  it's deadlier than uranium.
michael you're trying to scare me...
karl if you put this in regan's room i want you to tell me, now did you?
i often do.
i'm not losing it again!
help you?
and you know smokey has emotional problems!
what are you talking about, asshole?
whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
how's the store?
sorry folks, i don't do couples.
i'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
where did you get that sweater?
i'm so glad to have met you at last. you're just as nice as amy told me you were.  i hope you'll come to see us.
okay, lieutenant dish. i guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
"a little mistake"!
are you crazy?
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
this was not taken from a grave.
- and he seemed okay.  just banged his -
you have ten seconds.
what are you doing?
i'm only human, you know.
but, the expectation was ten.  and, in this case, expectation is everything.
you have a bay?
so what's in the boxes? heroin? cocaine?
alright. prep the clark for launch. i'll find her.
no. you're with who you should be. it's like she chose you.
a million years behind us.  jor-el, he's only a baby.
i just though you were awful cute.
i'm out, johnny.
we're gonna save you, noel. you're gonna be all right.  do it, tom! i'll call for fucking backup, i swear!
hold on.
it's a big building with patients. but that's not important right now. tell the captain i must speak to him.
which would you rather...?
well, where i come from it kind of goes with the territory.  texas.
what the hell are you doing here?
well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. about us. about those bodies. about the gold. seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
this man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
look, harlin.
well mary, it's too bad i didn't know -- i would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in washington -- have another piece of pie -- 
at the bottom of mines?
it's beautiful!  what are you waiting for?
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
yes, he does.  may i try?
tell me something, stamp. tell me this one thing. how much is a nigger supposed to take?
i didn't know you were a stick man, rambo.
she's only 12.  some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "i love you."
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that's funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, i'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
no way. i'm so happy i'm about to bust. here, honey. this is for you. it cost me my whole savings, but i said what the fuck.
david! you're hurting my feelings.
as a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. you were in your - uh - shorts. yes, sir.
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
you're from detroit, near where i come from. you majored in education at tuskegee. you're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
excuse me. i was just going up to my room.
told him you could get him a snuff film.
and i want to know where.
judge man. watch yourself. sabu's got juice now.
he told me he was turning in early...
fundoscopic examination --
never heard of k-mart?
they bombed us, we're off the air.
pack up. i'll see you get back to london.
i've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  well, what's your opinion, leonard?
you never said anything to me...
you're really terrific, you know what i mean --linnea rolls over and faces him.
i figure maybe we can get the fbi to make a deal ...
to be determined by the proper authorities.
but you're not fat, mrs. rieper!
nooo.  i just thought...  l mean, i am looking for a new car.  but i just thought, well, i'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, i don't know, i just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. real friends.  and then things would be different.  don't you think?
so, what about you and that poletti girl?
before we go in i gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
don't be such a pansy. all of this is yours.
we got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. the day after that they're shippin' mallory. that's when we do the mickey knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
she's an officer.  there's a higher standard.
—do you?
do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! for cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
what? the tapes?
i just talked to him.
i am, this is it.  b day.
yes, ma'am.
tomorrow! joe--he'll hear the section on willet dam. he can't be there!
yeah, good, ok.
well, you be careful with that boy, lula.
why?
go on in.
he made friends with a family called columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, caroline.
it's no big deal.
why don't you just leave it alone?
i don't wanna talk about it.
same thing, y'knowwhati'msayin', y'knowwhati'msayin'!
you can't blackmail me, rogers, you can't -
why not? i'm not charging you for the time i wasted.
best in mexico.
it's on national television, barnett.
yes.
and i can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
why don't you call him?
we're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
two.  gabriel and thomas.
what do you think?
psychiatrist said i was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so marty fired him.
are you my attorney?  i'm emil.  i'm insane.
that this was going to be a key party?
there may be a hunting party.
ivory.
both, actually.
naw. i'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
mulholland drive.
guess we better get going, huh?
look at him, whitney. come all the way from england to clean up california. huh!
holy saint francis, what a change is here! is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
for example?
if i want to be one with them, i have to live like them.
the bijou?
what's this?
you're just jealous.
you're wasting our time: there's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
so how's school treating you?
i don't think so, but if that's what you want...
yeah, but roselli wasn't just any gangster.  he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba.
thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that i really think i could have been something ... special.
are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
she's the most wonderful woman in the world. can't get her out of my mind.
you want some advice, friend? you get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
as i am sure you are aware, professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why i've given them special consideration.
look, get down off my property.
ok.  taking golitsyn's exit.  jack, open the doors.
you're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  i mean, i just wanna know.
anything wrong?
oh, just traveling through, huh?
you're cute. you have any money, claude?
are you going out with jeffrey tonight?
fifty per cent?
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs. hallstrom's milk.
my husband tells me you're in sharks.
can we talk price?
don't worry, we'll take care of it.
you son of a bitch!  you said you wouldn't kill him!
that stuff'll kill you quick, man.
well, i can.  some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  i'm not a silly carhop any more.  maybe you're right about fish. when i was a carhop, i didn't feel much more than a fish would.  but i've been sensitized.  i have ideas now--and solid information.  i know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
blue eyes?
well, don't be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
you used my savings!  you stole my savings.  if my father were here...
no.  it was my singing.
just do like i tell you -- i'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
no!  you're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing i can't sleep otherwise.
they gonna drive me anyways. soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. until then...
all right, how about ringo? i mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
so mr. kirby, tell me, when you climbed k2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
and what will i live on? my oil wells in texas?
... who are you?
now dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. i know who's got the money 'n i ain't disappearing till i got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
yes but i was a boy. and i still had hell to pay.
love.
i've got it.  he bends down and bites the back of her neck.
are you threatening me?
you looking' for some company?
oh, hi.  i'm glad you made it.  did you bring anybody?
we both lied to him.
all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.
marry who?
howard hunt? ... jesus christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
what?
a what?
i'd kill it.
i can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
seven, eight.  so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what i'm doing, and i start trying to explain to her, about this state that i can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
xxxxxx.
still studying the vase. mariette appears. he turns to her.
i'm telling you god's words, not no hustle. i'm talking the words of elijah, the black man's god. i'm telling you, boy, that god is black.
but edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
she's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
or the vitamins? or the...?
you're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, ms. grey.  three words: are mutants dangerous?
she lived in tarzana.
dad...
well a lot of things cross my mind. i've always been a fast thinker, ev. i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
you must survive, luke.
sir---
...embarrassing, shameful...
yeah.  i saw one of 'em outside.
shit.
...hey, i know what i'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
... when i don't. it comes down to one thing, mrs. peel. trust.
shoes too?
this simon.  did you sleep with him?
i'll go on a hunger strike. i know your caper. the kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. the third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
i though we went over this.
an actress.
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus?
don't start, alright.
back it down, johnny!
i suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  but...
where were you sitting on the train?
corleone.
there's three.  the first is 1983. lionel baines.  the boston...
over three-hundred.
nobody really wears that stuff, paloma.
same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your valentine's card.
you're joking.
you gave them me.
what is this....
no, they're not.  i'd say your investment was paying dividends.
are you insane? you've to get out of here at once! she may come back any minute.
ray -- ray -- how do you feel, man?
thank you, madame.  come on now - courage. play me something you know.
i missed you too.
jessica.
what was i wearing?
as opposed to?
their check's no good?  they're nuts...?
--i'm not interested in theory. what do we know? for example, hunt's disappeared.
captain...  you wanna take'er up...?
this is nainsukh -- from the village. they bring him here to dig in the mines.
it would be a nice change from you.
remember when senator hamersley died in an accident up near shenandoah?
jackie --
your first homicide, that's gonna happen, ray...
you rally think this'll draw the parent?
no no. i'm a psychologist, but i do research. i'm a behaviorist. i work with animals. mice at the moment.
i had a father who knew how to steal.
here's my proposition, mr. nugent.
sure they do. but outside they've got trees around them. the trees shade them from the sun. of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. one of nature's symbiotic relationships.
shut up.
i agree --
you don't believe that do you?
yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
he's right there... he can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. the sky is going to open up... and then he will reveal himself to me.
why?
sixteen years? howard jr. is fourteen and mandy must be what -- twelve?
can i ask you about melanie?
and i don't need sue ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
you've asked why i stay a bachelor? there goes the best reason i know!
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. i don't understand. what's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
paula, he dored and nobody's seen him.
talk away, professor.
the art of transformation!
he could get into people's heads. make them see things. terrible things.  and he could levitate. juggle fire.
alright.
do you know it like that? by heart.
what is enterprise's proper evolvement?
why did you unleash the pipe, i don't know?
christ almighty, george.  feed her a cheeseburger or something.  what does she weight, eighty pounds?
no uniforms.  no coats, even?  in this weather?
jules, what's wrong...
wasn't no problem a mine.
uh-huh.
where's the submarine? it's disappeared off our screens.
it is  jon.  twenty-four years ago.  before he turned into dr. manhattan.
some party.
yes. i will.
i wish you'd stop being playful.
what was all that?  who was that man? why would he shoot at us?
it could be a fire.  this is malibu.
you know i'm always happy to see you, jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
in my jacket. left inside pocket.
he's directing now.
just do it.
thank you for coming so quickly.  the guests are starting to ask questions and i'm running out of excuses.
and they grow out of our stomachs?
terrific.  i'm doing vegetables next week.
i understand he cut you pretty good...
living proof.
wow your body's really hot.
i'm a man. she's, you know, a woman.
depend on it. no s. your subject is plural.
my encounter.
why, mr. stone, you look so worried. can i be of any service?
and what do you suggest i do about it, dear boy?
"as he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, the bishop muttered a latin prayer. and then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
were it only that easy. i have obligations. the order needs to be filled...
i can take care of myself.
and laszlo?
so, william randolph. your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
you alright?
well?
you think you're not in prison now? living in a grey little room. going to a grey little job.  leading a grey little life.
the ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
rose, you don't have to.
murdered?  why?
what's the problem? you don't like me -- don't like the turtles -- what is it?
potentially.  this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
me neither, but the upshot is i've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it doesn't look good.
why not?  he keeps marrying girls all the time!
no.  i mean, are you sure?
want some gum?
what year do you think it is?
bates' motel.  he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... go on, sam.
yes.  oh my, i suppose i should call them again. they said three o'clock.  maybe it's the traffic. i'll call. would you mind waiting?
i don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  this terrain is hopeless.
ready lloyd?
pinback...
see you tuesday, frank.
oh my god, jake, no.  if it is someone they'll go away.  or call the police.  don't go out there.
i...i can't...
but it's a responsibility being a berserk.
are you kidding? mom and dad discover i'm gone and i'll be doing hard time.
that's not necessary.  you're in.
i just want to sit here longer, i mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
i hope you find him.
not...complaining, actually.
oh god, if only i'd known.
jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
what?!  a light!  yes, i've got a light!
don't be dense. the party.
the money's in a broadway shopping bag. i get some food, and sit down here in the food court. then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
excuse me?
time is running out. we have to go see grandma death. we have to talk to her.
look, she walked out on her own child, right?  that's desertion, right? mr. shaunessy, i'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
what day is it?
... how could i what?
i've heard a name.  someone they talk about in whispers.
make yourself right at home.
she has spoken to me. i heard her voice. there was no sound, but i beard it here . her voice was there in my head. i watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder i listened the clearer i heard her, as clear as i hear you, as dear as i hear my own voice.
oh. jesus.
about what?
lizy, eliza... elizabeth bennett...  pride and prejudice.
by whom? the marquis?
for pete's sake, hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
go fuck yourself.
wes won't show it until it's finished. that's what he told me, at least.  i asked him at the funeral.
are you okay?
sid —— no!!!
look at that.
neither am i.
we’re friends, aren’t we?
no. we shouldn't touch that money. we don't know about that money. that might be dangerous money. you have to start all over again. you look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
i'm too old for this shit.
no.
you have an awfully nice habit, sam.
your honor, mr. roston lived with the defendant for many months.  i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson.
well, why don't you use them?  when you come home, don't go by miss gulch's place.  then toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  see?
debi's house.
yeah, well the only woman of the indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet ... they both looked mad enough to kill him...
underwear?
i'm cancelling the engagement.
caesar, you still got the money?
bullshit, nick.  and don't tell me this is all just about charlie. it's not.
how is the children's progress?
if you ask us, no. if you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
where did you meet him?
welcome to ya. what's your name?
we had information bearing on mr. kim's desire to gain admission into the joe boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
they're going to hang you.  why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
thank you, general.  but there's a price on my head.  if i don't pay off jabba the hutt, i'm a walking dead man.
oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
what are they for?
you and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
now, karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? you're welcome to keep on stayin here. it's workin' out real good.
yeah.
you'll need to recultivate that virus.
ready? the sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army -- which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes.  up a dime.
well?
why?
better re-load it.
i have so much to tell you.
i will. i will. we still have another day.
[within] juliet!
some folks take that natural stuff too far.
don't worry!  the kids will love it --
an existentialist.
who d'ya think you're foolin'?  i know you better than you think...
i don't want to put on some make up ...
no-
nice to have you here.
no, sir.
where do i charter a boat?
but 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. what do they mean?
what did you say?
why don't we take oxygen?
what can i do?  what can i do? you're getting me hysterical.
thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
do you want a beer or not?
yeah...i guess.
the family that steals together, deals together...
let me earn my keep. i'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. try to make him some cow tea next time.
hello?
who, for instance?
i don't know anymore. i thought i was, but obviously i was wrong.
his mother's side.
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
it's alright. let me see.
oh, mother shut up!  don't you understand? the water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. half the people on this ship are going to die.
precisely, my darling.  your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
ya hear me? you bust that crapper and i'll beat your ass.
whatcha looking in there for? we can't afford any of that.
in and out.  yes.  and mama... and mama, is not your real mama, is she franklin?
...that's right...
403 41st street, kids: home.
hello.
better'n me?
that was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  he's loose.  he's out of control.  it's very clear what needs to happen.  i have work to do.
they never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  what if breuning and carlisle took them from the evidence room?  couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
sign here please.
nussing!
yah? well, what now, d'ya think?
i didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
yeah, it did take me a long time.
millie, please.  i don't have a son. i think you better leave now young man. buzz gestures towards the front door.
oh, no!  not tonight, josephine!
it's fine.
is this the place?
yes.
i mean body temperature. do you have a fever?
oh dear god. its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
wilson— yeah—  yeah— i fought wilson.
not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... even kissing someone with aids is safe. but it there's something in your past you're worried about...
... what were you saying, admiral? something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
36 hours. they've already sailed from the persian gulf.
what kind?
... just call me when you have it.  ike, how is the story coming?  is she a man-eater?
yes, aren't you?
the hell i can't!  we get in there and we can stop him.
what the hell.  what is this?  a joke?
i'm not.
it is. you got yourself on tv again.
this letter was addressed to superman care of me.
you know what i mean. this car -- and you. nobody walks around like that. milk?
i'll knit you a sweater.
you're dying here.  don't you see that?!
i can't take this, sailor. she's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
what is it. tammy?
a grandmother. god bless you.
it's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
what?
i'm sorry.
she's beautiful.
for whom else have you worked?
stop this.  it's not true...
tell the other person how you feel.
i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts.
sad, huh? she's been here six months. her name's tiffany.
oh! madam is cancelling the engagement. madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. the house is jammed to the roof.
maybe. you want to play?
this is the shell.  what about the gun?
there!  look!
i didn't curse. i said 'frickin' head'.
ugh!
the left.  it's more natural.  hey, i've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  what would that be made of?
where are you going?
there's people up here!
every one of those times i was being supportive.  something you won't understand.
what do you want to know?
the pages are gone. that's real.
there's still a way.
i heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
i was drying out.
how's your uncle?  i hardly ever see him anymore.
yeah.
... showers followed by sunny periods.
where is it?
bobby didn't give you this?
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
we made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
i can't....
i can't go out like this.
darcy. benny's little sister.
is he serious?
sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel.
but...we bury the heads. oh. god! it must be torture for them!
that could be anybody's.
and the money?
inspector halloran.  homicide. you were supposed to contact a peter kurten?
at least it's not another 4-h meeting or a big brother barbecue.
nobody really changes at summer camp. they merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  you can't be helped, wichita. i'm not sure you can be punished, either. but let's find out...
i believe in heaven.  you people believe in heaven?
i've seen the same.  i'm not the country hick you seem to think i am.
wow.  do a puppet show for me, craig honey.
i hate that thing.
it's no meteor, that's for sure!
who is this?
great!
haven't i? to the airport, if you could.
i hate that thing.
no -- not at all.
the napkin will keep.  i'd rather not be alone.
deal.
oh, yes, of course. how do you do?
hi, private eye guy!
you were out at sea! hey, guess what? i graduated. i got my degree.
yes. according to the geneva convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
that's right!  tell him, so i can read it in hunsecker's column first!
then you'll have to make your own home. lots of people do.
then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
okay then. here's the scoop.
why can't you cancel it?
sorry.
i have to.
fuck you, mr. whatever-your-name is. this is a lifestyle i embrace.
so is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
poker!
no, no... not that kind of... underground. more a private... business. private.
what are you doing there?
i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.
i got it!  everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
how have you ... ?
but i -- well, you see, sir, i met mrs. marsh and told her.
i've never even met admiral kirk --
what now?
say that again, son.
will you live here?
let's get out of here. we got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where i do not know, but i know it's gonna be long.
what were you doing there?
your home address. oh, just the town will do.
i'll be fine... are you a writer, mr fink?
the nocturnal flying mammal?
until dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. that mass infection would make us a slave race.
uh-huh.  tell me what you think of this first.
... sex.
good. i want to talk to you.
--his name's von teer! his daughter's named domini!--
a strange wang right in my palm.
mr. gower! mr. gower! this is george bailey! don't you know me?
where have you been the last few weeks?
say steve, where's your manners?  here's mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? want some bourbon?
i talked to her two days ago.
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
good. i called you at work today. they said you were home sick.
do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
i don't want a bodyguard. i want the man i fell in love with.
all of you!
i want something i can print!
yeah, but i didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  what are you trying to prove?
why memphis?
yes... i did.
keep talking!
what would you say to a short one? bourbon still your drink?
you were there?
oh
is he related to the witness?
we're mortgaged to the eyeballs, truman. there's the car payments.  are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
would you, really? how sweet-
what about them?
i don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
yes?
i had to get up anyway.
i traced her to a nursing home.  a young woman fitting simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
i went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, august 1, 1939, snow hill, alabama.  maybe i should be heroic more often.
and this is evil?  the guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
bravo, mr. fletcher.
...that was a dr. david gruber's office...
i'm not expecting anyone.
look, man, i know i owe you --
i'll show you how to tell what's going on. if things go south, you unplug me.
there must be another way!
which means i gotta fence it for two. who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
this'll do.
maybe someday.
you know mom, it's okay to have male friends. besides, it's over with me and charlie.
he says their medicine is that much more advanced.  he was very nice about it. but he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
nor will there be. my husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
how'd it go? did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
no.  they say his eligibility ran out years ago.
yeah, the lot's right there. my truck is right out back.
the earth just opens up and swallows people. 
read the early zionists on european jewry; they sound like goebbels.
geoffrey's not in cairo.  he's not actually a buffoon.  and the plane wasn't a wedding present. it belongs to the british government.  they want aerial maps of the whole north africa. so i think he's in ethiopia.  in case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in saddam anyway.  they flew the gunship up here to hide out.  when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
no need lie, boy.  i no hurt you. do i look like i wanna hurt you?
well?
your concern is heartwarming.
geez, i forgot how heavy these things are.
hear she's retarded.
you sound real remorseful.
that's it.  back to obedience school.
...where does kyo live?
santini will do that for 25 dollars!

why did that man want to kill him?
really.
alive and hale.  he's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  is your mother often this unstable?  penelope!
negatory.  <u>too many ants</u>.  and while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
do you believe me?
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
so tell me, tell me, i'm peeing in my pants.
well yes -- you know that about george.
is that your "expert opinion?" the only answer we've had out of you is "i don't know."
shut up, dumb-ass! you didn't score. i scored with both of them...
no more man. i'm about to drop as it is.
thank you.  why does he need you by him?
yes, sir.
i'm not armed.
we left three weeks ago, alonso. can't be that near.
please, jerry - that's no way to talk.  nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
we could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... please, it's time for us. come upstairs.
and does he kill people?
do you have to be so brutal?
we can get a job with another band. a male band.
it's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - the natives.
god told me, since i was his number- one fan, that i should make up new stories as if i was paul sheldon. so, went to town. and i bought a typewriter. and paper to type on. the same kind paul sheldon used. and i turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. would you like to see it?
i'm just tired.
i don't know why you boys are so good to me.
jake.  i thought you would be at work, dear.
nonsense.  you're a fey creature with mad ideas.  but you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
that ain't bad.
when?
right.
gee, charley, i'm sure glad you stopped by for me. i needed to talk to you. what's it they say about blood, it's— 
good.
fine. let's drop it.
...i-i... made some mistakes and i spent some money.
he was buttering her rolls. pumping her churn. splashing milk in her box.
cooley, i want to talk to you.
i know -- and i can't really explain that, but i have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
it's okay, eugene.
you don't know what it's like. herr mozart frightens me. he drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
feed store keeps up to five k in their safe. need me a good boy for back-up. even split. you interested?
are you running away?
why?

lloyd, what are you doing? that's jessica and... my mom.
"... and i said that"...
oh, get off that trapeze!  there's your story! smear it all over the front page -- earl williams caught by the morning post! and take all the credit -- i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now i'm getting out! i know i told you that twice before today -- but this time i mean it!
did i frighten you?
i... certainly, but-
for once in my life, i am not the issue.
there's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  this is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  now, with some of the s+m and bondage films, they straddle the line.  how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  rape films, but there aren't many.  i've never seen one.
is that good?
i'm sorry. that is not my business.
fucking great...you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
take the rope.
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.

i have to ask you for that key.

-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
i just don't like it.
two hours.
yer lucky i'm here at all. i tell you, jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
what what are you doing? we're cover!
yourself. good, bad, everything. just show me who you are for once.
i'm late for surgery.
blue, then.
look, bud, what's the idea? i live in a shack in potter's field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . and i ain't never seen you before in my life.
i know the answer.  i know all there is to know about louis.
i'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
you sure? that doesn't sound --
since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
dad... whatever i decide, will it be okay with you?
y'know, brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
let me tell you something about boys.  they're like weeds.  they grow best when they're ignored.
shoot, italian boys love them some black women.  they can't get enough of me.

bye, sweetie.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
all this apparatus, vicki... this house, and the money, and the power ... it was never mine. it was something i inherited. bruce wayne was something i inherited.  all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
but i've never forgotten you, elena!
i got caught up at work.
no.  laramie.  except i was born in cody. how did you know that?  oh, right, sure, i forgot: you know everything.
don't treat me like i'm stupid.  it pisses me off.
okay, explain.
"miss susan alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new chicago opera house in a performance of - of -"  i can't pronounce that name, mr. kane.

c-18.
yeah —- sure.
nobody's trading with anybody! look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! listen up mr. pink. we got two ways here, my way or the highway. and you can go down either of 'em. so what's it gonna be, mr. pink?
will you miss me?
from where?
i'm a witch. a white witch. why don't we move on?
not too well. he taught at the sorbonne, right? dad always calls him his "hippie brother". did some work with timothy leary i think, and - is he... is he going to die?
hollywood.  the alto nido apart- ments.
they didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
no, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
did you call anyone?
shut up!  just shut up, you idiot!!
well done, commander.
maybe. or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
shhh...
a party? mom's gonna kill you. then me.
married. once. same woman. all these years. she just slithered up the stairs.
how are you doing.
is that the technical description of what i've got?
looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton.
what do you mean?
thanks.
thank god for that.
mrs. leeman?
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way, beefy.
comstat did a psychosearch on him. used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. he hit the bottom of the curve.
wait.  i'll send a patrol with you.
do i wanna go to memphis and get married?
can i have one of your cigarettes?
a deer?
jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? impatient...
well, mom, he's the first to admit it.  he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice.
i'm not a kid.
there's something else which i know will appeal to you. a visit to the paris sewers. they tell me it is extremely instructive.
ha ha ha! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! ha ha ha!!
you – must – open – me – up – again?
give it up, evelda.
now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious...
what do you think? custard or cheesecake?
yearse!
what is it?  what's going on?  where are we?
let me...
while they're strung out?
you want mine, too?  you take his, you take mine.  i'm the one fucked it up...
no, monsieur varlac, my warrant is only for you.  now, will you please come down at once.  you will be taken back to chalon for trial.
can i come?
he's gotta be a nut!  he saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
i've offered you some warm broth. i thought perhaps-
even data?
just what i told you.
i don't know. i just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
ted, you're overworked.  you've been flying yourself into the ground.
now, look, john. here's the speech. it's in caps and double-spaced. you won't have any trouble reading it. not nervous, are you?
is that real enough for you?
you're calling me on your cell phone, right?
it's okay, really.
i'm the creator.
my grandmother's ear-muffs.
legume? you mean, a vegetable?
i gotta go, baby. i love you. tell mommy i called. you be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
try wednesday.
the m.e.'s report stated that marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
i always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  twelve in fact. twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  did you have sex with her?
who do you think i am?  one of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "threaten you"?  you and i just living will always be a threat.  forever.  look at your life, major.  look at mine.  nothing there but threat.  threats and nothingness. it's what we live for.
from other people!  i believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
do you recall the school motto?
only flowers i wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
what are you afraid will happen?
a mass for the dead.
madeleine --
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months. it seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
i'm sure i'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
we write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
this is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
where are they? do you see them?
...oh, yeah-right. i ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
no.
what do you think?
i don't know.
hey, ya like it? open it... yah -- the globe. pull at the equator there.
how can we thank you, commander. you- you have saved our people.
what do you-?
it's better to split up, to increase our chances. we must change hiding places, and change them continually ... in the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
who are you calling?
hey, it's you.
one hunnert's the best we can do here.
i was a clerk's apprentice on saint croix.  but, then i went to king's college.
what are you doing here, i thought you were a nazi.
what are you talking about?
listen to me, patrick. i'm leaving.
as long as they're dead...
here's my number if you need it...  when can you start?
terrible boring.
... because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.  well, i am not a crook.  i have never made a dime from public service ...
a "complimentary corsage."
and what makes you so tough?
first, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which i would like to have returned to me.
i don't care about luck, you understand me? it ain't that.
after i called in, i had a chance to sit down with the three locals. they swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... it might be alive.
hey, lenny.  we made it.
we got different information.
what's the difference? the noise'll kill you first.
i'd be there for him.
what're you doing?
i don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
beer please! do you want another drink?
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...
get the... midnight... express.
i don't like anything else.
come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on max's head?
it's on.
[the most important thing in life is family. and there you are. you have my family. what do you want?]
catherine says you don't like her.
that's it?
you scared the shit out of me, man. you were dead for fifteen seconds. totally flatlined.
yeah, that really hit the spot.
that's the third time. i better call the office.  would you relax, please?
got to think this through ...
yes!
i want my fucking money --
rose, can't i see what the nipple on it is like?
what are you thinking?  we were only supposed to scare him!
oh, oh, no, i can't-i can't eat this. i'm nauseous.  if you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know i-i have to go out to burbank... and give out an award on a tv show.
really?
figured it out yet?
west?
"it?"
why?
just thought i'd...
i have to tell you something...
neither.
well...
yes, uh...
lots of places.  the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.
jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
what are we talking about?
the people want you made dalai lama.
colonel kurtz, i guess.
constanzia.  we expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
and like she said, do it before the parade.
control tower, reading, sir.
things change, kundun.
don't kid me. i'm in no mood for it.
stop. what about maserati boy?
i don't really have any problems.
so what?  this victim...
wait a minute. all right. hold on.
thanks are hardly necessary.
no, hawkeye just said it all.
i thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
call 'em here -- ?
yeah. you?
you know i need to use you.
you sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
he'll be back.  what would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
look.  i found it.  isn't that it?  cyber dynamics corporation?
what's going on....what are you doing?
make it my first born.
and it's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. i guess i'm not the girl i thought i was.
you have your father's style.  you've done very well.
mom, i mean dad...
...and i said, shut up!
he's just mentally retarded, i guess.
oh please sod off.
let myrna finish.
howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
mack must think zero has a police band.
anybody can have a bad day!
why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
don't try to talk --
then how come it worked loose?
sally, calm down.  we're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
what is this?
let me introduce you. mr.  killaine, mrs. west.
hi, byron.
steady it out!
rache says i have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  i told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
here you must be in proper attire.

$500.  he borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.

mr. morton's with american express... he's...  i can tell jim what you do...?
i got what i fucking deserved.  i had it all.  i could've kept going!
my job.
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille's manners.

two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
hey, i want ya out instamaticly. -- i'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- go out -- live! do, enjoy life.
like to get this position.  did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
you wouldn't understand.  seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
so how 'bout it, mr. selznick, do i make my deal with bo? or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
yeah.
i love you.
yes, perfect.  as a matter of fact, i ran into simone on the lot the other day.

mcginty's.
i'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.

lila?
how do you know?

i'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, i suppose?
i've seen it. it's all pain.
you're hurt --
well, does everybody love us now? you've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
me too.  bye now.
he said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  her name's anna. but she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
i wonder if i hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
yeah, hon. real bad. you just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila, so i'm gonna play blue-face with you. 
let's go.  time to move out.
faster than cricket?
well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
enough of that crap.
i'd like you to have them.
aw, come on, hooker, why don't you just...
yes, i know.
how was russia?
that makes his birth sign... virgo! why that's the sign of a little girl!  can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with emperor commodus?
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that's back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i don't know if they still around, but i don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
zero... c'mon, dan i don't have all day.

eddie dowd.
i'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
may i please be excused?
every ship but the four you sent.
"...where's my pill..."
it's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
you heard what abbott said?
that's very gracious of you, quince.
who's the other woman?
i don't even know what i'm looking for!
i saw the smile -- good piece.

mr. spock, what would v'ger need to fulfill itself?
you need new girdles.
don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
pardon?
maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe.  it could be to humiliate them. just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
and it's called...?
fat sam left the beach today. so did gummy. it began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe i should be aware of.
well, you'd have to keep it under control.

i need the name and address of the owner of a toyota corolla, license number me31704... we didn't get the last digit so i need the ten possible matches.
i'm not listening.

good samba dancing...?
you did not just say "injuns," del.
i'm not here to make you feel bad.  i'm here for vindication.  in my heart...
nothing. just the cyclist. he's passed us.
some people who went by this way lost it.  two men and some women. they packed their stuff on horses and went on.
all right.  then what?
-- you're not making sense!! what "scarecrow"?
that's all you got, three girls?
oh god ...
what is it, d'artagnan?  assassins falling from the sky now?
mr. sheldrake?
look at that fucking phony, dude! pretending to be a fucking millionaire!

i disguised myself as an alabama state trooper and penetrated the fbi ncic.
what are you going you doing?
was he cheated?
oh my god, are you alright?
hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
he's a jerk. i never noticed it before. seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . .  . . . maybe you think the same thing about me. that's why you keep avoiding me.
hey, guys...
yes. i like to watch.
it's the latest thing, mrs. peel.
exactly what are you a doctor of, mr. venkman?
i've heard about you for ages! i thought you must be an old man.
so you're talking to me?
you like bourbon?
maybe we don't have to.  it's trapped in there.  we could just leave it in there all the way back to irth.
no, i'm not...
i checked the medical database.  no one else is even close.
hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  i am.  this is vivian.  you two been together long?  you and edward?
their minds are so.... they move in strange directions....
he wants us.
...me?
john, john.  john, you're still building onto that flea circus, that illusion.  and now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  that's the illusion.
let her be, son. she'll do all right. you better get yourself straightened out.
but you took off your captain kidd uniform.
max won't let me drive jess to dance anymore.
it wasn't about getting laid.  i just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
... and then i opened the door again but it was gone.  there was nothing there.
i need a ticket.
...rooms with her.  our relationship is normal, conforming.  we share nothing but space.  what is she doing to...
it's over now.
excuse me, are you erin brockovich?
i would have stayed there if i could.
mrs. porter is not taking her husband's death well.
-- and even if i do learn to read, what use'll it be? i'm goin' to live on a ranch!
i have illegitimate children.
we can hardly make a profit with them.  up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- they're mocking us, elaine. we're at their mercy.  we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  we used to decide who would play what role. we told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  when they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
didn't think i could.
jewish girls like to give head, right?
yes, please.  you said he gave a name...
that's because i never had sex with him!
what?
no. that was higgins ....
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar.
...hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then i felt badly, so i--
why?
it'll never wash.  pardoning them means we're guilty.  the people, the press will go nuts.
you on your way home?
i pray you: be succinct.
walk away.
alex?
hey, what about sunday dinner? when're you gonna let me know?
chicago.
i should go with her, sandy.
you'll find out.

that doesn't bother you, does it?
and you had sex with all of these men in cars? only in cars?
and keep only forty-percent?  no thanks.
no doubt, sir. but i am endowed with talent, and you with money. if i offer mine, you should offer yours.
yeah!
tell six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
that the problem, son?  you slow?
my old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
tell them!  tell them!
what are you doing here?
nothing. i dunno--
what's in it for you?
you can't prove a rumor. that's why it's a rumor.
what limes?
yes.  starting with a screw.  now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what i'm doing here, but...
it's not our affair.  even if wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
itís extremely important to my investigation...
barker.  jock barker?
out of the mouths of babes, louis.
this is different.
my momma says every house is two houses. every street, two streets.  there's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  the city of the dead.
i've got heads here, norman.
just, just take it easy, walter.
hello, guys.
not on your life.  that's it. i've had it with crap around this house.  from now on, no more pizza!  get it?  starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
he's not what i expected, sir.
...tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and big john, it'll lead network news.  okay so far?
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew.  what was i supposed to do?
magda's right, i'm so lucky to have you in my life.
you told antonucci that shit came from me.
no!
range twenty meters.
i...what?  are you, are you, that's why...?  are you nuts?  i'm...i'm going to close for you, i'm going to...  here, here, i'm going to make this office...i'm going to be back there number one...hey, hey, hey!  this is only the beginning...list...list... listen. listen.  just one moment. list...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  twenty percent. i'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  twenty percent.  for as long as i am with the firm.  fifty percent.  you're going to be my partner.  fifty percent.  of all my sales.
refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, fletch.
i'm already hurting.
look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than i do.
well, i don't know... i only been seeing you --
mr. deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. it is, to say the least, most uncommon.
goin' out with these clowns for a while.
i was giving him some advice is all. preparing him for life.  you don't want him to grow up soft, ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
you're not jealous, are you? you have to understand... helen and i had this strange, intense... experience together.
maybe i'm just fucking curious.
what...?
i tell you, it was so wonderful. i felt like a little boy. i saw paradise, jezzie.
this is --
i finally got through to sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the grand jury about haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the grand jury asked him the goddamn question.
in the first place, i don't fall in love with weirdos i've only known for four or five days.
um --
jesus! they're all gonna be calling me!
we've gone insane.
no, i saw a guy shooting from over there.  he was behind that fence. what are you going to do about it?
what do you actually know with religion?
well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. and some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
at least we're rid of the damn monster.  it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
at this hour?
i'm sorry, i did my best, i thought the certificates would save us all.
okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
this looks to me like a good sign. don't you think so? as far as i'm concerned, anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. why... as a matter of fact, i remember when i was in china, many years ago, i happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an english woman, the wife of ambassador shafford, a good friend of mine. there, too, we found a bible... and i said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. why, it was logical, i said, that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore...  no? you don't believe it? well, as a matter of fact, i was right... the woman was found two days later. it was a case of amnesia.
fair enough. what'll we talk about at dinner?
you really think i look sexy in this smock?
look i-i-i'll be okay.  i'll be okay.
you're fuckin right you're not. how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
just put it in your purse.
what?  what?
this is real, bananahead!
yeah. my stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. maybe we can find a place there to talk.
hey... you okay?
it does help.  dorothy, you're waking up!
we caught 'em.
am i dead, louis?  am i dead?
i've got the heading, major.  one-three-eight.
why?
you okay?
no, just that one word -- zuul -- but i have no idea what it means.
detective carter from the haddonfield p.d.
it's going to be closer.  you better get going.
i can't lean on faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
and if the teeth aren't suzie's?  you'll give this up?
my employer wishes to remain anonymous.
captain, im sorry.  i know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
thirty?
i don't need camels.
you always suspected she'd fled to the west.
yes?
goddammit, rae!
frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. do you know about that?
doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  i'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  what's your status?
maybe you should take this.
yeah.
all i'm saying is we have to be careful. we can't get caught.
no, i didn't know.  is he dead?
that's not wh...
what are my choices?
soda.  you got any soda?
what would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
you want something?
did you talk to paul?
not in my world.
i think that we should stop going out on dates.
you thinking what i'm thinking?
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse? why can't they just give it to me now?
fuck you.
this is the right day.
don't scream.
i warned you about playing that shit when i'm in the car.
no...nooooooo...shoot me! shoot me! shooooooooot meeeeeeeee!!!
are you a warrior?
good. i'll show you how, apey.
but you don't believe it.
that wouldn't be too good, would it?
what are we doing?  ray, i was ready to kill you.
i have a family.
i've done nothing and for that i am ashamed.
great!
sorry 'bout that.  so queens, you psyched for the series?
no what?
ah. one of the supporting characters.
shit, shit, shit...
shut the fuck up and do what i say!
new dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  you can change!
say something ...
sex?! he's a man! we wrestled!
do you know what his budget was?
the inside man?
me?
who are all these people?
no problem, rick.  come over and meet a former resident here, tommy jarvis.  he's got some kinda prank going about...
sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... you seem like an entirely different person ...
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. in exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
do you know i turned down "frankenstein"?
do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
why?
let's get him over to the bed.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
i know it! but they've got nothing to do with this case! do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we're going to lose 'em?
if i go.
good god.  what was that?
the door jam, miss teschmacher. this ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. so he grabs something from the table...
gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
shhhh...!
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i'm up?... when was the last time you wore pink? when was the last time you drank soup standing up? final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
oh you bet.  will you excuse me for a sec?
oh for chrissakes...  "white trash betty."  i didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered safeway.
i know better than you what people will say when they have to.  when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day.
nonsense.
that's where we can help you.  with kat.
hey, sweet cheeks.
skinny?
thanks.
you should know, when i come back here with the mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the prc.
all right, jim.  you said i was running this show, right? you said no decisions without my approval, right?  well what the hell is this? what's going on, jim?
they botched the execution.
fail safe in lock. four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. this is sergeant pinback calling bomb #20. do you read me, bomb?
look how full of yourself you are.
i was in luh-love with her.
what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when i gamble, i prefer to gamble on force.
excuse me? do i know you, friend? take a look around you. do you even know who i am?
forgive me for askin', son, and i don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
it makes sense. i mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
what i say is, no. we don't do partners.
...where is my pill?
i'll take the south end -
ted! do something!
rudolfo, you dirty pig!  pull over.
jesus christ, it's a fucking dog!
it's you.
merlin, will i live...?  ...i was dreaming...
what do you think of me?
i think, he's really nice... he's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
serious stuff...
it's game time.
erik. you don't understand.
what?
i told you all along. you see, you were wrong about mr. sheldrake.
what's that?
-- burn them.
know, but—
page 87.
the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over both our lives if we let him.
i was only checkin' it for you. thought maybe somethin' was bent.
g'day, they say it's worth three grand...
for what purpose?
you're one to talk, lex. your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
so you watching pearl jam on mtv tonight?
i didn't know where she was going to lead you.
hope you like it. feel free to stop reading at any time. i'll take no offense.
oh shut up.  craig, darling are you in there?
it is today?
will you let me go then?
whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
what did he say?
yeah. everybody's talkin' about it. they're makin' a big deal out of it.
pinkus.
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
i don't see how i can, and i can't prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
why did you leave?
good morning, my lord!
i know how to tag a damn conch....
what the hell is plan-r?
all right then, if i have to go to school then i'd better go.
my darling, eugenie, dainty morsel! get on your back! let's try it dorsal!
who knows?... another one has it that she entered a store in troina. this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i don't know what in his store... at troina.
it's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
why? i mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
mr. lipnik, i really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
i know she's coming back.
phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... i gotta...
you would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
i'm a doctor.
why -- charlie put it there to kill --
yup, that's him, that's the guy. you know what else the little creep did? he kept files, close on 250,000 files. and you know what's in those files?
why do i tell you this?  i never told david.  i never even remembered it until you got me going.
you know, dave -- it is dave, isn't it?  i can't keep all of this a secret.
i know.
that's the breed...course it might take time.
be careful!
what happened?
hiya, norm. how ya doin', margie? how's the fricassee?
what're you -- what?
who is machine?
am i in trouble or something?
why?
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
no, no.  you boys are tired.
yes.  it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. do you know what that means?
don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- someone's been talking to harvey dent.
i'm going to miss you.
looks like a chipmunk.
there's no way to practice this. and no time. besides, i've planned it all. there aren't any surprises.
little.
so what's that supposed to mean?
that woman --
face it. with some guys you have to make the first move. a lot of guys are just... wussies.
oh, get it over with.
with what?
you're very brave, louis.  good luck.
what?
well it's about time. looks like you found yourself a helper too.
nothing.
you've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
you feelin' sick?
her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
will you come with me?
what are you guys doing?
primary circuit is live.
eve, she strangled a baby!
let him do it! go-go-go-go-go!
how do you know it's for us?
contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
oh, jesus.
yah - how are you doon?
oh, make that uniform blue.
i'm not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
wrong.
yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
oh, yeah?
they usually tell me.
what honey?
that's history, fletch. you owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
i don't follow you.
miz lampert, ma'am...
they're close.  let me make a call.  you can see they're okay.
who was kay seeing besides randy stetz?
it's just that when i'm in this genre, i tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
no. i'm all alone.
headache, huh? too much sun, i guess. you want to come in?  still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
your earrings?
about the ship...
where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
she doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
you should get the order you want.
jesus.
it will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
can't you stop these things?!
pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. for example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. you know the story, same thing here. same principle, i mean.
scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. you came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. but i didn't even know what happened... 'til i heard it on the news the next morning.
you asked my opinion, sir.
the one you work with. who is he? how do you do it?
you're very perceptive.
he's an imbecile.  i tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
he gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
three weeks. i had to rent some equipment.
i have to go, bill -- it's been a helluva day.  need a few minutes to sort everything out.
pattycake!  pattycake!
she's not a little girl any more.
the supernatural! the powers of darkness! it's all true. take your own life! suicide, david. join me.
what... you mean "got into bed with" them?
who?
i'm a salesman.
oh my god!  sorry.
i mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  i love this time of day.
harry? oh harry, i knew you'd come. i love you, harry. i love... take me home, harry.
so, what are you going to do?
what?
why should <u>you</u> care?
hear about ice?
i mean, do you have something i could show my manager? i mean, do you have a reel?
you live here?  ... we don't have any record of that.
will you hear "last post", sir?
reward?
i am...
all i saw was the headlights. the high beams were on.
are you staying with a friend, sir?
like korben, can i have 30 seconds of your time here?
shit.
naw.
'one hundred prayers' could be the page number. the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. but what book?
...she has a <u>home</u>...
my dear caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  he cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees -- and i'm afraid that is what it has come to.
she's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  has he brought it back on course yet?
no... i want to stay with you...
he's on the telephone.
i won't wait until tuesday.  i'll break your arms right now.
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses.
well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right.
could you drive me somewhere?
this wire came while you were gone. your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
you love me now, don't you?
i realize.  maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
what does that mean?
the truth is, i haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
mission hospital? gimme the receiving room.
daniel, just forget argon.  let's get out of here.  we'll find another way to stop the waste.
this is just an informal discussion.
you didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
really? what is it he's writing?
it's an integer proof.
how many?
we are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
nobody? huh!... how come?
it's because of jacqueline —— i can't go on looking for her --
everything all right out there, tom?
the whole wing's devoted ot this program.  that's your office.
fucking desert.
bullshit. i see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. i know exactly what you're doing. empty your pockets.
expecting visitors?
you buy furniture.  you tell yourself: this is the last sofa i'll ever need.  no matter what else happens, i've got the sofa issue handled.  then, the right set of dishes.  the right dinette.
because that would mean they gave you mine.
their what?
so sue me.
i believe you.
how you doing?
by her own hand.  there are many such stories.
french.
how's your brother?
page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if i'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
come on, it works.
the world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  look, why not make yourself useful? i'm just about out of smokes.  go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias. 
what did she do to you?
how could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
uh... attention, attention! we're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
your future lies with us, skywalker. now you will embrace the dark side. obi-wan knew this to be true.
ready sir.
i have to see you.
the doctor said not to give you anything. you can see him in the morning.
wait a minute! i need you.
... it's not just from tonight.  i've known you for a long time.  i see you come out of work every day.  i walk with you to lunch.  i know what you order... i see you buy baby ruths before going back in...  i know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... i know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and i love you.   i love you.  i think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and i would be knocked out several times if i even got just a first kiss.  but i'll be back in the morning.  and i won't be distant.  and i will call if you let me... but i still don't drink coffee.
your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your mother's still sleeping.
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity.
i'm ready spock. let's go find george and gracie...
are you all squeaky clean now?
if there's gold.  if!
toh-pak-cha=8a 
it is not necessary to understand. we are leaving and i am thankful.
is there going to be a later...?
productive. so they're closing down the school?
why?
hay—in my teeth.
i'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
this promise isn't subject to congressional approval.
...you know...
what?
what are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
... what's happening to him?'
damn it!
this has been quite a night. here's a thought. why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
one question. do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
how much?
great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
there's no child here, and no dogs either.
rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
i'll tell you why. because when i was little, i had a fat cousin, cousin luke. and he used to make fun of the handicapped. and one day he had a bad stomachache. so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off.
do you think you could do something, sidney?
next plane's not coming 'til next monday.
jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
hard to say.
i do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but i hold no prisoners-of-war.
attractive buttons, yes?  but yank one off, toss it, and poof!  it emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
a big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
what...?
no it doesn't. i see right through you.
we're cool.
what was that about?
no, no, we just got her back together...
when was the last time you had a girlfriend?
elaine, it's wednesday.
you went to the room to help with the birth.
nash.
i am raymond.     thank you for allowing us to stay here.
you come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  and they start putting things in your arm... you know.  how do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
you ok? that stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
what do you want?
intelligent question, nels.  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
you ever had to open it up like that before?
are you dr. louis judd?
aah!
who's that then?
fuck you too, you rotten whore!!
upstairs. johnny cammareri showed up last night.
hi.
what?  that's horrible!
i need you to stake me. i can't do it without it. it's just a couple hundred grand. taken out of our cut when we're done.
no.  i graduated from george washington university.  then i entered the agency training program.
yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
alright.
fair.
peter...
what was what?
i'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, mrs. otto, but the walkers said you would understand.  i know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
hey, hot stuff. you're still on the clock...
and didn't the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
buddy... does rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
huh?!  oh, uh, no, i didn't get the job. but something <u>better</u> happened!
how are you going to find him?
momma... are they angry with us.
you did good, kay-em. i'm proud of you.
you guessed it. the card's phony. i got plenty of 'em. different names, different jobs. i work out of san francisco. go anywhere, do anything. all it takes is the folding.
what kind of gun is that?
well enough. i have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
whadaya mean?
i'll be damned.
no. you're not.
if i tell you where llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
hi. this is jack.
is -- is anna -- who i think it is?
thank you for correcting my ignorance.  i'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  i feel we make a good team.
but they're using you!
i don't believe you.
i didn't sleep.  they're giving me less and less air time.  they don't think i'm at all anchor material.
she's calling the shots now.
when you threw it in, what did you see?
nothing.
roy, that's fine, but i don't have time for this. bobo --
alan?  where are we going?  you see something?
will you?
don't tell me he's "busy".  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
i never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
what you having, jack?
why do you want to stop?
that's nice. what'd you tell him?
what we want to know about is manchester.
there goes another of your disciples.
maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
no, she's all right. she's still here. but i'll get her home soon.
well, look who's here...
papa, can't i leave now? there's a meeting of the junior shop stewards ...
i'm going to have a baby.   michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  diedre mayfair curry. pretty, huh...?  funny --- i never really thought i'd ever ---
hejira.
you wanna release your air tanks?
we do know that.
hey.
you alright?
... yeah...
he who is not with us is against us.
busy. but you've got his heart.
where do i find you?
mom?  eve and i have to go.
where... where am i?
come on, barney, you and me live in the real world.  you don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, mr. thomas.
wow.
not right now, jerry.
will he be supervised?
come on then.
... chauncey... last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
<i>$300,000.</i>
i get my hostage first.  no one's turned loose until i say so.
we have a treaty with austria.
he's a great poet.
where's everybody?
good day to you, sir.
but not tonight.
what did you wish for, honey?
but now you're telling us now you do.
you do everything yorgi says?
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra...
i seem to be out of gas.
wait a minute, charlie. this should belong to the club.
i'm trying to find a style of my own.  do you really like them?
way to not overthink it.  so when do we leave?
look, it's three am.  these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  you better start cutting them some slack.
you really do hear a lot, don't you?
yes.
no. i baked them for you.
can a vampire feel love?
i don't know.
you seem surprised. could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  you needn’t worry. it seems his motives were pure. from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
listen, john, i've got to go. t boone pickens just walked in...  just joking...  no don't tip the owner of the salon. okay, john, right, got it.  sorry about that.
they're just simple tests, nan. we'll both be right here.
didn't he tell you what you wanted?
come on in.  how about a gin and tonic?
will you marry me?
please, man, i'm suffocating in here.
he had to make a phone call.
i'm not hungry, oddly.
hello.
oh, i'd give anything to get out of oz altogether -- but which is the way back to kansas?  i can't go the way i came.
howdy, jake. what's going on here?
couldn't sleep. kinda wanted to talk to you. do you mind?
it doesn't matter...he's next to you.  you know, i always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. why didn't you?
oh... i'm sorry i have to rush but i've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... tell me exactly how it all turned out.
then we're rich. we're damn, filthy stinking rich.
you see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but i prefer this!
you have a problem with gays, joe.
you're really gonna pop the question?
the same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
hey, slinky?
congratulations, ensign mayo, sir!
the university cannot do this. is the room safe?
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. i handed it to him on a silver platter. i told my father and those people...
they're migrants.
no, i seriously doubt that pony's gonna be in a limo.
it takes all types.
yes...if you like big hair...
nurses.
do you think you're ready?
just took a guess is all... you in or out on this deal?
so, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
what name is he using?
you have two murders to investigate. this man's head was beaten in. and there's nothing in his pockets.
she told us about one.  the little sisters of the moonlight.  in las vegas.
what is that?
i don't want to know how to say that though.  i want to know useful things. like where the good stores are.  how much does champagne cost?  stuff like chat.  i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? indicates no. moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
well, i'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
you'd say anything to keep me away from her.  to keep her for yourself.
you don't find that repugnant?
maybe they're all protecting the species. maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
in the shoreland hotel. and our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
now what is up with <i>that</i>?
botox. christ. we had aspirations when we were in college.
your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew i wasn't ready for no marriage.
are you open?
the boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
we can crush gaius another way. what if you do throw something to the people they really want?  make them a gift of food.
so am i.
ellie, it was a formal party...
come on dorothy.
now how could anybody guess that? they had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "grand central or bust!"?
now, or he dies, please.
jordan.  i always hoped we'd get together -- though just now i'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
rinaldi... rinaldi...  what region do you come from?
... what's your name again?
hey mike, what can i say?
hey, that's the guy-
hurry the fuck up!
you gotta do this for me. i'm in here because of you.
it's not a game.  something you play.
among other things... we know convergence is the real super-highway: all the pc's, tv's, phones, etc. linked together. why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
why, that's ridiculous! they're responsible for everything that—
you wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in india, do you?
funniest thing, captain. there wasn't anything wrong with my implants. there was something right with my eyes. when doctor crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
well... okay. i would like you to help me find a...wife.
sophie... is walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, i'll tell you. wait in the office for two hours. if you don't hear from me, you and duffy meet me at 1712 alameda.
too low.
you got plenty of money?
you better get some sleep.
what is she saying?
it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed. i'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
was jack goodman your good friend?
no.
what are you two talking about?
sam, ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot.
the happy hunting ground.  who cares?
i said i was sorry.
funny, you don't look hip. 
between your book sales and this tv thing, there's going to be no living with you.  and let me guess, you boiled god down to a conceit.
you've heard enough.  decide. are you going to release me?
create a little drama?  start a new rumor?  what?
you -
no, man. hey. no, you know what? hey, it's you, man. it's, you know what, you know what it is? it's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. it's this cell. it's this void, you know.
hi.
you'll probably have them the rest of your life.
seems you were the last to see carlton alive. and the last to see gregory alive.
you've got a lot of fucking gall.  thirty nine.
what did she say about me?
no shit.
three degrees off the comets trajectory!
marvin says that rex's will is four years old. he never redrafted it.
what's that?
i'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
because he was cruel?
i don't find this very funny,
look, mister...
what if he doesn't show up? what if he's taking a nap?
so.  you're a soldier. fighting for whom?
don't get too excited, fuzzy.
oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  but you couldn't approach them.  they were a wise bunch of birds.
i think i have the necessary papers. is there a ladies room...
pills... you know how i feel about pills.
i'm sure cort and sissy are back in their cabins.  so you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
spunky. he told you about that?
'been up north?
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
*                     cbs said they'll give us four minutes.  they thought the russian was a nice touch.
...you ride winston.
look, i thought we were all right on this, maura.  it's over.  you know that.
claudia - don't -
perfect, my ass!  --you pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  then richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything i spent a year planning. --frankly, i'm amazed is worked.
yeah?
beg pardon?
that was lovely!
what? steve seemed to put up with warren.
my wife.
i think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your dad?
jen, listen ...
yeah.
no.
that is so--weird that you name your car.
then why have i become a man like you?
i do.
what does that mean?
what do herbs have to do with it? i don't understand the --
yes, probably... maybe...
what are the chances busting out of here?
lemme tell you something.  vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  nobody even know what he looked like until now...
if i break one you gonna shoot me?
then i'm crazy.
ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  i mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. you won't be publishing.  you won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
our mister <u>frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
yes you can.
we made it?
send him home.  you don't want him to see it.
we'll take a rain check.
he said he'd try. try is like maybe. try is nothing!
egg. one egg—doughnuts—black coffee. that's your ration till lunch. any complaints?
i don't trust him.
mom, please?
say it, goddamn it!
you mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
i remember once when your account checked.
i better give you my address then.
why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
i like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
the next trip, when i come with all the money, it'll look like i hand it to the same one i did before...
steve, dear, please forget all of this.  what can it matter after tomorrow?
you shouldn't have.
alex.
good idea, crabs. only one problem. i don't know where they live.
the theatre?
that'd be my guess.
good afternoon, mr. harris.
demons, jacob? why demons? are you writing ... ?
yes. so i've noticed. jerry's noticed -— he'll come up with something.
what do you suggest?
open?
hi.  i'm todd aubochon.
for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
but first i gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
just one.  the bar's closed.
right now, curly. it can't wait.
where'd he go?
you don't need me. i wouldn't be useful to you anymore, jack.
i know a party we could go to...
this is good.
there's somethin' wrong about it, mother.
dancing with you.
nothing... i should never have left him...
what's that? oh!  who gave you this? how much is it? wolfi, who gave you this?
are you staying at the hotel?
look in my pack.
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? there must be something.
john couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  he was a fine man despite his problems --
wanna go for a swim?
hope with none of my girl friends.
i'm sorry. they're not used to seeing a car like this.
all right, love ya ma. listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
no thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  if you try that at msu this saturday, i'm pretending i don't know you.
the duke?  what did you do?
sorry.
why are you inventing problems?  you two are a couple of goddam clones.  you look so right together, i want to double my fee.
how can you say that you 'admire' them?
shut up. i like the kid.  remember the night he took farella at st. nick's, charley. we won a bundle. real tough. a big try.
have you decided?
<u>stop</u>...
just give me one chance.  if you don't like me after tonight, i'll stay away forever.
what?
you going to call the police?
does doug care that you're seventeen?
this isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
well...no, but --
fish.
well, i don't really listen to her when it comes to men. i mean, look at john, for crissake. oh, you went to school with him didn't you? you're probably friends or something.
you should play with much larger tennis balls. so how's alan?
why did we begin this?
<u>we</u> killed jake.  and it's a big difference.  you kill an old man, that's one thing.  nobody cares about an old man.  you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. never.
good.  can you tell me how to get to beverly hills?
i thought so, i noticed your name when you were announced.  i'm corsican too -- my name is arena.
there ain't nobody here, mr. hillyer! honest, there ain't!
i am on the track of...
it's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words. the truth!  correct?
i'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. and because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. like, perpetual darkness.
luke didn't smoke.
why not?
are you sure?
you okay?
alleged killer.
how's sleeping beauty?
what about... now?
curing countless diseases, not just ours.
i drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...i let the ambass- ador out of my sight.
the ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
good concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. i hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi's moonies.
sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
...if i had your looks, better.
i, i tried to go back for him, to save him, but i couldn't get to him in time. the fire... have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? it's like a liquid, it slides over everything. it was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. and then he was gone.  i never told anyone until now. but this ship knew, dj. it knows about the goliath, it knows about corrick. it knows our secrets. it knows what we're afraid of.  and now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
i can kill a hundred ordinary people.
i think so.  they're on location in arizona, shooting a western. i'm free every evening, every week- end.  if you want, we could work at your place.
that sure smells good.
golly, i hadn't thought of that.
on what.  what makes you so certain.
confused?
what?
i know, i know.
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. little abraham will go to stanford for college, batya will go ivy league, maybe vassar.
sorry, cowan, i found out literally just before the ceremony.' apparently you're to report for further review.
c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. c'mon, now.
can i come in?
i don't remember him any more—ma, where's russia?
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
you matter to me.  completely.
breaker there, earl.  what do you want us to do?
i'm tired of playing overseas.  thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
you find the source?
i hope you don't mind, jesse james told me your name.
i'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but i sure as hell can't see one.
you know, i've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. i think you're on to something.
bad news, gentlemen. shore leave's been cancelled.
are you sure?  about me, i mean?
what's the -- hey, liz --
i'm leaving.
i remember.
well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
don't do that.
i can't get it to go up.
thank you, dad, i got it.
excuse me?
sounds good - thank you
oh yeah! i saw you in the newsreel!
yes!
it's john. john...  znhcneelsky.
...afraid.
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ!
why of course --
we can't do this.
bag some z's?
let's meet tonight, okay?
wake up.  make a right at ocean avenue.  the hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
not this kind of heat.
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
hey, george . . .
yes.
i'm calling the ambulance.
of course not,  they're closed. phil fogarty's place.  he'll do it for me.
and he'll need a cyclotron.  he can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard.  new haven, long island, two in cambridge--
now, amos, now--  what?
how will i get back to baltimore saturday?  oh god, i forgot my present for your stepmother -- i took it inside by accident.
no visa.
but you were such good <i>friends...</i>
i'm afraid you are.
not the way i can.
never been better. peter spent the night. i must really love him. he's still alive.
oh, of course!!  there's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: the secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
so, what were they doin'?  you're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
long distance? i wouldn't do that to you. i'd at least talk to you.
very well, thank you. i have something for you, john. i'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
alright.  you want me to get your old job back?  because i could, you know, i could put in that word.
nice town that you've got here.
you need to knock off the pills, clair.
i'm not going to curse.
it's not hard to do.  i do it all the time.
bring order out of chaos. if you lead... they'll follow.
yeah?  so what?
gentlemen, i didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, i just want to explore the possibilities. now, i have three questions; is the man a foreign agent? or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? now, i'd like some answers.
i'm through!
what is it?
i'm sorry amanda. i am. and i'm sorry for the things i said about him.
what the hell are you doing?
alright. this is your penance. say two rosaries and... be careful, loretta. reflect on your life.
yes, sir.
my flesh and blood!
are you in pain?
that's enough, holloway.  i've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
listen -- could you stop crying, please?
what are we downloading?
doug?
what's that?
i have some very good memories there.
i ain't got no boy.
so, larry, how have you been?
coffee might be nice.
mike! you have a mess on c-9!
need to lose some weight.
lord walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the english art world.  has a couple of doctorates no less.
do you know about the chip?
sure, doc.
you win some, you loose some.
the man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
i don't know.
mami, the first time i brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
what it says on the bumper sticker up front. on that pickup.
how about richard grayson, college student?
"somebody's gonna die" by blitz. "bella lugosi's dead," bauhaus. it's got that creepy halloween feeling.
hey, is that "old dog tray"? sounds like "old dog tray".
-- i bet you have.
you okay?
god, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
impressive.
i'm...
hit the brakes!
actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  the rest weren't so bad.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
you wanna go on a date with me?
really? in that case, i challenge you to a battle of wits.
must be nice.
but from now on it's lucky's spot.
hey.
well i'm the doctor. i'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
what if i say no?
let's go niggers!
stan... c'mon...
kitty, i would appreciate... if you could wait...
in the abstract maybe. get a grip on yourself! but when i imagine you going out with other guys, i feel... ah...
we'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer new york.  i'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  and when otho and i get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
hey -- look officer -- i can explain everything. it was just -- you know, everything all of a --
i don't believe it.  you're here! oh thank god.
no way. get out. i'm gonna tell frank. i'm gonna tell him what you said.
we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
you have other information?
give it to me!!!
mother--
not something they tell dependents.
you guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
i'll miss you, mike.
oh.  okay then... lloyd dobler, 555-1342.
the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou. they were convinced that bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  the irs wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  i agreed to cooperate.
"frank" was my mother's father.
i didn't realise! those were de-caps! i didn't know that....de-caps... revived!

no, dad. you did. forty years.
crossing the horizon. optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
no, don't ask me!

'yes' to the deal?
do you got something for me?
anything.
i didn't mean to get personal.
what is your name?
selina.  hi.  didn't mean to --
photography teaches you nothing, ann! click! one second and you've seen all you're going to see. i want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... i want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. understand the carving and you will understand the people! that ann, is the key to archaeology.
get it through your head, little girl; i'm not going for you.  if this toby likes you, then if i were you i'd marry him.  you're not going to get much better in this town.
what? yes, that's fine.
mrs. johnson! mrs. johnson! is it true cary grant has proposed to you?
thanks for the promotion, man.
no kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
really?  then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
tomorrow, at the gym. don't forget.

i was going to tell you. but then we were getting along so well, i didn't want to mess it up.
and the honor of having served the third reich.
but what was a hair dresser from malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
because, if the british got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  and the revolution would be finished.  tell king louis, it's that bad.
yes, sir -- i learn to write a little bit, and i can read a lot--
help!
steve said you were thinking of leaving. true?
he's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  he's too cautious.

interview over, blattis ...
my health. i came to casablanca for the waters.
i hope it wasn't something i did.
what do you want?
the van garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  and the widow windsor was next...
sweetheart, no.  don't be ridiculous.
you got that right.  and we ain't brothers.  maybe we should just end this right here.
it's passing over earth as we speak!  trajectory coordinates are 009843.

your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
all right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  is he as good as you say?
i can't find that charm daddy gave me from india.
why not? he's a thief--he's a criminal.
what? happy? why? because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you?
i've still got a few teeth in my head, mr. gittes, and a few friends in town.
i don't know. he just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
good.  and how are you?
where were you?
what are you doing here?
i'm sorry. professor tripp. maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks... really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe i'm just a little sad.

a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. i'm honing my craft.

responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what southglen high schoolers have come to call "the court." seventeen-year-old kristen rey says, "yeah, everyone who's anyone is at the court on saturday night."
it beats dr. simm's theory.  she thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
no particular reason.  just to go somewhere.
mr. kazuzo sent me.
you <u>were</u>?
what exactly do you do?
we had a deal!
yeah, yeah.

i'd like it if you could stay the night.
this is bad.
boys, listen.  you're scaring the straights. let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  god, listen to this!  "it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
gracious... no.
you know what a disparity is?
how is he these days?
what'd he say?
are you disrespecting this court, mr. white?
no. not exactly. it didn't exactly cool. marylin is a knock-out. and very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
try to understand, vickie. jake's got a lotta aggravation. he's been a top contender too long.
well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and i'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   and the best to marion...  where have <u>you</u> been?

that's what i said. now, lis- ten to me. i want you to help me take this woman down stairs. i will give her a shot. you can take care of her till i get help.
this it?
you're gonna let us go?
no ... it's just going to start now ...  if i could just ... if i could just ... sleep.
this is stupid.  it's going on a month now.  how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards?  they can bomb them all they want, saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. what the hell is the army waiting for?
not too sweet! you make it too sweet they don't eat it.
what dares the slave come hither, to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? now, by the stock and honour of my kin, to strike him dead, i hold it not a sin.
this is my city. i'm a cop. i'll find Œem.
oh, shit, that's not right.
ouch. too young! i just got that. you know how to hurt guy. how old are you?
come july, twenty-five.
but this is public property.
reporters, jerry.  they been callin' all night.
what was he like?
it's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
so what do you want me to do?
that was a nice girl last night, marty.  she wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  i said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
he's floating.  take it home.
they must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
clear the bridge, captain...?
i said go around!
five's not so many. there were families with seven kids. a grandmother. a dimwit uncle.
anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
i still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. you expect your father to come through?
did you say something?
i think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  how does it feel to be dead?
yeah, sure.
what are you doing?
well, sir, i'm an excellent filer.
enough to discern its tenor.
i'll take a ride.
are you damaged?
have you got a pocket compass?
are you riding with me, james?
where are you?
um.  happy for you.
let's face it.  sooner or later we all die.
jus' take it slow, buddy.
the boston pops.  season tickets.
may i try it?
come on, honey, let's get out of here.
and your mother was very beautiful. she must be proud of you.
tell them i'm at st. mary's off the kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until i come out.
i didn't hear it.
look, john, i'm facing it.
oh yeah?  me, too.
well.  it appears someone's been lying to us.
listen, rog. i knew hobbes was funny, you know? i told you that. but i didn't really know just how funny he was. see... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. i'm hobbes's partner, right?  anyway, i've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. we never really knew what it was we were working on. hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
look, i ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
oh --
when i was younger, i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
it's different every time.
don't get excited, peter. they just asked a civil question.
sorry. my life isn't that interesting. i go to work. i go home. i don't know what to say.
i'm glad. seriously... i'm very glad.
...i'm not sure that's pete.
hey, buffers.  you look thrashed.
who are you, master?
that's an agent. manager's get fifteen percent.
you are somebody.  you're the man i love.
you lie! on ceti alpha v there was life, a fair chance to --
well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. i don't want to ruin your willpower.
christ, i haven't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978.
uh huh.
chris!
annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
i heard it was an accident.
we have to try it.  we can't stay here.  melanie needs help.  mother, the house won't take another attack.
who was that?
thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
if there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
i have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
what restaurant?
why ith dat newth?
welcome back.
but i feel like— my friends won't talk to me.
what i'm trying to say is, i've loved you since i was eleven and the shit won't go away.
nice.
you're zimmermann's calculator, archie.  all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
brenda was right. there's more to the story than the professor told us. i found a secret room. it had all these news clippings about hugh kane. he was a very evil man.
you okay?
your grandmother?
so you're our own private guy?
did you hear about my misfortune, robert?
you're with me to be close to her?
show.  me.  the.  money.
i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay?
it is not over.
alfred, if i've never told you...i just want to say...
ms. langenkamp.  i suggest you go home and get some rest.  your son is fine. he's been taken downstairs for further testing.
so when are you comin' to pick us up?
hi, daddy.
bobby's out .. what's the hurry?
this is so fucked up. somebody fucked us big time.
i'm well, thank you.
your son.
where were you?  on a... uh,					* mission?
are you all right?
...in the morning.
was that like a homo-sexual remark?
mr. white, please, i promised those people i'd get back to them by this morning. what do you think?
yeah. i sure know that. yeah, but how many more are out there?
you sure?  i can help you.
i didn't follow you!
no, more of an acquaintance.
i meant you're into ghosts.
it's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
dad, we can't decide unless rudolf gets to look too!
we'll always have paris. we didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to casablanca. we got it back last night.
it feels a little confined here. let's take a walk.
and listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? you all right? okay.
look, i can do it!
give us your money man.
he's in college?
nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid?
hey, i'm not stupid, y'know. they can't build anything like that yet.
never been here before?
oh god! are we in that episode?
oh, honey... what happened?
so, no goat hooves, huh?
you mean fred and ginger?
then why am i here? what did you want with me?
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
let me do it then.
as long as internal affairs wants you to, i suppose.  sit down, nick.
maybe i should drive this time.
exactly how late are you, lynette?
i have no doubt that he has, your majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
yours, or the turkeys?
stay away from me...
she's changed.
k-r-o-one.
what are we going to do?
it isn't in your hands, mama. it's my life.
goddamn. will somebody please tell me why i read this spy crap.
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  by what he said?
okay, so i don't like it any more than you do.  i'm just saying
pretty good. sure was surprised to hear from you. you talk to bill?
who's that?  pentangeli?  frankie &quot;five-angels&quot;...thought you were never coming west.
what was god thinking when he built this place?
what do you do? tell her you love her.
but she ran away.
...has a prior commitment.
no. she happens to think the last one was murdered.
i owe you a very serious apology, young man.  it wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  i sincerely hope that you do not.
what-are they speaking?
what'd you find up there?
if you're happy with phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact hospice to arrange for the body --
what's his name?
yes, eve. that would be good.
jesus, if someone had --
is it dead?
what'd i do?
i haven't got a union. i'm slave labor.
you misunderstood.  no one sees max.
she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  that we've created ourselves a ghost?  come on!
what a cozy little scene.
hey, i was workin' her.  i was workin' my thing.
a boy comes to the door.
dr. symington, how big is your dick?
i said go ahead.
i've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, chauncey. you're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
really? ballet?
having considered my position here at court, i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign.
i don't care <u>what</u> you say! in constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
cash or check? for the cabin...
course i can't. i'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
yeah.
victor, explain yourself.
the gun's right on your back...
why do they call you frank?
you're a careful kid, and that's good.  but look.  an international dispatch on the wire service. american journalism, not propaganda. the government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  all but their radio station.
johnnie... that's the past... we gotta get on to our future, sugar!
beach boy.
kate, listen.
can you fix him for me?
i can't jack. how can i?
i'm not interested in nostalgia, rico, i need a corporal. you're it until you're dead or i find someone better.
well, i tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
you're lying.
you gotta be fucking crazy!  you got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
no.
what?
oh?
all injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
what's gotten into you, baxter?
i hope it wasn't cheap.
yeah...?
what are you doing?
two minutes to get on broadway. they're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  eleven to get downtown.  four to the lower east side.  six to clear the roadwork.  one minute margin for error.  my math says twenty-four.
not if you're over sixteen.
huh?
do you think you have a good memory for faces?
like you and gordon?
no —- not yet.
do you want him all the way to the car?
i saw you out there. you want him to call you back, need you.
the one you were telling me about?
why you nitwit. you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
but it's...
i'm going to miss the game.
132 to 133 this is 134.
lydia.  what the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  go help your mother.
you're going to live with mr. thatcher from now on, charlie!  you're going to be rich.  your ma figures - that is, er - she and i have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. you'll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to -
oh, well, thanks. ah, oh, maybe you know where...
we'd be in the hole by now. hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
yes.
put your pilot on.
they keep saying there's nothing i could've done.  that's a lie.  i could've done something.  if only i'd paid attention to my feelings.
thirty-seven. i just can't...
you used to call me "james".
me too... i love this stupid old town. it's noisy. it's smelly. it's falling apart.
i know it was them, star.  i'm sure of it.  he was working in the yard -- hammering something.  the yard was big with lots of grass.  there was no boardwalk and no ocean.  she was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  i was there, too.  and a dog -- but i don't know its name.  i was running and the dog was chasing me. then i turned around and chased the dog.  they were watching me. drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  and i was laughing, too.
you mean like couples?
nothing personal, mrs. mulwray, i just --
i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
i suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
you would?
sir?
hopeless. it's hopeless.
and that's the basis of this "declaration of independence"?
rob, hi, so sorry i missed your call. in la on business.  you know how it gets.
aww, naw, amy, that won't be necessary. i shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, i guess.
there's old saying my mother told me. would you like to hear it?
i'm tired of living on the fringe.
what does he know about the highlands?
that one.
i have some thoughts. i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
another fifteen seconds to go.
yeah, okay. well, siddown then.  i'm carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud.
i don't. i don't know him.
how do you know where the gun is?
i've been to pittsburgh.  does that count?
what... the hell is that?
taylor - get your ass over here. move!
richter!  call from cohaagen.
what's your name!
last time you said that the renaissance happened.
you'd lie to protect him.
karen! what the fuck are you doing?!
oh, i love that stuff.
the tough part's almost over for you. i mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
this is good. who did it?
we're hoping it's only a temporary problem, admiral...
i know a thing or two about marriage. you... you understand me more than anyone, harry... maybe even more than mama. but... you're too important to me. i'd fail you. i don't know how or why, but i would. and that's a chance i just can't take. do you understand?
<u>people</u>?  hell, <u>national</u> <u>geographic</u>.
think about it!  they followed you every step of the way.  there was always a safety net.  the taxi, there was a diver.  at my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
mr. carter, merry christmas.
why do you want to know?
somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, officer crow foot.
what did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
you talkin' to me about ramada inn?
may i see your license.
yes.
how's your precious little school-marm today?
"our" car, walter?
doesn't sound like me.
she's innocent, jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
so, what-you're stuck here all day?
mondays.
oh, ah... you know that guy in whose camper they... i mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
hello, hildy! what are you doing around here?
about what?
they sure must have been travelin'. this keeps up we can start a store.
meyer.
a certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
a vote?
there they are!
no. no thank you.
i ain't cheated you, pilgrim. this is research, damn it! that girl could have told us something.
hey.  this is looking good!  paul, where's the octopus motor?
say, professor tripp, is all that stuff true about errol flynn? how he used to put coke on his dick. to make himself, you know, like, last longer?
we can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
no, i figure he stays here.  where's your registration?
about the ottos?
investigation of what?
she's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
you really want to know?
fuck off.
i don't like what you're saying.
what shall we do?
yeah, they told me.
does he know you know?
you're a superstitious fucker.
i never told you my name.
you're probably right.
where am i?
why? who said?
you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. if i wasn't already the head of it, i'd want the same thing.
nothing. i was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
i don't know.  if it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  it was still searching for meaning...
i wish my funbags would get bigger.
tell us, jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir?
hello, mr. burns. yes, she's still here.
yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
gerald.
to old friends.  and your new dreams.
leave me alone!
what was she doing?
like...?
virginia, i'm flattered you think i got that much energy. i just figured if i can't find paul sheldon, at least i can find out what he wrote about.
tell her to forget it - i don't need her help.
what was this desperate urge to see me?
you don't know him?
did you kill ilio manzetti?
you're a thief?
it is johnny.  he came all the way from california to be at the wedding.
exactly four steps now. let me lead you.  now to the right. it's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
what the hell did you do that for? what are you doing here?
answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare?
no, not, not everything. this. i am the man in your life.
a good lay.
harry...
can i come in?
hi mark, cindy, ben.
there's nothing in the stores.
i love you too major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
and the argies.
dixie mccoy
he was sitting here?
pendergast!  help!  it's right behind us!
it took a long time, but eventually i learned to live with it. and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me.  i knew things about people, about events, about time.
i'm just quiet.
oh, jesus!
josh, i have to speak you, it's urgent.
oh, god, she's out there...
what do you want?!
i'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? a senator! a united states senator! i thought i'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, diz! when i think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, i can't take it, diz--i'm through--i quit!
i mean if you knew karate?
please, feel free to inspect them.
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  that it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
adhara.  i told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
i'm not so sure i can say the same thing...you don't look like a cop.
jasmine has this thing for dolphins. i had them make it...
hi, nikki. this is mike again. could you just call me when you get in? i'll be up for awhile, and i'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
what did you wish for, honey?
you manipulated me into this...!
10,000 m.s.l., admiral.
i have money --
how'd you get to know so much about him?
no?  i guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
two down and two to go.
i thought she was dead.
let me try this, goddamnit! she's been doing it all week, she can do it now!
oh, there is no hurry. tonight he'll be at rick's. everybody comes to rick's.
what was that?
could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
afford it?
there's a little something wrong with it. just this part here--the right ventricle. it's slightly enlarged.
...gotta go...
bob?
i can fix it.
my mary -- she's not in japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. she does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
just sing!
we're not skipping this treatment.
i'm a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
i know who you are! isn't it your picture in the newspapers? didn't i see you this morning on the video? are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
...noon.
is there something else?
here's the order for the plows. we got a good price on them.
no more... i can't!
that fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
well how do you feel about him, then?
i'm not crazy about the "little..."
but maybe with a good start i can hit those hand-holds.
jump in the water!!
are you having boy trouble? i gotta be honest; i don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
no, but would you think, from that one sentence.  that i was going to see it?
they wouldn't know me.
how do i find them?  their offices are empty.
are you a private detective?
you have yourself a few flings this summer. i bet you're quite a ladies' man.
no ... thanks though... i'll take a cigarette if you have one.
well, for the past couple of years i've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
inhale this, but do not touch.
yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
rather an obvious question under the circumstances, don't you agree?  a better one might be how do you feel?
i could've got more ... if i'd just ... i don't know, if i'd just ... i could've got more...
a friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
i can't. i can't. you think you know so much.
what id we run into someone i know?
how about the "hell merchants"?
any idea what he looks like?
now, just a minute.  you have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why joseph should not give my wife the money which i left for her. i can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
you're vulnerable.
you don't believe in suicide.
why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
what?
not that i don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--i wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
i know how you feel -- i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. you know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
to accept your surrender. i can clearly destroy you at any time. lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  major, what am i to tell dr. furtwängler?
oh... we split up.
charlie,. i've been trying to postpone this. but what's the point? it's over.  i don't want to hurt you. this is very hard for me. i'm doing this for both of us. i really want you to be happy.
what are you looking at?
you're just like you mother! always jealous!
start talkin
business.
he's a rapist. like mine.
all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
how are we gonna do this, nick?
an excellent quality.
i hope we get some more help.
wonder what?
cassandra's really smart.
how come?
doctor. now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
i thought i'd made it clear, i'm not just putting this mission together -- i'm leading it myself.
and another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
you gotta think of your old age.
things? what kind of things?
what's weird about that?
yes, that's the truth. but i was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
you're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
roman and everybody else went home for the night. i'm here for a make-up test.
hey.  where'd you learn to shoot like that?
well i want to leave.
no, see, he always ordered a bottle of dom perignon when he was ready to go. then he'd pay up and be out the door.
nice piece. you come back here to cover your tracks, geronimo? what's your name?
you bring him up yourself? that's a steep climb.
spreckled with uncountable stars. the stars are shining right now. we just can't see them. just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
children?  well, we really don't encourage them.  they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
let me get this straight. all that paper that went into the river. that was the only copy?
no. it's for a lot of other things, too.
you got something on your mind?
you're not that bad... come on we'll get you to a doctor.
but i got two hundred and fifty coming.  it's my share.  jimmy owes me.
look, mr. charnier, you got to be reasonable.
a whole lot, frankie.
you should grow a moustache. you're a real man now.
i like your style, dude.
yeah!  gold!  how much?
i was in there in him.
well then that's not exactly dating is it.
about me?  how sweet.
you know you keep saying that.
look, i got a rule.  i don't talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
thanks, baby.
so, how is it that you guys are fluent in russian?
that's on time for margo.
what!?  he <u>can</u> and i <u>can't</u>?!  no fair!!
belinda's a very jealous person.
shelly, the machine, levene.
come on, lee.  stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  there must be something you want.
i don't understand.
been waiting long?
wait a minute.  i'll go with you.
dad, i think i may be able to get you enough information to make sure the da can nail this bastard.
well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
i'm not upset, myra, okay.  i just never thought of you as a y'know...
with all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
what about the schools?
white boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
what's she so emotional about?
terrible. boring.
what's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. that would imply you already knew the number.
i know this may seem like a strange question, but can i ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, i know you're a professional, but just for me, i was just wondering.
sorry.
i know what a "witness" is.
sure.  you got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
with the pearls?
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  and the tide rushes in.
did you straighten her out?
he thinks you stole his promotion.  what exactly you doin there, john?
would you mind taking a walk with me?
my teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. so that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
he's thirty-five years old.
my ass is falling.  it is.
because you're probably the last person i'll ever talk to.
who is it?
no. don't. you'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
not really. i didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, i thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
how do you know?
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room.
hello, david...
she can't get both of us.
you have somebody else out there?
everybody has a past.
paint it out.
i'm sure you do. you probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
and so what?
we both missed.
what?
hey ronald.
jeanette, you're hurting me.
you know what you remind me of?
...i wouldn't lie to you, adele. . . i saw him kill that man.
i feel very good in here.
isn't it great up here... he's gone now, but we had him on the run! we would've had his ass if we had horses! he's running scared!
one two, freddie's coming for you? no. rod killed tina. he's a fruitcake and you know it.
i forgive you.
like what.
that's crazy. how could she find out about it?
let's roll.  we got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to doucet. 0800 this morning.
i feel the same, sir.
i really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
why?
yeah, weird. but great.
we got a lot to talk about.
yes, sir.
i got released.
-- no, that's okay. it's just sean...
no.
we got the wire ya was comin'. you're the indian official, yeah?
beautiful. what time are you off...  ...christy?
up there they wouldn't be a problem.
how interesting.
that's a lie!  they still want me!
uh-huh.
i'll talk to the mayor.
have you forgotten?  i don't need any samples where i'm going.
yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  think.  what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  he was on the phone. except that cable is a thousand feet long, norman.  they would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
name something.
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
we don't even like each other, do we?
you didn't really believe me, did you?
i'm camera shy.
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
he's not here.  he's not at juvenile hall.  i don't know where he is.  he's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  how old are you?
c'mon.  let's go to the ho---
and that was her. annabelle horse... field.
i'll tell him when he comes in.
allright. i admit it: i'm prejudiced. i don't want to work with a homosexual. you got me.
charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
so he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
the guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form hauser...all of that was set up by us.
to caitlin!!
he has a great body
the camerawork's nice.
what'd he say?
ctu?  jesus.  you don't think --
it's an anti-christian dogma!  i cannot believe you are so calm about it!
i need your advice —— something has happened —— mr.  jacks ——
today, over at the house.
silence!  i order you!
do you watch the news?  read the paper.  last week, this whole place was underwater.
and what, sergeant?
he was a corrupt cop, verbal.
i don't understand. you just said he said no.
sleep. sleep now.
got a reason to stay.
every seat for the opening has been sold at vienna. sold out for three days.
no, that should be more than --
what?
he went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  did i tell you that?
stuff.  that means you have to get more schooling.
now, that's practically uncut. you could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  you need six.
how do you know they're not?
i think i've lost my mind. i think you're not real. i think i'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
well -- i realized that she wasn't interested in me.  she was just trying to get information out of me.
what the fuck are they waiting for? that motherfucker cut off my ear! he slashed my face! i'm deformed!
what's up?
stan, your friends need you. they are in trouble and you must help them.
what's the matter?
hey, carl, what's wrong ?
load a new tape, turn the camera on.
don't you believe it.
nonsense. she's one of the nicest girls i know.
it's not the machine. there's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... ah there we go! that's a b58/732 when it should be a t47/215 ... tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not buttle.
yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. we must get close to her.
you've been staying in a motel all this time?
now what?
hey!  you're not eatink.
do you just hate everything? how could you possibly rape my...
it's worth a shot. i can arrange a controlled meeting. a careful dose of sedatives for jason, some security, you and i monitoring. evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
yeah.
let's walk.
hey! what are you trying to pull!
i did not break nor enter. i simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
shouldn't pick on that.  sorry.  i'm sorry about your brother....
we'll see what we can do.
i get the idea.  you got a description?
george, i've been putting things together. do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. what brought them there? unless it was to meet us?
and?
let's see if you can follow me around this room.  the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase - bowtie, 12 o'clock. the other imf team.  you're worried about me. <u>why</u>?
thank you, no. i have some work to do... assuming i can still log on.
here it is; the last chapter.
good luck.
one drink minimum per show. everything's ten dollars. now... tell me what you want or i'll eighty- six you.
my goodness, don't you open your presents until christmas morning?
i'm just having my last few drinks.
oh, sit down, man. what you tasting? i'm buying.
so what do you make of it?
hello.
chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
he said he was her cousin.  i told him where she works.  they were just here.
bastia -- and you?
figured you knew more about swords than i did.
you can't bring it.
how long's this been going on?
who cares? chicks are for fags.
because it exists.
seymour? you gotta be kidding me!
to celebrate misery's return. i couldn't have done it without you.
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do. the fuckers are going to kill me one day.
human children can be very beautiful.  getting married?  congratulations. you will be taking sunday off, then...
they make plucky women in new england.  h'm ... how long have we to wait?
no --
what else is there?
i want them all.
give me the film.
i'm going to put a stop to this!
you know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school.
all right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. okay? you happy? so now what?
i told you i don't know.
absolutely.
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel.  i will kill both him and the man who told me.
when you get engaged?
good.  perfect.  i'll be in new york with walter, i can squeeze it in.
...under?
--and i guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... i suppose the most important thing, really. i don't know. anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. it's my shrink, really.
good point.
you know you just do this for shock value. it's not shocking.
where?
why don't you go to the police?
i have sectors 1-28.  i think hector has the upper levels.
will you rent me a cabin, or not?
boss loader!
yes, that's right.  my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  you and i should have a lot of laughs.
knock on wood.
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
prouder still. you'll be the handsomest student there.
i don't; you did.
no, i've never played anything cool in my entire life.  spike, who i'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
what did you say?
so you'll stay?
if you don't mind me asking... who are you?
that ain't no happy child.
you don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
upon my word, sir, i think you have acted very coolly.
you know what this is?
he's dead.
no. what you usually say, i guess.
it's gonna get riper yet.
two vehicles.  they're not supposed to be here.
i... uh... have a date with someone friday night.
mr. halloran, what is in room 237?
... death ...
wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
is that it over there?
i mean it. don't say one fuckin' word.
are you challenging me?
how much extra?
what would you do up here?
your pleasures of course!
i dunno... something.  why is she doing this to me? why?...
otherwise.  i trust you know the difference.  you're an intelligent woman, finished at nyu.
you went to my high-school?
you wave back?
earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
yes, i know, dear, but mrs. burke had her baby yesterday. nine pounds! and there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the community chest lady came around and—
jonah, this isn't fair.  you don't know victoria.  i hardly know her myself.  she is, in fact, a mystery to me.  she tosses her hair a lot.  why does she do this? i have no idea.  is it a twitch? does she need a haircut? should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? these are things that i'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why i am dating her.  that is all i am doing. i am not marrying her.  can you appreciate the difference? that's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  but nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
i don't know, give me a minute.  are you all right with this?
governor dickerson? of florida?
why would i want to?
they're not here.
i know.  i know.  they'll say anything.
receipts and bills and... everything's here.
dr. meirschultz, please.
juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
free verse, huh?  what the dickens was free about it? it cost this paper a gob of dough. well, i'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
-- i told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
steph.
you misinterpret everything.  we've all been friends our whole lives.  but that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
what does the letter say?
i know about that shot.  a terrible tragedy.  how much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
there's something out there!  let's go get it now!  that's why we came down here, isn't it?
may i ask you a question that might sound strange?
what kind of name is that?  to be named after a city?
maybe he's talking to himself.
well, here we are back at fucking school again.
this is just our cover.  we're dedicated to a higher purpose.
oh, great.
what's he running for?
really.
what was it for?							   *
wanda and hartley.  they lost bear. he was their adopted son.  a beautiful boy.  indian.
stu was with me last night.
a cup of the old chai, sir?
if they find you here they will kill you.
sorry.
what brings you inside?
compared to what came before? a year of living in the sewers?  a part of that will always be with me.
ain't you gonna see what it is, homer?
animals that -- that eat straw?
kim?
i'm afraid so. if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans... earth will remain in the second dark age... an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century.
not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
home.
got a little action there, eh buddy?
bob?
watch it!
what do you mean?
and how long will you be away?
and that was the end of it?
he's from new york city. that one, too.
i don't need nice. i don't need myself to be it and i don't need anyone else to be it at me.
monescu!
you know i do know the way home.
welcome to the singles scene.
somewheres. i don't know yet.
how'd you get started?
i'm glad you've come home, conner.
a can opener! a $39.95 can opener. i canceled payment... it was junk.  you ever bounce a check, lowell? you ever look at another woman's tits? you ever cheat a little on your taxes?  whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
wanna fuck?
shhh, shhh. you're not going to jail, frances. the judge has put you under my care. i'll see you get the rest you need.
really? do you want them to overrun all new york colony?
could i get another room.
when i get back i'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
that ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in san pedro. there was this ensign...
i dunno. see if i have any connections.
but...i've seen you.
well, when i first came to washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
saw your movie the other night. watched it with some friends.
i'm getting a little bit fat. i hate that.
hey, you!  better get outa here!
stand by. one.
i have a wonderful disposition, i put people right at ease.
no key!
stacy--
how do you open the damn door?
sorry. we got knocked out pretty quickly.
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy?
no. she's probably scared to death.
jesus, sally.  i'm not the enemy.
the ships?
she changed the codes.
are you asleep?
what do you need at the store?
fantastic but i'm a little busy right now.  listen.  do you want to come to dinner saturday?  i'm having some friends over and i need a spare man. are you a spare man?
it's alright.  i can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  what is this place?
and more.
what about tonight?
i'm not a murderer, mr. mckenna.
gordo?
crash override. what was it. "mess with the best, die like the rest?"
i demand to know what is going on...
you sure?
someone's playing hardball.  it's complicated.  can i ask a favor?
i'm tired, paul. so tired. i have to rest a while.
yeah, those guys too.
de vries?
lily and i talk a bit. you know lily, runs the coffee shop?
yeah, it is.
please, eddie, don't beg him.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
arch light.
dad says you have to get up!
you're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
do you like poetry, raymond?
you got the admissions letter.
just say yes! nothing else, just say yes.
god creates man, man creates technology, technology creates god.  end into beginning.
sneak out in the morning.  before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  never figured i'd be on the other end of it, though.
the truth! well, the man wants the truth! "what *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
do you want it on?
well, whatta we got here?
can i give you one bit of advice? about shari?
oh god, how horrid.
you see?
very good, busyboy.
not now, mom, please.
maybe he'll get back to work.
what? why'd you do that?
peters, i want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
what are you, henry friggin' kissinger all the sudden?
i'll pay you a thousand dollars.  i have it in my wallet.
this is kind of a cool place.
who?
i don't know. he was just so charming. all he did was talk about how i had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. things just got out of hand from there.  mom? are you there? mom?  mother!!!!
take it easy, pop.
what are you gonna do when you get home?
uh, huh...
john thinks i'm so snotty.
elmer's glue?
i've thought about it for years.  i knew you'd come. and i knew if you did - you'd never leave.  am i forgiven for sending for you?
peter found him?
he gets fed six times a day. he's got a thing for cats. you'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. he never goes out unsupervised --
isn't everybody? what can i do for you, miss sessions?
you know what i'd like? a clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  and the wherewithal to buy what i'd like.  mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
what does it matter.
i'm sorry we haven't met sooner, mr. gardiner. i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. i'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president.  ... tell me, mr. gardiner, just how serious is benjamin's illness? i did not want to upset mrs. rand by discussing it in detail.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  what an asshole. cabbie's name is max rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
live together.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
that's good money.
this is a little nuts.
a book of delusions.  anything else?
no.
...i'm sorry.
i'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  at a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
how do you do.
my oh my.
oh my.
the queen will be riding to st. george's on the fifth.
no... go on.
we've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. the way they can work together as a team.
that's no reason. everybody wants to fly. my grandmother wants to fly. you going after a job with one of the airlines?
if you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
this was a selective operations unit, agent levoi. there is classified information pertaining to our national security. you don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. jesus christ --
you think you know what this money is?
what's wrong?
is that...permanent?
you should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
what did you think you were doing in his tent?

mickey rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
- all's i know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
oh, that... sure, i saw the whole thing. it was disgusting!
i hope to christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
when you do have one i'd like to hear it.
jad.  how come you're not out there with father witwer?
how long have you worked here?
what!?  look at the ticket...!
they've done it before. takes maybe two minutes.
christ, can't you hear it?
hard to believe, isn't it...?
i drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
... deborah ann kaye ...
oh, i did shakespeare in the park, max. i got mugged. i was playing richard the second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.

i-i honestly never intended for this to happen...

so let's make another "dracula." let's make "the return of dracula"!
you don't want the police any more than i do.
1 saw you lead our cavalry sir
the craftsmanship is extraordinary.
can i take you to the airport?
come and tell me it's over and i'll walk away, jimmy.  i've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- i'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
claire, when did you...
hi.
no.
well...
he's your cousin.
what, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
i've been trying to reach you all afternoon. you weren't in the shop. what is this thing tonight?
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  what is it? you have a fight?
yeah.
nice to see you.  what am i doing in here?
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
who?
yeah?

i'm sorry... about what i said. it's just that -- all those times you and daddy were trying for another kid, i... i used to pray at night that it would work. and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister... but... just so i wouldn't have to be...
i hear he didn't mean to.  the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
god has damned us all. are my atrocities worse than yours?
it's fine with me, beverly.  you want to, honey? you think the kids are asleep?
why don't you like me?
-- i'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. didn't matter how much cash i made pulling wet jobs -- i was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like jon archer after me.  the best part is -- i'm the good guy.
is there objection?  you may proceed, senator.
you're in one hell of a jam.  you realize that?
what a fruitcake you are!
hey, enough fun and games. we have work to do. come on junior. kastle heads for his car. junior gets up and follows. the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands.

and here i thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a tshirt.
never mind. forget it.
i was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  so do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  you held on as long as you could.  yes, everything did go wrong, starting with hal. i mean, what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb?
mmmmgh.

my god, you're shot...

here's another wire, sir. this one's from charleston.  "checking every northbound train. also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. no success yet. will continue to do everything possible." signed: lovington detective agency, charleston.
i didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman. i never saw the ranch again...
then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, bonasera.  but if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
veronica! j.d. told me you committed suicide last night!
i don't know.  you've got two people in there already.  it could get a little crowded.  i want you to close your eyes and relax.  now i'm going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer.
got your badge?
jesus, sally.  you are a medical miracle. the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
who cares?!  we're on a roll!  these are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
you think...
yeah. i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
how long have you been back?
your sister is an unbelievable cook.
yeah.  it should be fun.  you wanna come?
do you have to do that?
go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the french underground --
mr. millaney?
it would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. but no! you had to marry me and spoil everything.
why aren't you understanding?
i said, the northwest valley.
are you in show business?
the world.  <u>thinks</u> i'm gone.  but only the magician.  knows better.
harry!
and you believed me?  but it wasn't my people who did it.
i'm starting to... we may do the capitols of the states.
we're down to seven minutes.
i'm sorry, d'amour...
something bad happened tonight.
well, i'm glad to see you. sorry things broke up like that.
advice? i'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, ben. unless - have you quit your job? they fired you?
<u>i'm</u> full of shit?  you're a monument of bullshit.  you even bullshitted yourself all i am, is taking out the garbage.  bad guys killing bad guys...
i like you, kid. why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
we talked. he wanted to get a bite -- after. i said no.
[this is not possible. but in that house i have money. if i tell you where --]
what's that?
you got something on your mind... "brother."
who cares?
you know how improbable this is...?
i'm not stupid!  you can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
what about them?
they've got a book for this?
we combine everything. you are my second in command.
or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  i mean, he liked laura too, i didn't mean that.  and he likes you.  it's just that --
thought you were going to buy a car.
i knew he wouldn't come.
mornin', son...
i never see you anymore. where are you all day?
locate.
i'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. they didn't let their presence be known until after mr. blonde went off. i'm not sayin' they weren't there, i'm sayin' they were there. but they didn't move in till mr. blonde became a madman. that's how i know we were set up. you can see that, can't you, mr. white?
huh. but it's still a story without an ending. what about now?
difficult? he's impossible!
now listen. the gig couldn't be simpler. you carry the money to the welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. the washed money goes directly to maxie. long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
i've got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger, for the rest of my life. i have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours i might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  look at me, laurel, look at me.  i'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  how do i look?
but his leg!
but what about the drowning boy i've been seeing?
...as the advertising says: tomorrow never lies.
yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
hi. hey.
richie!  she spent six months dating a criminal
where's mitch?
i'm talking about italians!
don't worry, shelly, i'll handle leo.
funded by whom?
well, it's the least i can do.
it's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
uncle, how are you feeling?
was-te. 'cept for one thing. jimmy looks twice was nowhere near there. ya see, when jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near elk mountain.
i can't
mommy saying, 'wake up, wake up, wake up danny, wake up.'
and video games after!
and that pose is out too, sunny jim. the new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. anyway, you won't meet susan if you don't cooperate.
now i'm going to tell you the truth. i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party.
sixth floor too high for you, fink?
because we're running a newspaper, mr. kane, not a scandal sheet.
listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? this is a matter of principle. something you probably wouldn't understand.  when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
you should be.
brill?
just call and let me know that your okay.
screw off.
that's right. and the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
do you know where you are, fran?
boys, boys...
so, like, where is she?
yes!
well, i... i never tried.
you're goddamn right i am!
me? why?
it all went so fast.  he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  i only wanted to defend myself.  you have to call the police...
do what?
i'm here to see brooke windham.
karl, maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. it's a nice night.
a marriage certificate?  who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
i don't think so boyd.
i know.
i mean tomorrow.
honey, please.
is it true? wallace is captured?
hey o'connell! looks to me like i got all the horses!
do you have the right to murder?
what the hell happened?
two-fifty.
what?
make it collect.
let's go!
do you know the... soccer stadium?
then what did you want to gamble for? if you'd have beat us out of fifty g's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? well, we want our dough.
where you signed this?
well, there's a couple of girls in printers alley if you got any questions. i know i've seen that g- string stuff for sale someplace around.
stretch out under the seat, miss.
it's about my salary cheques.
we're here, warren. you wanna get off?
you got a drinking problem or what?
i detest it. but, after all, what can you do... it's the latest...and i try my best to adapt myself.
yeah?!
well, she had problems --
sure you do.
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
so there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
get em....
good night, wade.
is everyone here?
i told you.
have you tackled the great reorganization yet?
hon?
get yourself something to eat.
so... board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
tell me.
i've been hoping to run into you.
it's a very moving experience, trust me.
listen, that was my fault.
i think we all need a good night's sleep.  why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
i'm... a friend of his. his best friend. see, his father...
what are you working on?
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
hm. of course it is not quite that simple.
well, i don't know. the week started off okay, but then i was outside watering the plants, and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect, so i went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
sorsha.
aw, i don't know what you're talking about. all i know is that you're losing your bank and—
well, i ...
so, you thought you'd be cool. go against your father's wishes? yeah, that's grown up.
catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
i didn't do this, i did not do this–
i...
thanks for backing me up here, uncle claude.
you listen to the feelings, not the words.
we could have lunch together.
sick vandalism! brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! i want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby buster browns!
a meteorite, dad, look!
i didn't know you could fly a plane.
well then check back tomorrow.
jesus.
north korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system.  extraction team has to be small and silent -- i'd go with seals over delta force. problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  where's the polk?
one more, eh?
you killed her!
blast door. it's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
i know.  i watched it.  i sort of know it by heart.
what happened, doolittle?
why would sidney want to be with steve? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy.
that's 'cause i <u>wasn't</u> there.
i agree.
i done it again.
it's hard to tell.  i'm gonna have to be close.
good morning.
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
i happen to be a professional.
someone tell me this is really happening.
two officers have been assigned to the case. i can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
i really don't think that's necessary treves. i'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands. indian reservation.
of course he will. [beat] what day of the week is it?
frankie, roth tried to have me killed.  i'm sure it was him, but i don't know yet why.
bodhi, yeah.  i'm on him all day, right.  he goes here, he goes there, he goes to tower records and buys come cds, he has lunch at patrick's road house...  ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan.
damned if i know.
single?
whitney armstrong, my deputy. what whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian...
this is entertainment you're making, toby. this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
and you won't. now move--
about that chest-cutter...
i don't even...what do you mean?  i don't even know what that means.
ray, if you walk out of here with me, i'll get you a job.
aye, honeythorn gump, come to serenade you, jack... come to make you dance.
good.  i've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
i was called and i came.  what's up?
that's dynamite, joe!
the word, sir?
you grey-haired old judas!
hey lovey, come here! lovey, i asked for a glass of wine and look what i got. come on, sit down.
tell me about the kids.
shoes, if you want to know the truth. shoes are my thing.
jack! i didn't like that.
edward...
not even a joey, i'm glad to see you? joey, what happened to your leg?
how many fucking sources they think we got?--
they getting older now and i can't take care of 'em like i used to. more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. now, i don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. i got my own family needs me. it'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
now, what's this?
i hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen beaners up to west virginia.
if magua give women to yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
god... of course.  i'm sorry -- i mean, i'm...  brian -- i've got to go.  the man's a lunatic, but i know exactly where he's going next.
oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
she's good enough for me! and if i was to go home and tell my wife --
do you know who i am?
she used to pinch 'em off me.  funny that.  one thing she never tried to get me to stop.
not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
right behind you.
i'm relieved you said that.
frida, wait. don't go. we can just sleep. i just want to wake up with you.
i'm tellin' you, she'll be there, i know she'll be there. dressed up and everything.
turn it up, magda.
nope.  legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
oh yes, there is.
like your story is over.
you want to get out of here?
fuck it!  i think you better leave.
i consider it less my failure than his.
help yourself.
well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
sometimes... movies mostly bore wally.
come in.
valets, eh?  aren't we all la-de-da.
...they run on water.
it must have stopped moving.  i'm not getting anything.
what is it laura? what's wrong?
mr. treves, some more books arrived for mr. merrick.
do i want you?
the jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and i don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
you, frank.  all these years you been telling me we're different.  we got novelty, jack. no one can touch us.
datura! miguel knew it! datura, he was shouting! datura metel!
no, i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. besides, i always travel alone.
do you understand what i said?
is this what you want? you ask me for this after all i've told you?
it was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
you ain't coming to work?
"60 minutes"?
now what?
macbeth.
i'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
what?
why do you say that?
you have him in restraints.
goodnight.
what's wrong with you!?!
you know, i think it's a little late for that.  do give my regards to gradski if you see him.
you still collect them?
say you're sick.
you're unbelievable.
about eight-thirty in the morning.
you have precious little time. what i've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. you hold in your hand the power to end the project.
a black bull!
why is everybody up at sunrise?
mr. cicci.  from the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;genco olive oil company.&quot;
i didn't see you there. can i help you?
sure. you see, i'd never had a gun in my hand before and i didn't know what to do with it. well, when i get stuck, i know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. so it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? to shoot! so i shot. simple isn't it?
i know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  but what's this got to do with it?
helen, tell matt i want to see him.
no?
i wish you could see the world as i do. deacon opened my eyes. there's no turning back from that.
i know you --
nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
i want to talk to you.  we met ... now, listen, don't hang up, ok? ... we met at the hospital last night.
uh-huh?
holly.
yeah. on my way home now.
listen, americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  you take a little and then come back.
another unknown. not on the charts. a red dwarf.
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
what for?
oh!
pinta, do you have a pencil?
eagle thrust four -- big duke six. join me in sparaying some trees.
try lookin' at it from this angle
forget about it.
lestat escaped the fire!
i'm sorry.
you can hit me, if you want to.
i want you to try something with me, okay?
he said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
let go of the gun.
i'm telling you. i don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
i read your book.
the quest isn't going well?
can you finish on schedule?
so i'll die without a son.
... i don't know.  probably not.
if it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
you're right, jack.  sorry... jack approaches alan.
... can i just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
some of it.  denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
what?
how about bari?
you didn't give them a name.
singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
from what i hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
oh, no.  no.  no.  i meant no scheme.  i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  it's just a thought.
it must have been the only non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
oh, she was here.
this is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, claudia --
get out!
what kind of place is this?
do they go to henley hall?
that's between you and yourself, norma.
you know if there's a way i'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  that puts me and the other new york families against you.
hang...out?
i ran out of bribes. bizimungu took them away.
you'll feel better
no look, really, this isn't nescess ...
oh! something bit me, too!
a buck a shot.
well, i think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
we've got him sighted. okay, pollux, pull out.
you sure you're down with this?
it has. but you'd be surprised. they understand -- they really do. it's not the workers you have to worry about.
no, i'm haitian-puerto rican.
subtle?
you have a red shirt.
strokin'. here goes nothin'.
it's going.  it's going.
i was not a failure.
i <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me shirley! what flying experience have you had?
the check's no good?
okay, tell you what, i'll give you a head start.  you take her to the station house.  don't let her out of your sight. she's the only warm body we got left.
you see, it s like i say. you always have an answer for everything.
what do you do?
i always am.
yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. he's a cop.
mr. mintz?  i don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  you’ll have to come back tomorrow.
"why are we here?  is that what you're asking, jack?... why are we here?  no why.  just here".
you and your real estate.
that's him.  he's a lot prettier in person though.
who's that?
what did he pay you, mimi, to stick to that story?
down to the wire?
sorry, love.
and the wine - excellent.
i kind of got that impression.
how'd you know? these are supposed to be sealed.
don't worry. they're not going to hurt you. come on.  only show this to the driver. nobody else. and don't lose it.
well, look at this. the three of us back together again.
he acquired some sort of power.  a power to manifest things.
sorry, that it a biocyte facility, their storage structure..
you can't kill me.  you're not a cop. just fireman with a gun.  i bet you never shot anybody in your life.
nick --
what happened today?
what's he doing out there?
gary cooper.  and barbara stanwyck. yowsa.
you killed them, huh? both of them?
she's dead.
now, who are all these people?
not great.
no.  but someone you can talk to.
biggest crash in history, front page, new york times, august 10th, 1988. i thought you was black, man! yo, man, this is zero cool! oh, shit!
look at them, philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  do you want your students to turn out like them?
you must think i'm some kind of fool.
she lied to me. i mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. no. not in my house. the truth is a stranger. and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are. marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "how do they find me" she says. ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. i'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... oh, man... are you all right?
gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  they see out the sides.  that one don't even know walter's arm's in his mouth.
no, i absolutely understand. of course.
...you got no cause to hurt me.
you look terrible. have you had an accident?
you know what kind of woman grace is.  you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra.  what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  what's she to you, jake; a woman who would have you dead?  let me kill her.  all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
what makes you so sure?
how much?
then you go into the foyer.
it's not fair on them. it's selfish to keep them with you.
well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
we're making too much of this.
out of here.
here.  buy bullets.  kill.  kill them all!
so?
i didn't know you had this.
something happened, didn't it?
you are home. but go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. in the meantime, i'll be your point person here on the magazine.
see about closing.
it's all right. i'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. the mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  i'm going to need a lot of therapy.
well, my boy, you're a hero.
been telling you that all along, lad.
it was?
what kind of stupid question is that?!
i'm a loser. and i'm drunk. but i'm not gutless.
i watched tv.
why not?
yes.
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  huh? well, i don't know what i'd do without you. you've made up for all the fakes that i've met.
and my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
what i'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
i couldn't help it!  it just popped in there!
i read the hospital report on your client.
she getting good care over there?
oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
i don't feel like rewinding it!
but you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? i can't send you away from here like that!
and you get on very well.
how did you know?
he --
with your permission, mr. president, i'd like to remain my your side.
yep.
the adventures of tom sawyer.
i wanna date a musician...
where were you tonight?
i know...i know. you did the right thing.
i'm going to have to front you personally.  don't lose that money without losing your life.
we're not proceeding anywhere together.
did you ever think life would turn out like this?
hurry up with those papers.
bon soir, mademoiselle!
please calm yourself. you'll soon be well if you do.
who are they?
i guess this is what they call "ironee"? hunh?
this place is dead. i thought this was the city that never sleeps.
i'm babbling.
... okay, then, i have a confession to make.  i'm the batman.
aren't you?
i know you smoke weed, right?
good god... they're shooting midge!
what happened?
i'm handing out a free lei to every customer! what do you think?
helluva game!
one moment, friends, let's give the senator a break.  now, where'd you say you studied law?
oh, mrs. lampert! i'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  oh, dear.
or this -- is this a significant difference?
come on in...
german.
"goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  to the killer.  jerry lee lewis.
i think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
what brings you down from boston, jake? taking advantage of the long weekend?
good.
it wouldn't be like that.  i want to get you off the street.  you'll have a different kind of life. what's wrong with that?
remember?
i don't need you to "stick."
was he morose, or...?  i mean...
there's this kid at school... martin brockett. he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. you wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... who appointed him my spiritual leader? if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? and why's he spend all his time chasing after me? probably thinks i'm gonna give him a hummer...
daddy!
uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
-- forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. why you lied to me, knowing that i'd find out anyway, i'll never know, but it imperative now that i see you.
how did she hide it during the day?
did you always want to be a lawyer?
is it a kappa?
has it been fifteen minutes?
he wouldn't do that.
four hundred and fifty and i'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
yeah.
hullo.
this is the starship enterprise.
if one of you can get that  -- i mean, i want the real superman. who is he? where's he from? what's his favorite ball team? what's up?
get out!
they're doing more than slapping.
shut up!  sorry, dear, i lost control for a minute.
who are you?  what do you want?
cotton.
by the time i'm at the belt, you phone and say, "how are you?"  forty-five minutes later i reply, "not bad.  how are you?"
so what do we do?
they shouldn't have been here.
no, i'd already sent them home. you can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that i'll get it back soon using my own methods.
actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
food for crows.
t-w~e-l-v~e.
have you seen him?
yeah, you betcha.
what did you do with captain amazing?
do you ever do any writing?
well, come back when you do, and i'll bond out the stewardess.
no way. this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying. i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  superfund is just one of those words.  people stop paying attention.
-- last night i dreamt i was fifty years old and mary told me i was supposed to meet jill at the shop. it seared me shitless.
'cause you like their second one, you said, pop, girls. etc.  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover.  you didn't see the cover though.
no, cuz, i rather weep.
instant rice...?
i knew when i first met you.
most enjoyable. herbert greenleaf.
darling, can't you see i'm relaxing in here!
i don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out.
want some coffee or tea?
it's either that or we grow gills.
young man -- you got me there.
manage the whole damn place some day. i'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed....
your lambs are still for now, clarice, but not forever... you'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
all right...but keep your eye on me, boy...i'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...if you don't hear me first time i holler, you better read my mind...i don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
no, cease.  there was no answer.
no, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
you motherfucker.
oh, my god, scooby! i'm so sorry...i'm so, so sorry...
well, wait a minute, will you? i'm in conference.
well, whenever i run across a funny name, i always like to poke around for a rhyme. don't you?
now, we're getting somewhere! they're beginning to contradict each other.  now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... and what about the other boat?
it's okay, i'm all right.  i remember now... it was an animal.  something large!  i could smell it.  it was hunting me.  i saw two green eyes in the dark.
is mary... in trouble?
flip.
when?
no, this is the place for the young yakuza.
you're damned right i'm sure. everybody's got talent. i got talent. you think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? nah. minnesota fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
pleased to meet ya, jack. i read your book. i'm impressed. good work on curtis fox.
take my car, okay?  you come with us, lenny.
i think so too.
she had you tempting fate.
he sent me to find ya. he says he's got information.
i'm tired, too, frank.  if i ain't around no more, it don't mean i don't care fer ye. i care for ye a good deal. i care for you more than anybody they is. we made friends right off the bat.
with my little sparrow leading team.
...well then, that's how many i killed.
mike?  our mike?
the president would like to know if that was the last payment.
you want to go outside?
did you?
lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
amber atkins! that is not american teen princess language!
i can see him right now!
no, well...i've been trying to write.
thanks.
i don't want to say goodbye.
yup.
that movie makes me feel guilty.
yeah.
so much for nutsy fagin.
jackie, you've made mistakes -- we all make mistakes --
have <u>you</u> lost him?
i said i didn't care.
just a little banged up.  a couple scrapes.  why?
really?
yes, madame?
mr. kane is finishing it.
they'll probably believe you.  but they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  why mitchell had a gun.  you'll tell them a simple story.  they'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  now you're headquarters.  how does it sound to you?
uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still new yorkers.
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
please.
i ain't going anywhere. i'm right here. i'm not gonna leave ya.
gee, mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
well, it was an accident.
i don't want to go.
hooray!  we're off to see a wizard!
he has to go, samuel.
mr. dardis does call in every so often?
obviously, the british government denies all of this -
your imagination runs away with you, jack... those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like i mentioned.  a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
me, too.
no, you look good. i was just wondering.
hmm?
right, partner.
she's in the green.
a very convenient guy -- this superintendent. have you checked his bank deposits lately?
not always.  but i want you to know i'm very grateful for what you did for me.
hit your finger, huh?
no.
what?
what? well now i'm in a position where i may just heed your help.
well no...inverse order.
i'm on vacation.  on my way back to school.
i don't know, where are yours?
what the fuck is going on?
where's ebby?
you won.
christ, it's ho-jon!
what?
start unloading.
will you have dinner with me?
we'll go into that some other time.
what's the matter?  upset that i rubbed off on her?
four years ago. of course, that was shortly after his father died.  things may be different now.
she tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
just one word of advice for next season.
how did you ever find it all in yourself, walter?
did i say that? i didn't mean it, or did i?  sometimes i think it would be fun.  go ahead, you better leave now. i can't open myself to you now. i'll tell you a little secret.  i want to die.
yeah...
tell me about layton.
...that filth is better left in the "sin cities."
this is miles from the battle lines. they were probably deserters.
what are you talking about?
won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
not anymore. her parents found her hanging from a tree. her insides on the outside.
it's a plain end, see? so?
people are suffering.
i need this one.
you're ready to move up. christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. may as well get paid instead of punished.
of course.  i am married still.
what'd you say to him?
i do.
yeah.  you don't wanna know the details.
not bad.  what for?
when does this thing stop?
yeah.
doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. clanton came in an hour ago, they switched over to poker.  tried to get him to bed but he just won't let go.
alan, listen to this.
what are you going to do?
we all love the museum.  i come here myself with my kids.  we're trying to work with you.
yes.
they' re dead.
how 'bout it, eve? can he skate around your block?
that is wise. in any case, were i to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
kept us warm for twelve years.
maybe there was traffic.
so last night was pretty exciting, huh?
no. no. the guy from downtown.
no, i don't mind.
my wife said i have to cancel the deal.
well where is she?!
i don't believe it. they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down? what else do they want you to learn?
why not?
someone broke into her place last night.  it wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so i haven't...
...not at all...
where're you going, ichiro?
<u>so?</u> aside from i hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
soft. i'll take the junkie otter, clearly! i'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... okay. would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller--
will you please do it my way? you'll get into trouble if you don't. if anybody talks to you, tell them... i do not speak english.
it's telling me fail mode confirmed.  did you see this?
whadda i gotta do, joey? i knocked him down. what did i do wrong? i don't understand.
she's very tired, poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.
don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? that you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
what?
we know.
i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
he's pretty!
are you ready?
--remember toronto, harry.
these are for my sister... her birthday you see. as she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, i wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
didn't i say?
forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when i get back --
haven't i seen you somewhere before?
are you persuadable?
you got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
but you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. i'm not allowed.
and there?
later.
where do i go now?
... compliments, mr. poe.  take her and get out.
sir. in the matter of the state versus private tyler, i don't want to...
you're putting your talents to very odd use mr lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against central services -
why didn't someone tell me!
i guess that makes sense.
i don't know what you're talking about -- get fucked --
she never should've set foot on this ship. this is your fault!
she lives here too?
i have the species identification on these teeth.  we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  call dr. frock.  he wanted a demonstration.
what did he say?
and you're gonna tell me who.
what's the difference if i'm on call here or deployed in the field.
tee, the beautiful babies don't work wednesdays midnight to six. this is the skank shift.
alice? the others show up?
it's been about a year.
i've been very lazy for a long, long time.
no, you're not. you're a good doctor, lonnie, but you're not david ravell. i've made my decision. now, if you'll excuse me...
no, sir. that girl in the cemetery? my cat didn't kill that girl. i told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. if that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
i know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
it's time to go home now.
that's what we wanted you to think. the fact is, hauser volunteered to become doug quaid. it was the only way to fool the psychics.
he feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
i have to disagree.
i've got a place i can hide her.
we're losing them.
the thought had crossed my mind.
first one i ever killed.
stop talking to them!
wait a minute. i know you. you're kareem abdul jabbar. you play basketball for the los angeles lakers!
fifteen minutes?
well, that's it. he'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first rem-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
that's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
i won't do that.
ohhhh!
no, mam... i come from way back there. me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
you may not. and besides, it is irrelevant.
look, if you can get them to finish it by friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
we'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
you can't curse in front of it either.
sit down.
fourteen-b. it's halfway down on your right.
well, where the fuck is he?
what's the plan?
you're what?
all i know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. the way i see it, brown here looks guilty.
how drastic?
what do we do?
you want the red or the white?
there were a lot of variables to consider --
oh, god! give me the fuckin' name!
someone should stay with mr. smith.  what if he wakes up?
what were italians doing living in greece anyway?
he must have.
look, i'm captain james west...
well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
heather? wha...
micmacs used to call it little god swamp.
anybody hungry?
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
he turned back into the room.  where have we seen it before.
of course you don't know anything about it. if you knew anything about it, i wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
he told me there could be only one.
what is it? kiddie porn again? sexual battery of a patient? i've had my license taken away in three states.
it was bad.
don't call yourself fat.
i'd just tell my sister, lena.
oh, right, right... 
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of...
you think it's simple, huh?
i'm bella.
gluck.
not on your feet too much?
sean, come on out, man. what, you forget your favorite uncle?
i don't think so.
the cockatoo inn.
where's the battery room for the hospital?
were you in nam?
make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, i warrant you.  do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in berlin.  the dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
saw who?!
hello?
and... and before that. did i do anything? anything bad?
murray said...
this night you shall behold him at our feast; read o'er the volume of young paris' face, and find delight writ there with beauty's pen; this precious book of love, this unbound lover, to beautify him, only lacks a cover: so shall you share all that he doth possess, by having him, making yourself no less.
thank you very much, deputy minister.
it'll be hell.
your parents would want you to be in bed.
why are there still such headlines?
nah, accommodation address.
what happened?
give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
oh, nick... nick!
guess what i am holding in my hand. you like guessing games?
king ain't gonna like this.
you know something? i’ve just seen so much ugliness i don’t think i’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  i’d hoped to have a private word with adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
you admit you're lying?
i had him in view. i was peeling over the egg, into a dive. he saw me when i moved in for the kill. there wasn't any danger...
you've done it again?
i don't know.  do <u>you</u> know...?
one minute to warp threshold...
i've been trying to nail george's for years, but he's very careful. i'll just keep having children. i think i'm pregnant, by the way.
oh my god . . . what the hell is . . .
you're kidding.
you tricked me - i wouldn't have - i've never - never
it's really fifties. you sort of clash with the world.
you and i are the same, darien. we're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
well... come on.
you're wife died.  you can't feel responsible for that.
you can go out there if you like...
i'm so sorry. obviously you haven't ... dr. carlson died.
it's a damn good role.
why did you do these things, donnie? did frank tell you to commit these crimes?
what's you last name?
okay.
well, i have to file a claim...
professor!
every geek here's got a thing for lisa. but that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  like that!?  this is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
you have to call the police...
well...i should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
and before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
i can explain ...  i was in the forest ... riding north from camelot ... when i got this note.
can i help?
yes.  i suppose so.  where?
thanks for the information.
so... i see you're still in the neighborhood.
oh man!  i could've gone all night without looking at that.
so what do we do about this creep?
ouch. how many?
i thought you wasn't comin'.
that the old actress -- julia farren?
to seek out new life and new civilizations. zephyr. cochran’s own words. when charles darwin set out on the h.m.s. beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
...this is your sweater, right?
slow, hon. but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here.
the whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
i hate the storm. i hate it!
kind that will help you find the answers, george.
my secretary saw you with that boy.
what did you say?
maybe...
have i ever told you the world is beautiful...  i'd really like to play nintendo with you, or something...
is the plaintiff ready?
but you said you liked men to use their hands.
you'd never been out of new york?
not a star-jumper.
what are you doing?
it's one of the world's greatest creatures.
oh, fie.  what about the unicorn?
oh, hi.
oh yes.  nineteen...just.  i'm cold.
can i have your name again?
game's over, eddie.
no. no, i'm serious. i'm not joking. i just like you. that's all.
sorry...  keep the column moving!..close ranks there!
he helped me out once.  that's all.
we'll lose them if they go in there.
you should think about this.
where?
you got elvis?!
so hang on. you're both nadia's cousins?
what are they doing now?
i know it was a bad idea to close the store.
my fault?!  if you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  do you have to rub my nose in it?
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
like clockwork.
another thing that baffles me, doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
tell me, how is jacqueline?
not exactly.
i just heard you.
jesus, i don't believe it.
oh, that's all.
hi!
that don't mean nothing.  iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
yes.
she up for this?
you did? a human ear?
you stop him?
the good lord works his revenge in strange ways.
so juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
thank you.
a couple of hours? why are you going up there in the first place?
what?
oh, really.
really? huh, i thought for sure you'd say lynette fromme. she's got that snooty vibe i know you dig.
how long are they going to hold him?
my man, how you doing?
???
i lack the authority, buckaroo banzai.
say, if you're stringin' me, old-timer ...
i'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
them.
visitors? some friends maybe? someone you talked to?
maybe if you'd come to the backers party, i would've gotten the money.
lord wessex, as i foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. it's time to settle accounts.  how much was the wager?
do you think anyone will really come here?
i didn't know that andrew was dead until mr. sattler called me at home that night.
allowing max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
i've got almost everything we need! and this nice man...
what?
i'm listening, sir.
that's my scientist.
last night's as much my fault as yours.  if he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
there it is!
one little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
you think i have a problem?
get out.
mr. cole?  my name is doctor railly. i'm a psychiatrist.  i work for the county -- i don't work for the police. my only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
who's colson, harry?
we'll be going to warp speed --
about sixteen hundred.
what about your agent? hear anything yet?
dancing?  i'm out here trying to strong arm steven reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  did she have a friend?
i can beat him.
getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
thank you, sir. thank you for your time.
well i don't want to do something like that.
the mark of a true killer.  sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
you feel nothing?
you are drunk.  you know, it's been a long time and i'd love to catch up, but i really got to -
but do you know that for sure without -
yes, sir.  what's up, general ripper?
frank, don't you have something to say?
well, i gu-guess they had it... comin'.
neighbor!  doctor!  i live across the hall.
keep it clean, rambo, or i'll nail your hide to the shed.
well, why should i?
it's a big and busy funeral home.
ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
then...
...they're sending me.  out to get shot.  hounding me.... they're... 
no, no, no...
you're jumping to conclusions.
ten.
i guess you know why you're here
and you're mine.
the late 20th century.
i guess that's why you go for hot lips houlihan.
you always carry a gun with you?
but, hey, maybe we can be friends.
i said that?  which word was "goat?"
come on!
hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
which one can i open first?
your guitar is named kimber?
-- i'll get in the back --
that's ridiculous.
of course.
but tor, it's a starring part! you're second billed.
we try something out. there's someone i'm in business with named ruiz. i want you to accompany him on a drop.  just as scenery. ruiz has his boys. i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. as a deterrent.
i don't think i like that guy's attitude at all. hey, you know what? take off the blades. i mean it. i'm gonna break your fucking legs. take 'em off.
how'd you get this?
few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. naturally, she misses her kids. six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
i lost it.  it's kind of muddy out there.
that was no earthquake.
you remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
down, honey, down.
now where were we?
yes. she bought my sister's business.
come on, it'll be fun.
lamar burgess thinks that you left john because he lost himself in precrime instead of you.
i know it's at the high end of our range --
from what i can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  there's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. the cops'll plow right into you.
we're living history here.
hypnos?
god, you're getting huge. how many months has it been now?
well... i can't think of anything.
i better go. you sure you're all right?  it's been a pleasure. sincerely.
done.  in fact, i was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
high school?
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila? we haven't even gotten naked yet!
wanna play some tennis saturday?
who knows?  maybe he's ordering army knives. i can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for fleming and marvosa.
what if someone else buys it in the meantime?
now i'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  okay. what do you smell?
oh for pete's sake, it's only a joke.
this was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. everyone in town knew him.
it's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
i can't.  they're following me right now.  they'll meet me there. they'll halo me.
she's passed on, kid.
go on with your dream. what was it that frightened you?
aye, but i still wonder how much.
hey, watch it!
i could like kill a guy with these things.
so... now what?  cattle call again?
she does look a little peaky.
okay.  up you go, mollie.
if you'd like.
i don't know.  i don't know who i am.
thank you...
it will end tonight.
i told you, i don't play well with others.
i know what you're doing.
you tried.
okay, i'll kill you when you change, i swear to god in jesus christ's name.
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
are you sure you're up to this, mr. case? we could reconvene tomorrow.
do you know what this is, frances?
do you think this is wise, boy? crossing blades with a pirate?
anyone?
will he *yield*?
...come on, man. okay, here's an idea. we'll stop outside of brainerd. i know a place there we can get laid. wuddya think?
a layman..., layman. interesting term. so many experts on government grants. and you say you're a 'layman?' but it was you who caught me, wasn't it, will? do you know how you did it'
thank you. verdell...  sweetheart?  by the way, thanks for saving me.
you up?
i'm meeting someone called natalie.
why should you be? after all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater-
--jeeeeeeesus--
where'd you clip this?
do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
alas, that love, so gentle in his view, should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
well, what do you know.
all right, gillis.  you've got five minutes.  what's your story about?
what's up?
no.
hey, okay.  look buddy -- i've got to go to work.
i'll say.
there.
no drinks . no movie. this is the last time i take a charter flight.
can you take me to color me mine?
you're my girl, aren't you?
uh-huh.
no.  why only --  oh --
don't worry about it.
no.
you expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
it's not over, brynner.
have you ever been there before?
viceroy of the west indies.
no more for me, thanks.  remember what i said.  i can't interfere with the law.
newt.  newt, wake up.
so long, kid.
i'm engaged.
i brought you a present. merry christmas.
it went down.  i filed it.
yours.
you mean you don't want to go?
that's what he said. jimmy.
always?
i need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
you're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
i don't have any.
this time they really mean to stop me.
then i called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
have they got midge up there?
you've made a wonderful impression. your views are liberal... it is easy to see you have an open mind.
i don't love you any more.
i don't know.
hello.
you got light fingers, everett. gopher?
do you ever see him?
listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
i dunno, toby. we really have a long way to go. you still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
direct hit. he's resetting his shield harmonics...
but it isn't bad weather now.
what?  i may lose it again? but i haven't found it yet! i'm sorry. goodbye!  yes?
should throw a great weight into the balance...
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy. unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
i'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  who should i tell him called?
they're already all settled in, frank. anyway, i'm sure annie wants her privacy.
well? what do you think of her?
look, the man may be a fellow vulcan, but that doesn't...
what's in there?
where're you off to now?
can we make this quick?  roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  again.
i don't know. this thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
there's a snowmobile. inside a day we could be on the yukon.  i got money there.  remember that five thousand?  make it ten.  be smart.  take it and walk away.
wait.
no. it's not that.
after eight years in the jungle with you, i know mrs. wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe!
aren't you?
don't fight.
tell me what in the hell's going on, elton!
and the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
i don't know who you are. i'd like to thank someone.
not just any carbohydrates, mind you. it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  we should get a strobe on this thing. maybe even a siren.
i'm a cop -- i notice everything. that drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when i left...
then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
oh, like i could do that?
well, i called erica's beeper. there's just no answer.
you know what i mean.  i'm getting married soon, but i haven't lived the life i want.
how am i supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
what a body, what a voice.
maybe it's time you got out.
no, you're stupid.  get going!  right now!  she's primed!
oh, come on - come on! we'll soon find the wizard!
you got a tab?
now, remember -- keep it simple.
can i be excused?  i'm not hungry.
your boy, there--
i don't wan to discuss work.
i can spare me...
the big house.
sure it wasn't. hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? don't raise your hands all at once.
we're moving through time.
candle wax.  car wax.  mustache wax? could be anything.  guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  gets sand in it.  wipes it off with a shoe.  shoe scuffs the counter.
m'hm.
who else knows about this?
why would you do a thing like --
you're kidding.
oh. guess i got the wrong impression.
com'on, tell me.
pg&e corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley.
likewise. and draw two for chasers.  now you're beginning to live.
and don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at '21.
what happened to number five?
ben did this?
are you wearing a uniform?
then what is it? is there somebody else?
yesterday.
i am also liaison between these two.
oh, shit.  i hate looking at that!
is this -- what?
please, continue.
is...is the movie!
goddammit, ray, we gotta get out of here --
the small ball.
look. i know i have a case. if you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
there sha ka ree is fabled to exist.
what kind of noises?
what?
they killed him, honey.
nothing.  i guess i just wanted to thank you.
what does it say? what hurts so much, bruce? what does the book say?
we'll see about that ...
but i'm the commander!
is there a phone booth there?
you don't know where you're going?
don't worry, i'm a new strain. and i don't give up. everything i've ever wanted i've had to work like hell for. well, how about it?
no, no, no. all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
anya... where are we?
he gets huge advances on his novels. he's going back to that.  you know how he hates it here.
sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. be reckless.
what else?  what else do you hear right now?
is this stool taken?
you ain't lying.
he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?
people die.
i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!
how come there's nothing out there? that stuff is all milk.
are you sure there's no mistake?
it's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
yes -- it is.
general anderson, the problem was the terrain. if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park...  we should be able to take him down.
yeah.
i don't think it knows it's torturing us.  it's just watching.
sarah -- with an h?
we're hung up here.  snagged.
i say we throw the switch and see what happens.
you and the other one, you're still billy's girls. you always were his girls...
i'm not asking you to believe me. you'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. you're all coming with me.
destroy the evidence huh.
you bet.  paid for a check-up for the whole family.  and not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  they just took care of it.  just like that.  we never even saw a bill.
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
can't you see it?
oh, no, actually. busy night.
back.  neck.  back.
i'm... discouraged.
this ought to be good.
and you chased one?
daddy, where's my money?
you gotta tell a story too, brian. it's fair. c'mon, don't think too hard --
i'm just finishing up, too.
you little bitch!
well, karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
try to keep it to a minimum.
good night, mrs. brett!
come on, now, i don't want to see you unhappy.
don't tempt me, i'll shoot!
i looked it up.
you see, i'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- i'm nervous -- i need somebody -- i don't know if you quite understand me. you said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and i mean --
come back here!
don't you understand?  i just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
what are you talking about?!  we just met an hour ago.
i mean wo-man.  how ya doin'?
i never asked you!
you were ready to bite that guy's face.
we have a baby?
why did she do it?
i need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  what i'm gonna do isn't very legal.
the only thing which exists is myself.
spare me.
beth, i didn't.  hold it together. alright?
this isn't for real.
now what kind of statue was that?
your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
he's got one!
you shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
to show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
something happens to my confidence.
he'll live. but it means your boy's behind it. astricky was holding a list. they just faxed it to us...
well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
oh, everything's the same size, same price.
shut up.  our fathers were our models for god.  and, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about god?
fuck, what's his name?
but what is it they don't like?
think she means for us to follow?
damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
she's cracking, norman.
how short the skirts are.
you go to hell.
you didn't
exactly.  it's the key.
i ruined? with all due respect, i told you to abort --
limos, huh?
how'd you know it was me?
eddie?
okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car --
i don't mind a parasite. i object to a cut-rate one.
i feel like the night before the first day of school.
quaid!  that's quaid!
drop some money.
check out baby big-head. that kid is scary!
dolores, give me your shoes.
i'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
the police called us.
when was the last time you saw sal?
how's the journal?
the invasion plans.
yeah. what do you want. life, right?  have you ever been to california?
maybe i can do something right.
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
okay.  what'd you spot...?
it's a mine, isn't it?
no, i'm sorry.  no, i didn't mean that.  no, i didn't mean that.
well, flea, i appreciate the respect you just showed me.  but i don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  it's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
what the hell...
c'est tres amusant... you have been promoted. and to a jew... i am joking of course. naturellement. seriously, nick, may i hope that you have come to play?
jesus.
greg, it isn't a wild tale. it's true. if there were only some way --
oh, i wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
i'm not going!
maybe i like garbage.
i'm going to be number thirty-two, like magic.
now go kiss your daddy, quick.
you're doomed. i'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. right there in that tub.
yes, sir!
i don't like the sound of that.
john, i've got to tell you, i think you're about used up.
you'll never make it.  you've out- smarted yourself.
maybe he'll get tubed.
hi, lydia.
things were done. nobody was spared...
now, now, darlin'... jack just needs to know what business he's in.
vital signs have stabilized. that's good.
he still does.
i'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
i mostly work from home. i'm a composer.
are you embezzling?
a hacker planted the virus.
pardon me while i reach for my beads.
would you come in here, please?
i left the gate open and otis got out! he could get hit by a car!
so you're not so smart after all.  i want you to know--if it ever came to it-- i'd be willing to get an ovum from the egg bank.  in fact, i'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
chief...it's like none of this exists. i'm sorry.
yes, yes, but that's --
me and wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
really, sail, i'll be okay.
the telephone? it continues to ring.
no.
where's she work?
you're welcome, unc.
emil???!
mr. whale?  are you all right?
college!
if another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
meaning what?
he said he'd be at the gas station at six.
you killed those other two.
friends never break promises, do they?  okay.  here.  now listen.  there are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  you understand that?  they said i could come in and bring you out.
i don't understand!
and?--and?--
yeah.  cia-level stuff...
and thanks for the cloak invisible!
wait. i'm sorry. you're right. eight years is a long time. can i offer you a cup of tea?
what was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
am i right?
that word is special. that word is only for something really important. now, repeat after me... bugger off.
what do you believe in then?
i'm afraid master dick has... gone traveling.
i don't know. the truth, maybe.
would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
hi, i'm dick nixon.
tell my dad i'm sorry about the watch.
ha! did ya see that!  hey, cheswick!
mr. boone.  you're not due to cut the lawn until wednesday.
but you might.
... do you think we should look for him?
got no plans, rayburn, nothing on. just wanted to see you, how you were. came by on impulse.
not even the birds sing sweet as you.
how the... did he get in there?
i wanted to apologize, susan --
i detest violence, but ... christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
did you know the contractor?
happy now?
and you... are you not also afraid?
i thought i could handle it. i didn't want to bug you. i thought i could handle it on my own, but i couldn't. she's in real bad, auggie.
yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. it's absurd.
i'm holding for lieutenant beldere!
remembers what?
ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
but i gotta go now. i've got to go be johnny.
harry, we spoke with martin.
okay.   how much?
is her pain sporadic or constant?
newt time then can walk right up and knock.
one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
what does that fucking mean?
itta bena, now, uh, that would be...
i'm the only left, dick.  if you don't talk to me, you ...
you sure? it's my favorite shirt, mind if i check?
you're all right, argyle.
you know what gets me?
you've done well, scottie. you're good at your job.
we know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  we know that no ant can be an individual.  no <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
why didn't you just go along with townsend.  get rid of me.  i would've...
i stay here because i am happy.  is that such a terrible crime?
and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
how about if next week some time i put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
you remember nothing?  who you are? what you've done?
"dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
trying not to be. trying to jump ship.
did you request this case?
raise shields! energize phasers, stand by to --
approximately? one thousand bucks.
i used to be married to one.
you weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, ray. you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit. these regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to the graveyard, to indian country. i need you behind me, ray. not pulling against me.
well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
charley.
i don't like you.
and if they succeed, humans won't make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow.  as first officer i should be the one beaming down...
go ahead, be my guest.
no you are not.  you're sally nash. listen to me, you're sally nash.  you're my best friend and i love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "oh now i'm a novelist, oh now i'm a director..." english prick bastard joe therrian who's probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway.
not everything is an illusion.  my hand... wasn't that real?
what, vincent?  this is me, doll.  i know you.  what did you think you were doing?  running to the cops.  hiding out. no, no.  you're sorry now, aren't you?
let thy thoughts be guided
you really should go in, it's marvelous.
what'd he say?
just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
...so call if you need me.
them's the breaks, right?  no war stories for this pup.
to be the wife of a poor player?--can i wish that for lady viola, except in my dreams? and yet i would, if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
only brother.
shut up!
so, zuzu.  are you okay?
your mother's family is spanish?
i wasn't born yesterday. i'm hurt, and i'm hurt bad.
medallions.
oh my god, look! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh?
i understand.
there's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
they do not! and they don't leave it behind them. a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
cause i don't get it.
yeah, and he's strangling me...
you okay, man? you okay?
commander, these are some of the most famous people in starfleet! admiral kirk, my god!
that’s it?  that’s all i get?!  a glare?!
no!  i'm not going any further! it'll wreck my car.
no, no! maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. and guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
i took her out a couple of summers back.  scared the hell out of some cows.  -- i wonder if she'd make it down to antarctica.
you don't know what you're getting into here.
mom?  you're alive...
you’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. where is the austrian?
he killed a man worked for him the other night.
that's puttin' it mildly.
really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  heard some bad things.
c'mon help me in. i'll open the front door.
y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. i told you to stay beside me.
i was, but no... yes... i was before, but now i'm not. it's irrelevant, really. the idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. but i'll tell you something, until about five months ago, i really enjoyed my work.
long ago...
and the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till i've passed on. maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after i'm gone.
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago?  twelve bodies on board.
you want me to hunt them for you.
you don't wanna know, chick, you don't wanna know.  those guys been in here?
so that's cool with you, then?
it's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on cable here.
we'll die if we stay here!
they found us!  everybody out!
emergency transmitter?  all your gear is back at wilder's.
you never know what's over the horizon, data. before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
i hope you make your peace with jabba.
god damn you gale weathers! don't you see? the killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! ben damon's character was the first one to get offed. so was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling's candy, and now me!
who, buddy?  yeah.  he's a good guy. back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  she's a born-again christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
and you're beautiful...
here's the paper on the brooklyn job.  she paid with a visa card.
don't you like her?
i'm sorry, katharine.
a long, long, long, long, while.
i've done a few things but i'm not a murderer, mr. mckenna.
and he never hit you before?
no.
josh and i are going to south coast. wanna ride?  maybe see a movie?
jack, must you go?
hopefully sooner than later.
beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  we can do some great logging up here.
don't you think there's too much gold?
we're just burnin' light here.
i think i'm dying . . .
well, he told me to collect cash.
no!  oh no!  three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! the police won't even go in there any more.
miss kreutz, please... i'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
it's astonishing - and incredible, but—
thank you.
you killed my daughter.
no, sir. radar.
drink.
ass like your, i can see why he's worried you'll punk.
wally thinks apples are boring.
give it back.
would you like me to leave...?   is this a bad time --?
what're you gonna do?
angelo and buster.
that's right.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? you think <u>i'm</u>...  ... gay?
it's the only way.
it's true then?
my wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. as you may have noticed.
isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
goin' far?
what?
sir?
all right, stupid question. but don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
jack, she's a fucking waitress in buellton. how would that ever work?
i sent two units.  they're bringing her down now.
the who?
mio caro adone.
so the slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery.  i'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  okay, next step -- i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night.
hiding him where?
yes. from the highest authority. there are two conditions. the u.n. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
god no. i'm a hairdresser.
what?
and let my cry come unto thee.
you leave me no choice.
did i ever tell you about me lay marston?
i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
all i knew, she was pulling away. it made me crazy.
bruce? oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
bombers.
and you?
what?
did you see what the first bank stock opened at ? very impressive.
i know. i'm sorry...
what does that mean?
or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
i think you're quite handsome.
i thought you said it was just a blade.
space stattion 5 - lounge
you better get up there, sir. we're having some power fall-off...
well, i thought you understood and i was just missing it.
what do you mean "brought it bowling"? i didn't rent it shoes.  i'm not buying it a fucking beer.  he's not gonna take your fucking turn, dude.
... you can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... i don't know, what's the point of having it all. look at me. i don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam lyndon johnson!
ojichan? akira ojichaan dewa naino? koko de nani shiteru no?  
from interpol?
alex!
just hold-on there --
you drive a hard bargain, mr lombard.
do you think you are a real master?
sunday, but...
sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
yeah?
can i help with anything?
tell us about him.
during sex.
you.
i'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
i've changed the front page a little, mr. bernstein.  that's not enough - there's something i've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  i've got to make the "new york enquirer" as important to new york as the gas in that light.
no! well, yes, but
maybe you ought to see a doctor.
no.
cynthia! sure.
let's teach these vermin a few manners.
do you need a tagamet?
i did exactly what you told me. i went to		   * dodd and i said that i didn't have				* jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this teddy must have taken everything.
so what's the question?
you ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
i'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! i push things about, but i've little say what happens to them.
how can you be sure?
hey!
i been immobile.
it's so cold.
... shoelaces?
oh, shit!
i've been working.
we're very close!  because of you!
when i was a naive young recruit in spain, i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  i now understand: it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  to our women.
sorry.
doing what?
not exactly. just thought i'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  you know the next investigation we get into i hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. this one has been nothing but climbing stairs. and when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
her master's voice!  i must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
just everything.  you.  california.  the beach.  this spot right here.  i feel like i belong here, you know?  it just feels right.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
yeah, i'm here.
i think we hit the honeypot, boys.  there's something brewing under the street.
honest, mr, charles.  i never touched that safe.  them bonds that were missing... julia took them.
straight up?
you're a regular einstein, aren't you?
where to?
a gentleman would offer water.
i'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
i told you about the pumpkin didn't i?
no! let go, snorri!
and, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, alexander.
and i have mine.
he does this every year?
maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
&lt;&lt;it was smaller than that. sharper.&gt;&gt;
it's running three meters down. twenty knots.
i almost forgot....
sure. this girl said...
i'm okay.
it's nothin' like that.
what do you mean??
what's so fucking funny?
in a week.
it had this red spot on its back.
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator. 
i think i'm going to give it all up.
either you're a member of the club or you aren't, elton.  tell me what you know...
i like what you've done with it. when's captain nemo moving in?
i think i love you, mate.  how do you know so much about so much?
okay. i'm on the bridge.
times are bad, mr. potter. a lot of these people are out of work.
but, but but but...
ol' satchel-butt...
so that's a maybe?
if you don't mind driving, i'd like to take you as my guest.  there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
what were you doing at finlay's this morning?
let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the lord for all this--
darryl.  he's alright, kinda corny.
i think we're lost.
i don't know. he's kind of a mook.
did you have a dream?
we are almost out of water.
but you can't give back to them, will.
i'll think about it.
hey, sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
yes. it would be.
show me the other one again.  i like them both.
sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine fury.  and it turned out to be you. at last.  i appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. that's why i desire them.
i knew i could count on you.
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
the websters.
ok. this is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
why not?
you've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
what say we get the hell out of here, ellen brody. ...
hey, if you live another week i'll be impressed.
look at all that silverware.
yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
i guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
-- well it was very hot so i'd left the door open and the water was running so i didn't hear him come down the stairs...
why don't you go?  you should sleep.
no, i don't think that's very much fun. let's play house instead.  you be the friend who comes to see me.  i'll show you my children.
another favor... get me banking info on jordan kalfus. u.s. deposits or withdrawals. thanks. oh, get me the same on samuel ramos.
i won't be able to.
if you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, i'd be glad --
i guess i started smokin' when i was about six... my mama was already dead from lung cancer...
i ain't got nothing but them books.
are you married?
give it up.  if you threw yourself-
wander about.
now just a minute...
it's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. you're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>show</u> your affection.
you're right!  we'll take a trip. a trip is what we'll take.  i don't want to talk about motorcycles.  i don't want to talk about tits.  go home!
did she tell you anything?
charlie, what do you think of richard norvik?
do you?
you can save it for the jury, charles. i want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, i'm a bad lawyer.  gentlemen.  counselor.
you loved her, didn't you. well, so did i.  you'll have to admit she had four husbands.
talk to the pipe, mrs. peel. that usually helps. don't worry about me being invisible. other than that i'm perfectly normal.
he's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of macy's. he's using you. only you're too blind to see it.
have you told anyone that i'm here?
do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. in fact, you don't normally approach girls, am i right? the truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if i'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
how many times do i have to say it?  i didn't put the hit on little eddie... never had anything against that kooky chimp.  i actually found him, "endearing."
brad, can i talk to you a minute?
i presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
yes.
we choose to believe it.
he had to come quickly.  it was a big leak.
can you move over a wee bit?
you a blue-moon fool.
-build the bridge over the tsavo river. and be finished in four months time. can you do that?
what is it?
i'm not going to do it.
... you've quite a sense of humor, mr. chance - but all kidding aside, may i ask just what you are doing here?
did she ask about me?
uh... hey baby. are we like, doing it?
there's what they're waiting on!
it is also a place of burial.
we haven't seen you since... i'm terribly sorry.
call me later.
are you alright?  what is it?
that <u>is</u> incredible!  you know, i had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
so where do you know alan from?
evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  if i don't come back, i don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
i used to love this place. i used to take kathy reynolds down here.
they gave her the wrong anesthetic.
weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
word must have got all the way to texas by now.
no. no. it's too good a story.
no, you wouldn't let me.  and i don't want to go...
hmm!
well, he's still running the show, ain't he, dad?
shhhh. time to say goodbye.
i sure know that feeling.  terrific work today.
howdy.
does that mean you don't like me?
--almost every source we've used has been republican, this guy's a card- carrying democrat.
we'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
but there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
the break up value is higher. it's worth 80.
envelopes?							    *
i'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
i won't be held responsible.
hi daddy. i know what happened.
i forgot all about aaron.  i promised to stop by and see how he did.
jennifer can stay and look after kevin
i suppose all this is leading somewhere?
unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. it's harder playing detective now.
he hasn't called back.
mary clarence -- you're alive!
i don't know, mon. the food lines took forever.
don't bring it home in this.
do you know what he's talking about?
and when is the countdown supposed to expire?
all i want is thirty-nine sixty. if you'll give me a check i'll get out of this place. it gives me the jitters.
how?
are you cold? would you like a blanket?
i'm holding your hand!
zero's a number right?
least, <u>they</u> won't feed any comanches this winter...killin' buffalo's as good as killin' injuns in this country.
yes -- that all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
i was in the area, and i thought you might like to have lunch.
yes -- that's true.
oh, jesus!!
well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
that's up to your guy on the boat.  seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. make sure he got it right.
you are.
i'm going to get it right this time. going to get it set up and get off it for good.
just checking up on your family.  i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.
so you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? well, here we are, what do you think? pretty fucking pathetic huh? kind of like one of those documentaries on educational tv?
divorced.  remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in sausalito.
i was first to respond.
a mortician.  he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
the girl could use some help.
this signal's weird...must be some interference or something. there's movement all over the place...
she fucked me too.
do you want to see themis and manto butchered?  if i die fighting commodus he won't care about you. if i live i'll come and get you.
anymore ideas...?
let me go! let me go!!
meaning?
sorry to have bothered you.
your equipment has crapped out again....
what's my name?
and some problems cannot be settled without one.
hey, jack, how ya doin'? what took you so long to call, man? i been waitin' ... i'm at vroman's up in the fillmore. yeah, vroman's... 'course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
sit down!
get way.  you'll see when i'm ready. first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how i lay awake at night worrying--
and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.
i'd better only get two. how about the lobster thermidor?
i want you to hang up the suit. and i want you to stay away from vicki.
no, i'm good.
you did create me.
have you ever seen the sun, erik?
nigger, get real. you touch jayne kennedy she'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -
will ya look at her!
that's how it's done. you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
no one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
take it easy, though.
baaa, got no time to go to the movies. love and hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
because.
lord's name.
the jolly nigger bank.
mr. kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus.
she run off with a drummer one night. durin' prayer-meetin'.
who are you calling, sis?
if i don't see it in front of me, you're right. it ain't shit.
and you still reach for your piece every time.
givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  asshole.
you don't go after the local scrunch?
...and they sit down right next to me...
no, i don't really think you're a freak.
what --
grandma!
my band.
wallet, cash, i.d...
are you sure?
who is he?
i've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. but what you're doing now, does. i don't know why.
love me?
mason, uhm, john, i have something to tell you.  you know that pardon= contract you signed?
what?  what's wrong?  how will this help us get off the island?
that sounds pretty interesting...
the bar at the hotel? she told you that? what did she say exactly?
i don't believe this is happening to me.
your research laboratory is most impressive...
spiro t. agnew was vice president, i believe.
i get the feeling, falco, that you're always snooping around...
listen to me i --
but with this place, i - - i wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  an aim devoid of  merit.
nyah!
yeah.
i'll repeat the experiment.  i will hold the truth. that's the only thing that matters.
can he smell the difference, eh?
how did the fire fight end?
a man doesn't always mean the things he says.
you will or you'll be back at bet so quick you'll never know what hit you.  i need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  it will be on the fast track.
do you know her?
who are you?
like in a church painting. i see this giant hovering over the ground. he's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
theo, buzz is dead.
all i ever wanted was to sing to him. that's his doing, isn't it? he gave me that longing - then made me mute. why? tell me that. if he didn't want me to serve him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? go on, tell me! speak for him!
maybe he's just - waiting...
give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
then you've heard too.
did dignan take the test?
what?
lee, wait a second.  it's not worth it, man.  he's making you do this.
take a top coat.
-- oh, sure. a hairdresser. how... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
c'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
cia?
what do we do now?
why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
objection!
where is the play?
i'm not easily shocked.
guess the capital of brazil --
doyle, you're awful. you shouldn't be that way.
what's wrong.
this is what we do?
i'm kenny's aunt lisa.
we can't change the day and the night, alexander.  this is the world.
best everything, joe.  but i'm going to dance with you.
i'll mention it upstairs.
the kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
but wait, you don't understand-
it's not my father's money, it's the foundation's.  why did he think you had it?  and who does?
planes mostly. may take a crack at rickshaws. how does the direct approach work over here?
with all due respect to merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. but he has no right to stop others.  ever hear of the first amendment?
what?
not for long, richard. you got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
oh, sure. now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. you were completely innocent -
himself?
can you fill me in here?
what's the fight about? that's her fiancee, isn't it? are they blaming him?
how long does he have?
you haven't time.
then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was dumb or something?
yeah, chef -- go ahead -- take lance with you --
you shouldn't have talked to norbert that way.
hey, ted, sorry. i didn't know your family was in the garage when i set it on fire!
what about him?
i don't know how you cope, grace. three kids, army pay. on your own.
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all. she's just a crazy old woman. hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  wasn't much right before that, neither.
six twenty-seven in the morning... but the money?
to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
no.
she saved our lives.
no gentleman would do that.
calendar for the day. you'll find the senate manual in the drawer. anything else you want, just snap for a page.
you know how to box?
no.  at least, i didn't until i came up here.
did you hear what i said?
i see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
i-i couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
no, gale, i'm just getting started. seeya soon.
it doesn't matter. the publicity's the main thing.
now... did you answer cause you thought that's what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
you coming in?
why on earth should you be so depressed?  have you heard some of the things they've been saying? you can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
is he really all right?
colonel jarrod, i'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
you went into the cells --- and you changed them.  how...?!
it is not beautiful.
just tell me if anything weird happens.
does everything have to have a point?
goodbye, paul.
yes.
how long?
a turkish brothel.
you're precious to me, rose.
go to lunch, george.
say it.
she's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
it's got a green dot on its back. i can't go to sleep with it watching me.
heather?
maybe he lives in this, this belvedere, ohio, too! maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-up and talk about the choir. but then -
can we dream?
who am i?
oh no, my friend...
up yonder. see the lights?
treadstone.
oh -- too bad. did you quarrel? 
one of the plagues on members of congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. get my son into west point--or *outta* west point. i've got a scheme to put people to work. how do i get rid of cockroaches? some woman's composed a hymn to replace the star spangled banner. want to hear it?
leave him alone, miss ilsa. you're bad luck to him.
looks very solid, lilly. sit down. take a minute, tell me about it.
how?  how can you see anything?
i just saw her.
goddamn it, sean, you listen to me or i will kick your ass, do you hear me?
she says she's rose dewitt bukater, right? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic. at the age of 17. if she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
pull back.  you can't make the jump.
nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. crafty old sod.
it's far too dangerous.  zordon would never allow it.
you know what i'm talkin' about.  all that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
but it is being used, isn't it, father?
new wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th century, i think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. the vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
that's impossible! it was ruint when i got here! you ruint my life!
how's the weather down there?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions.
sure. .
you two sees like a perfect fit.   only two mounths...?
i'm happy.
what do you want for sam?
because it just isn't a business, that's all!
oh you do, look.
and that, my lord, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.
it should take me twenty minutes. where are you coming from?
there's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
that's superstition. that's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- i'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
aiiee.  more waiting?  i don't know if i like this plan.
no. kisses to you.
what're you doing?
well, what is this?
you probably know the type. you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. they always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. they dress and enamel themselves with great care. they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell.  tell me about yourself, miss mayfield.
i just haven't seen you like this in a while.  i'm used to seeing you more sedate.
listen bo. this is very important. everything people have written about in science books is going to change. the history of the world's future is on the tv right now. we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  for your children bo.
oh, they insisted on following me.
i read george jean nathan every week.
that's easy. me.
no —— not yet.
fuck him karras!!! fuck him!!!
what is all this shit?
i was impressed.
i think it was a little more complicated than --
jonah!
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? it's not original. it's something i picked up from the chink.
you must leave?
ten flights?
what is that to you...?
uh-huh. you could’ve waited for me inside.
no.  i think my film is perfect for you.
--and that mr. marsh paid less attention to you?
then what is he doing?
nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler--can't remember how it turned out..
i sure hope this isn't permanent.
well--good night.
i'm going to get it for him.  whoever the mole is, i think goes by the name of job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the noc list, he'll find me.
i heard.
yes, i would!
how do i know you won't keep them all?
it's no use, dad. i practically threw myself at him. 
they're worth less points.
i said what time is it?  how long was i out?
how can he embarrass you?
hold on --
heaven?
the irish representative?
she'll forget about us eventually.
if the house is empty again, i don't know --
it's important.
i hope you like it. it's a marquis cut, 1.5 carats. they had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  letty?
oh, yeah. well i almost always beat captain rob.
robert...
hold still. why?
you called it in?
jack foley.  you've probably heard of me.
we must take action on this immediately.
that's sick.
try this.  i found a great jar of it. olive oil.  in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
the four noble truths, as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are: the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering.
i've just been to see mrs. marsh. georgina is doing splendidly.  the incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
it doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
fossils, huh?
just make yourself comfortable.
i forgot to bring the champagne, mr. johnny.
it feels good because: if you do as god does, enough times, you become as god is: powerful...
having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
there. that's right.
i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot...
i doubt it.  who's your friend?
does that mean we can't...
machines do not eat message.
sounds risky to me.
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away?
sustained.  yes.  the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
i saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
no, i mean you can do it from the cockpit.
well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
exactly. 'cept this gillette guy. he gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. meanwhile, the king sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door.
really? wow! that's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
we're not saying anything about that night to the police. we should all forget that night.
but with compassion and insight--
well don't you think that's odd?
you're going to be fine.
none of your business. or mine for that matter. i got nothing more to say.
why didn't you support her? you're the worst of the lot.
yes. it will double our range.  i know at least a dozen ways to get horses. all cheap.
people gonna walk into this place and say, "ola, hijo!  that some crazy wallpaper.  whew...it wild! is that a jackson pollack?"
mr. kane...  come right in...please...have a seat.
if a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
i asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
how was the funeral?
maybe. i don't know. seems more likely becker does, but at the very least she knows how i died.
he's killed closer.
it's his work.
fabulous!
mr. parker.
any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
a shelter?!  i’m the richest guy in the building...i’ve got twice the square footage you have!
you know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
i'm thirty.
why can't you be my champion?
we'll steal somethin' to eat.
no. don't be. i really enjoy hearing that. you're a terrific assistant.
do i get to kiss her too?
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you.
come down.
and the food sucks, i know.
i looked in his car. he's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
hey! what are you guys doing in here?
there's no question.  you don't have any.
tuttle! are you from central services?
what would your - boyfriend - think?
you see, karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. he couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. but, his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said. and she made sure karl knew. you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
because i'm at the edge of my capabilities, robert.
ah, stifler's mom!  thank you for letting us have a great party.
that is miss sherwood now. marge sherwood.
it's a damn postal truck!
what happened?
hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
what's that supposed to mean?
johnny, my dad's home today.
here's my problem, jack.  you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time?
what have you done?
hey, mick!
not likely, convict.
yes, it's been a long time ...
that thunder's sure somethin'.
what good'll that do? smoke's as bad as birds.
thanks, but i have my own now.
by the way, how'd you end up in shanghai?
about yourself?
yep. mitch and the little girl.
i hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters, ray. i don't know about uranium, i don't know about red dog table -- all i know is we did our job. it's over.
...make some trips into the city. sometimes, overnight.
ahm... room service.
there's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. food's shot to hell.
no, not at all.
do you know him well?
it might save some of the pieces, jeff. it would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. might blow over, this way.
we've come a long way since homecoming.
what?
but i could be anybody.
i'll be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?
uh oh.
mozart -
well, those are the breaks.
i surrender --
yeah?
where is she now?
but you know it already. why must i tell you?
i've read official estimates but i wouldn't bet my house on them.  i've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers.  at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
alexis! do you know what you are saying?
carry on.
ester and me did;  my niece picked then. she's just here from california.
as you see.
"at a special session of the general assembly, 178 countries voted to censure superman. with only columbia abstaining." ross that fella's becoming a public menace.
he's a ghost!
did she get my double burger?
then how come matt and i showed up as guilty ?
that's ridiculous.
i'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
scottie, why are we here?
we're not gonna have pie and punch!
hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  it's not a map, max. it's our balls. you know what i mean...  ...i gotta get laid man, i don't know 'bout you guys, but if i don't get it on soon, i'm... i'm not gonna make it.
tit for tat--as simple as that.
...now that's aggravating.
well, spats colombo - if i were saw one.
no, dignan. i'm sorry. i can't do that.
god.
well, i do barbara rush.
hey.
did you kill her?
man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. viagra ain't working.  my back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  but check this out.  i got to lay some ground rules.  your my family and i love you.  you're welcome to anything you want in my home. but i don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
whattaya mean?
the man following me has a walkie- talkie. if he sees i'm not here he'll call his partner. i do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
you got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
no.  i mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  you ever read the bible?  it talks about our sinful nature, you know?  i mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  it's evil. it's inside us.  it's what we are.
all street mimes should be executed.
okay.
zat true?
how come you took your own car?
done.  bring it to me in london.  i want it by the end of the week.
you'll see her die, that's all. they're mortal, despite what she told you.  she will die.  then what will you do?
it's too late... we already tested it on organa major.  it appears your data never got through.
king tut's tomb....
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight.
another?  how many times have you saved his life in this year alone? three?  four?
oh my god, that was good. where'd you learn all those new tricks?
awwww. worried about my feelings, are you? well, there's a new twist.
but you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
hello.
rough day?
can you remember our father?
fucking grifters! i love it! you got balls, i'll give you that much.
well, it's the funny man. give it here, package boy.
so. this is the guy you been waiting for. man of your dreams.
that's pretty good.
all right. at a quarter to five.  say, why don't we get married in marseilles?
yes.
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
ready to rock?
hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
oh-
i should maybe talk to you.
how may i help you?
revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? i bought into it ten years ago. it was my first real estate deal. i sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. it was better than sex. at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world...  now, it's a day's pay ... i had a mole in wildman's employ. gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
eight.
i think we may as well sit down.
mommy, if your real name's jackie and i call you mommy; and rachel's real name's rachel...then when i see her do i say hi stepmommy?  and if my name's ben, how come you don't call me son?
what do you think you're doing ?
where've you been riding, lance?
see this. solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. probably worth thirty.
is that a birthday cake?!
kelvin, you awake?
hey look.  you think i'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  just cause we hit it big.  luther, i owe you everything.  if you hadn't taught me con, i wouldn't know nothin'.
what's your record at?
how can you watch this crap?
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
what? is she having some secret affair with josh?
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant burgel.  if indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
you two faced bastard. i knew you were full of shit.
uhh, it's nice to meet ya. uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
no, see -
how comes it your are not afraid?
what am i supposed to do?!  i saw one of my oldest friends get killed! and i saw who did it!  i can't just -- "let it go away"!!
the name's reno.  this here's perfect tommy.
don't shine me, verbal. no more stalling. you know what i'm getting at.
george... look me in the eye... george, you don't ever lie to me again.
just kidding.
hello, mr. m.
that's 'fronkonsteen.'
uh, no, the shrimp puffs are holly's.  i do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  so there you were--
they want me. doesn't it make you proud?
ready for fuchsmachen???
another? but that's too soon! tomorrow night? it's impossible! did he say a hundred?
what has the old fool got himself into now?
because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at christmas?
i will close.
joker here. can we talk?
i'll kiss the baby for you.
i see.
want the wagon unloaded, clay?
you're absolutely right.  you forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  but it wouldn't matter. sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  i don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
uh-huh. adam?
yes, goddammit!
is she running a temperature? what is it?
what's the point of this?
she's dancing with me.
you're too late.  say bye-bye birdie.
where you got in the shower.
you're not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
yes, i know, but jurek, jurek...
you won't go to galbraith with me?
what would you say, too fast...too quick...
of course.  the entire royal family will be there to honor you.
sure.
no thank you, you crazy old woman.
you're coming with us.
home.
didn't he tell you about blind pete?
good evening, neighbor stone.
<u>i</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
let's hear from you, you goddam yankee. be nice to see you some time.
i don't need any new ties. i've got another tie - i've got another one besides this one. and it's a pip, too. there's only one thing wrong with it. you know what that is?  it has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. of course that's only in its weaker moments. when you move down to my place, i'll show it to you.
well, maybe. but i'd hate to be doin' it. takes more nerve than i got.
go tell your father we're eating.
why did you take the back roads here?  they're not safe.  you'd know that if you'd planned.
yeah, i uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
goodnight, kringelein. 
daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  go after crooked bookkeepers.
where are they?  shopping together?
i can't believe that we're eating cantonese.  is there no szechuan up here?  hunan?
he looks sad. do you whip him?
...you're gonna punch in a kitten later.
oh, no, ray. not tonight. spanky's not happy with you.
what would you call her?
anybody have a cigarette?  but seriously, do me a favor and concorde me back to prison.  i don't care anymore.  i hope you have the receipts for the threads.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..wallis, the shares outstanding are..
'trustafarians?'
how 'bout i give you to three, then i organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. one...
...he's a good man...
you like kids?
he's not home, i tell you!
everything okay?
you see the play? you've seen the play every performance?  but, don't you find it - i mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
lois, take kent there and introduce him around
where are you going?
maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
enough jabber.
oh, come on, man. tell me you wouldn't love it!
me like-y.
no, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
one more time.

you got a secondary search and you had a gun.
commander powell is dead.
you didn't know?
and now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
sid fletcher.
no.  but, as you can see, i'm having some work done on it.  you found a real treasure for me, terri.  i hope i can show you how grateful i am.
it's all right -- i don't think tex does, either.
how's loomis?
it's always stood there, miss connell.  i can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. i'm afraid it will have to remain.
my boy's special, well how about that. i knew you were different.
and would you describe those years as happy?
maybe i was hiding.  for years, i never told ben the one important thing.
you are wonderful!
look at foley! can you believe it!
ya know, doc, you could have folled me.
they ran away.
yes, yes, it's all arranged. everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. and the best part is: the trip returns you to new york.
all right, martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
yours... is... the superior...
no, no, we haven't the time. talk prose. where is my play?
bravo!  what about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  do we let them go too?
okay.
yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
no speech?
you need six.
don't.  i don't like that. what do you want?
it's too...
hi, john.
well, uh... great.
merrick...
the other working.

i'm afraid of nothing.
anna--
oh shit.
is there <u>anything</u> we can do?!
real times.
big v jack vincennes!  may i have this dance?
r.l., you gonna have to get on. i can't have nobody round my place.
no, i don't remember anything. it looks like i... but... i don't remember.
oh, i don't know. i mean look around. isn't this a fun place?
i go backpacking a lot. lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
truman, you know, i did think about moving away one time.
as in "death, where is thy sting?" he killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
you're very naive, major.  don't they say they want disarmament?
where's elvis?!
a dick, man!  and let me tell you something: i dig your work. playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
but as much as they loved her...
damn --  yes -- i --  -- i'm just a little tired. listen, elaine, viktor and i -- it's strictly a working relationship.  we could never be anything else.  we're just so... different.
can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
can't you like just divine it?
i left town. i didn't leave you.
save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain

i'm sorry, erin.
it was feyd?  it was feyd!  where is the ducal signet ring?  i must have his ring.

put her on.
mr. pope! mr. phillips! welcome, george bryan! james armitage!  sam! my pretty one! are you ready to fall in love again?
does that worry you?
her blood is all over the bathroom. i'd say that's a bit of a dna problem.
what is it?
target their bridge.
well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  we're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
i don't think it works if we're somebody else.  you know what i mean?  gary and celeste, jesus, what do they know about anything?
the scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. then you can travel -- i'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
okay.
thirty-seven!
uh-huh.
bala, that -- that lake we found -- i think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  that's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
i'm impressed.
from a -- girlfriend.
i said the record is destroyed. the original report exists for all time.  i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
yeah, dad.  i really did.  what am i gonna do?
are you open?
clearly, i am here, but only as an individual, i'm not the attorney of record.  mr. rafferty has that position. whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, i have nothing more to say.
kelly.  is suzie there?
uh-huh.
[two and a half! the rest was paper! strips of paper!]
jack!  it's christmas!

mr. president, how the hell did you get on board?
you'll find i'm full of surprises.
count on our help, sir.
i promise.
your dad taught you everything.
i almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  tell me, tell me, radio raheem, to turn my music down. didn't even say please.  who the fuck he think he is?  don corleone and shit.
i told him i was in the bathroom and i'd call him right back. what the hell was i supposed to say buddy, you got me into...
this cannot be.
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him? how could you do this?
well, i don't know, i may be doing some traveling this summer. i don't know how much i'll be around...  but i'll give you a call sometime.
you gotta stop smoking ..
you heard him.  i'm a star!
no, i am.  yes, i'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning.  i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and mr. wayne's hoped-for investment... i've studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and --
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones.
i made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
hello dwight.
they'd look silly on me.  i'm fourteen years old!
higher mathematics.  two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
i have ideas.
in anticipation of making you sick.
hello.
real courage. that's what we want.
-me, my god, it's a great day!
do you think i haven't noticed ... do you think i wasn't aware of the drift? oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
exactly what i was --
why not? but that's not how things wound up. i'm with lenny, lenny's your friend. and there it ends.
good, flatish land with reliable water, why? i don't have money. what are you about?
they could kill you.
how's your shoulder?
i'm already free...
he's out there. he's out there playing sitting bull with us. i want the motherfucker so bad i'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
we could really use some coffee --
what'd you guys find?
mommy, i'm scared.
mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. she's embarrassed to tell me. so why don't you tell me?
what about his girlfriend?
well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
this isn't our area. whose area is this --
i hear you.
i see.   a master criminal.
no digging joseph. the churchyards are too well guarded. we will "burke" them,
reiben, i don't know what i'd do without you.  sarge, keep ryan close to you and alive.
and it's not the first one!  they say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
i'm a solid man.
yeah.  well...i think it is important for you too.  sit down.
you think he saw us?
no, no! give it to me!
that was really bad, wasn't it?
oh.
why not call for help?
that was his favorite toast.  i saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  you placed first out of twenty-three.
you want to be a bounty hunter. why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
maybe not. but you're not telling me everything, are you?
funny, i was just thinking you should do the same.  since i am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  and best of luck in all your future endeavors.
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you, rog, but it's all i got, and...  ...all i got i share with you. go ahead. take all you want.
ohmygod...
wait --
any particular brand?
we get to mexico, we can have a life.
why do you think they call him jangle leg?
xxxxxx
what the hell does that matter?
then how is it we speak the same language?  even in your lies, some truth slips through! that mythical community you're supposed to come from -- fort wayne'?
freak luck for sure.
but she was seeing someone else on the side.
i tried again, waiting here, watching for him. instead it's you. whenever i look for dickie i find you.  what happened to your face?
need any help?
i know it's not.
it appears well.  it has already clotted.
hello.
drink, drink, juanito. you'll never have it so good.
well....what do you want, then?
jason's here in new york.
... is it me? is there something i've done?
i do like him. i can't stop thinking about him.
if it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
i didnít requisition a secretary.
you sound as if you hate it.
coupla things. they got this fed looking around and the girl just split.
you were right.  there's a part of him that knows the truth.  about what he did, about himself.
it's not?
any dope yet on how he got out?
if i don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
you're supposed to call me when you lose your job early. i stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
you need a vacation.
what's wrong with the water next to your bed?
what about it?
this is what family is for, ed! this is when ya come together!
how have you been?
ok.
you're in the central corridor. it connects the personnel areas to engineering.
sure you don't want any salad?
you should feel like shit.
and?
i call 'em wiggers.
all i see are dead people.  everywhere. what's three more?
this information goes back three days. i want the standard file, you know that.
no, that's still in my jacket i was wearing.  we were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock friday.  he's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
no, no, roy, just cash poor. they had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. sell their wife's jewelry. oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. or when i put their minds to it. i stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to cole.
beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
i'm not. but i'm -- i'm not very proud of what i do. i usually get kind of drunk. i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. then i take a hotel room. so i won't have to drive home on the freeway. i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
i think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
out where?
-- no!  i can't go along with this horseshit!  just tell them they can fry me!
you lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
when i was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
i'm really sorry about that, man.
oh-oh -- here it comes. the fatherly talk. you forget i'm already a widow.
the con...!  oh my god.
a practical man, sir. given the marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
you're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend richard low, not suspect zero. i have to tell you, mack, i'm not comfortable where you're going.
car's gone.  we just missed them, that's all.
vodka martini.
i don't think we know for certain.
joel, don't jerk me.  i spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
that's it?
he passed away.
i have a message for him.  about jennifer wilson.
it's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. it's not anymore.
yeah.  are you sure?
wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
big o was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
and you say this is an indian vice? by god!  i don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
you come to peddle me some tapes, lenny?  for old time's sake?  make a couple bucks for the holidays?
what?
grab your socks....
you better believe i can.  i'm sick of people telling me what i have to do.
oh, you're good.
you can make your move when it comes after me.
it might be best to have a man with experience. maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
i don't have any sugar either.
what's this?
look, i've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
--look, when the watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
i can't believe tommy's still pissed at me. he knows i'm moving away, right?
women will want to get to know you...
i went back through the history last night. i read about johann rozenquartz -- i read what he wrote --
i hope you can show more than you did when you let the yakuza butcher linda lee.
john: john:...my daughter...
sounds like tick's already celebrating.
why don't you stay at larry's house? there's plenty of room.
time to impact...?
well that is to be expected. my father...
who the hell is this!?
you're right, a kid is dead, but mook, this isn't the time.
not a chance.
if you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
i have a confession. when we met...
what was he in jail for?
someone with authority i'd imagine, wouldn't you?  don't you know what you're onto? come on.
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus's story. it is a piece of shit.
an extra heel of bread.  please take it, you need your strength.  you've been working so hard.
just what?
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but i hardly think...
look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
ah, jesus...
i don't know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
i am prepared to write anything you tell me.
you never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
it ain't your locker no more.
another satisfied client?
this.  right now.
oh yes! -- upstart!
really?
i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  hey, wait a minute!
can i just ask you one other thing?
yes, paul?
this is an emergency!
you mean behan?  then why are you with him?
ha! too big to make the turn!
listen, what about dinner?
you're out of your depth, trautman. way out.  i'm acting correctly here. not you.  not your gung-ho jungle ace.  it's over.  walk away.
awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "sidney, i got a nasty little problem here." did i say no? i'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... but all of a sudden i can't get you on the phone no more!  why?... and why, as of this date, am i frozen out of the column...
the door's the only way out!
it's her.
are they going to kill you?
i don't know what it is about today, but i feel great!
isabelle?  i need to talk to kim...
there is something evil about her.
i just did. because i have the power.
captain kirk, are you aware that under federation law, the captain of a starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
i'm figurin' how i can say it so's you won't get mad.
one of us pays the other for half.
wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
they look pretty smart, i think.
anyway. sorry. hi.
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then?
probably not.
are you in the book?
can we just rent it from you?
oh, you look so cute as little elvis.
you'll live like this forever. alone.  you were meant to help.  to be with people.  not like this.
maybe they're expecting gruner. i'm gonna be him.
you don't like it, do you?
i know he's due for the last two years. i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
your dad spent all his spare time in here.  he wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
twenty-five minutes. we won't make it in time.
why shouldn't i be in a place like this? i'm a whore!
i don't know anything about that.
all right! now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are d. b., was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house. so he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. what would you say about that? huh?
yeah, yeah— here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
mom?
you're a lucky man.
i did what i came to do.
now look what you did!
we were back in high school. you wanted to join the sky diving team, but i wouldn't let you.
hey, willie, what was claude's plan, anyway?
i'm a lawyer. how's your baby?
why so glum?
you need some weed?
like a sickness and its cure together.
you were talking about the promotion --
mr. scott...
can't i take it for you?
i would forget about the maneuver. i would just get out.
one hour!
i'm okay.
goodbye? where're you going? what about our partnership? i'm making real progress with the microchip.
you want to have dinner?
i like stories.
ruben, my god, i ought to put you on report.
what is this? does everybody know everything i'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
i gave you my card there.
well, i... mmmmm... no, i ain't seen her, sorry.
yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
roger?
a million dollars for our first run is not bad, george.
pretty girl.
well anyway...
besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
i know.  this is a dream, sarah.
palmdale.
i bet you did. i was never bent that way. i'm bent the other way. so, you liked it out there in the world.
no dances, just tell me.
look, chief - i better blow now, because if spats colombo sees me, it's goodbye charlie.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
you're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
four nights. how did you sleep?
peter, let go of the chair!
i didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  i had to teach myself.  and that took time.
jeffrey! come on in.
well, sir, they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base.
what's going on?
so was he scared?
...and it was dartmouth winter weekend, and she was homecoming queen, and i was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders. so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence.
she asked me not to.
shit.
ah.
i wouldn’t mind. thank you.
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him. it gets cold at night.
no... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m.p.'s --
how can you do that?
i don't think so.  the membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
they'll do it.
no.
what are you doing?
oh?... well, quickly please, mothershead, i'm overdue.
and where's he going to be?
thank you, fidel castro.
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it's going to get you into trouble.
do we know it's him using the beacon?  not a decoy?
do you like talk like that?
everyone i know has met her, viktor.
and bourne? where's he now?
what can i do for you, lad?
we're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
i think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  look at me -- not counting the american -- i've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
yah, that's me.
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
why don't you just tell them the truth. those belong to my neighbor phil.
margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in...
but i made this arrangement --
mason.  mason!
oh, you remember now --
i have no illusions about the future. what is, is. we make choices. and we become the sum total of our choices. i can live with that.
sir, he's very upset. his friend was killed and...
i ain't stayin'...i set out lookin' for debbie...i aim to keep on...
how'd it go in there?
i would start with cocktails.
throw it down into the streets! down into the forum.  if it's my father they want then give him to them!
dear, this is mr. rossen, he is the producer...
senator paine, if i could do just that one thing while i'm here, i-- i'd feel that i--
just as you are, sir...
how did you meet him?
"surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
for evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore his forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
every day.  more and more.
how much?
mine.
it's not for you, uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
a twist ending if you will.
this don't feel right. kitchen looks just like i left it. i know, cuz i cleaned it.
yes.  i mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
mid-town mostly.
is this another one of those sun tzu “art of war” tricks?
how you feeling, doc?
come on, junior. everyone's waiting for you, son. the beam of light catches junior's face. he is crouched inside the machine at lane six. jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
i want you to come home with me right now, jody.
oh, no.
him?  you saw that man?
that's bullshit.
how do you write women so well?
what are you looking for? lie, and i'll slit your throat.
-- i was just trying to finish some work!
do you have bandages?
yeah.
we make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
you never had the talk, did you?
what does that have to do with it?
can i ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
only asking.  i did't know you were planning a comeback.
i take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. she's a nutjob.
no he doesn't. he hates fat people.
i mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
not in those words.
you closed it, didn't you, grace?
not mine, stupid. yours.
he says that his father's hurt.
fine -- i'll take my bath.
get him to stand up, night shift.
i hope so.  we gotta go soon.
then why'd you do it?
still clear?
i'll be careful.  i'll see y'later.
what she look like?
this is a very good inn.  shall we stop for dinner?
martin, i'm not connected to those people anymore. not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami.
another delay... with only forty-two minutes left.
i come to you as a last resort -- and i confess that my patience is wearing thin.  must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
i'm getting too old for this shit. one oh four and counting.
when you are ripe for my pleasure, i will enjoy the harvest.
we need ammo... go check his jacket, i'll cover you.
so all that bullshit about god and faith.
this is california, anything is possible.
my father says you have been my friend... you came back for me.
you hoto?
what's fine?
thanks. i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital.
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb. he died three weeks ago.
oh my god.  aw, god.
worst day of my life, man.
i suppose you want a tip?
you should.
oh my god!  she's in there!
excuse me... i should apologize.  i, um... i... have no great love of...
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven.
uh...yeah. i didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
what about your film? isn't it due next week? have you even started it?
they made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
get out.  out!
i'm sorry.  i've got plans.
prairie dog burrow...
perhaps if i were properly motivated.
have you ever had anal intercourse?
he's right. you'd feel much better about it.
oh, i would love to hear it.
i'm staying with a friend.
ben, i'm afraid i've got to ask --
can i offer you something.    a drink? coffee?
haven't we been doing our homework.
and this shit is bad news, mr. masry.  not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your dna, too.  that means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
yes, i wrote it.
i do drink, baron -- i drink to you, baron and to win.  it's good, -- come along, baron.
hey!  do i have a record?  have i ever done time?  i mean i been arrested a few times, who hasn't? parking tickets for chrissake! suspicion of stuff!  have i ever been convicted of anything?
stock broker. as in: never have so few done so little for so much. so what do you see in this?
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself.
...our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
last night? what are you talking about, ray?
what about his engagement to dyan cannon?
night.
you want me to go to constantinople?
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable...
you know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
upham?  good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
i'll take you to a game.
what's the matter?
sergeant, is commander skywalker back yet?
you're with the sports people on the plane, right?
i'll be waiting.
he was here.  you fell asleep.  we took him.  you looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  besides, the young woman, julie, is with him.  believe me, everything is fine.
mania.
you will not hurt him?
tore up from the floor up?
you're like a dog with a bone over this movie, clay.
precisely.
just like i did the hat. have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
it's all right. thanks.
no.  maybe it was aubrey.
i could have stopped him.
you didn't call the sandwich joint with a urgent message?
oh no... this is a battle of nerves between john and me.
this is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- i don't know. i don't know -- can you give me nothing? you have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- i don't want any money, i couldn't live with myself, this thing i've done -- i've fucking done so many bad things -- i fucked around.  i fucked around on him, i fucking cheated on him, alan. you're his lawyer, our laywer, there, i'm his wife, we are married. i broke the conract of marriage, i fucking cheated on him, many times over, i sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... other things i've done..
oh, well, we'll just have to try again. sound like a plan?
pike isn't a name.  it's a fish.
you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i don't know.  jack?
how you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?

velcome to ve vaxverk.
oh, hello mrs. swicker.
what gets into you all? we study the problem. we've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. you've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
nice friend.
oxygen is not the problem.
now what?
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
i doubt that. i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
who's there?  anyone there?
kelly, i want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
you didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
oh, that was fun. let's play something together.
a lot of what happened is jagged. pieces missing. i can't really remember. i just get flashes. usually in my dreams. i'd kind of gotten used to them. at least accepted them....
yeah, they'll find you.  dried up and twice dead.
i wanna do a small buy first.  ten thousand.  we'll see how it goes.
murder.
cindy.
<i>either this was some kind of set up... or the first ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>

guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  hold out til after you're married. that's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  make them pay for him.  make... that's right, the price is their vote. now, we bring him home, the president announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, ta da, here he is.  have him say it like i wrote it, it'll be fine. thanks.  labor, five bucks an hour.  if you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  if you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
what have you done, cut your hand?
chill, man! be cool! this isn't even my apartment!
ben, i'm a man of god.
yes. heating and air conditioning.
what a fuckin' job.
so it's a good plan but it goes wrong; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --
no, on the campus.  i haven't any family.
you have the most architectural skull.  and your nose.  very expressive.
you want me to give up? let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
must you walk so quickly?
yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
what?
your front porch.
you watch him, al, i s...s...stutter!
well... did you sleep with him or not?
i don't know. i can't remember. it was just in my dream.
oh, you fuckers!  you fucking fuckers!  what?  what do you want?
i won't be here next week.  the tumor's inoperable.  i'll be dead.
enough about me.
i hate public transport.
indeed. just a moment - as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him. a very appropriate person to do so. yes.
tie it to both ankles -- leave two feet slack.
yes.
hello, freddie, it's tom, tom ripley.
claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
oh, certainly, sergeant. my name is captain george limburger, and this is captain walter camembert.
and here's one from nice mr. zeiss. he says that...
i'm sorry, bill.
you're so funny...
was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
i think we go on. i'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- i have faith in that.
why?
yes, i thought so.
uh, beg to differ.
you know charlie how-come?
you smell like baby powder.
food-storage room!
hey.
i thought i told you boys to go to bed!
long, thin and filtered.
i'm not. maybe i am.
the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins. marcus -- you remember what the grail tablet said. "across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon."  but where exactly?
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
i don't like to do what people expect. then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
one way.
0 my god.
hey, where's finch?
cool pictures.  you a fan?
you like taking risks.
he's still got a good grip.  we need to dig more.
time's up... we'll have to take them out immediately.
to tear down the walls of jericho.
will you get time off to do that?
just for your information, ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
oh, ok.   maybe.
sandra sinclair.  wanna know her real name?  bella iskowitz.  no one's who they really are, jer. everyone's someone else.  even you. even me.  especially me.  i'm peter appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
nah.  maybe.
have you ever known anybody a long time?
yeah.
sir! they voted me most likely to succeed!
he's vicious, doctor. besides, it's against the rules.
you could double the size of your hardware store!  you'll be rich.
"raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
he?
he never said "go".
it's not that simple, sister rebecca -- the lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
yeah.  what?
i guess you'd have to guess. not having been there with them. having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
just a second -- he has to go.
well, you know... what do i know about clothes... i've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
where is the soho grand?
and then we run out of food and oxygen.
hi, baby. what are you doing awake? where's mommy?
public scorn carries a terrible sting. trust me. i'm a woman who knows.
was dignan screaming like, get me a bag!
well, ain't no use hanging around here.
jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
well, darling, if it gets any better than that, i'm going to have to bring you up here to new york.
um-hmm. well, that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life. you walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, rose.
you must be related to the lavals of marseilles.
he doesn't scare me. i'll kick his ass in.
you do?
you're just afraid i'll drop dead before i finish the damn house.
so there you are. it seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
looks like epps' gonna get some tonight.
look, charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
do you want something to drink? a beer? a glass of water?
you're back.  what happened?  never mind.  what's going on?
sure do.
he's right, zack. it doesn't matter.
fuck you and stay off the phone.
who is it from?
alan!
i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: gregor had expensive tastes.
you fucking liar!
i see you found what you was lookin' for.
i don't remember. but off the top of my head, i'd say black.
my kids don't have enough to eat!
is he sick?
no thanks.
it is!  this was my grandfather's private library.  look at this!
it's okay. it's okay.
are you going public with this?
he really was!
so much.
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
what did you say?
professor, we need to talk.
gladly, caesar.  and, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
clemenza.  you take care of paulie. i don't ever want to see him again. understood?
after work?
uh-huh.
turn that jungle music off.  we ain't in africa.
aaah, what's the use?
-- and take this with you.
i'm doing it!  i'm doing it!
that, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
i don't know...
because he hides.
i like you, too, nathan.
macready!
no.  tell me what you want to say.
how lucky we are.
where is he?
i didn't say that, i said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
but you <u>have</u> been in venice?
it's not easy.  none of it is.  i have to find some way to get on with my life and i'm going to try.  i finally figured that out.  i'm going to do my best....
why don't we send her to a movie -- like ben-hur?
if you said yes i would have had a reason.  you should let me redress those bandages.  before you go.
get your breathing down. you sound like a cement mixer.
who was your girl before annette?
ya like that, chief, huh?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can. usually here at your bedside.
where we going?
it must be tough, having to be clark kent.
a quarter of a million, jimmy.
are you kidding?  you buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
where you been?
where?
we've eaten.
hey, that's whacked!  i thought we was gettin' on here!
what are you doing on the reservation?
probably not. no. why?
look, kiddo, don't worry about it. i really don't care that much. i'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
i wouldn't worry about it. you've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
yes. friedman’s the fuckin’ austrian!
the judge is here. over here, judge munson.
yes, i am.  but i prefer the machete.  certain moves, however, call for a sword.
actually, kayleigh, the reason i came back to town was to talk to you.
what do i have to do?
i'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. i'm talking about working for a living. sharking.
he said he filed...
then what?
it sucks.
that is correct.  i was engaged to render an opinion.
i know. i feel the same thing. but we're between a rock and a hard place. we can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
i hope you liked it.
see, you don't know him... that's why you're the one... you can get it...
that was a red light!! i told you you have to stop at a red light!!
what shit, honey?
yeah...
no - no lights.  we don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
why would i lie?
i don't want to hear that music right now.
do you feed on mice and rats?
yes, mr. dowd.
my god...
i'll give you an eight. 
i don't get you.  you act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
what happened to you?
hey....i was just telling everyone about how i was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
it was an accidental. i don't want to go into the details. it was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. i mean, obviously, since swifty's dead. that's why anthony never graduated.
i gotta figure some way out of this thing!
why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
yeah?
you know as much as i do, miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime, weren't you?
...i don't know.
i absolve you in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit, amen.
yes, i want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
jabez -- you ought to talk to tom about joining the grange.
yes.
you know he's fucking us.
i do know to a certainty. and you know what's going to happen now. you should admit your situation. there would be more dignity in it.
wrap it up.
why "of course"?
well, of course i like her. she's a peach.
the thing is, i'm responsible for the way he's acting. it's the nightmare juice. it's got to be.
charlie. how are you.
but putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
how could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
god, vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
there's only one thing it could be... short range scan.
it's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
what are you doing?
gonna pluck us off the tit.
gentlemen!  is this right for a fight?  it's been so long.
no, no –
she likes a stolie, no ice.
you're right.
you lied to me
you were holding it upside down weren't you?
still champions.
before you are.
do you know the marquis de la tours?
the good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
hello.
eleven.
judgement day ...
three days, man.
ah!  you're ambulatory!
no problem, consider it done.  i had this idea of shooting on location. outdoors, you know? maybe at some famous xenia landmarks. you think that would be a problem?
you got money in this tub?
how's it goin'?
you were right. he found me.
start?  this isn't a good time.
...son.
i'll just take a minute. deborah ann kaye. you know what i'm talking about. the case is going to trial. our chief witness is a dr. david gruber, you know who he is?
i'm francis boutillier.  this is my son, philip.
are you a relative?
you know this earth - this person.
he's all right. he'd like to see you. but listen...  what's the law doing to me?  do they think i did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
she was your sister.
did you make any change in this room?
they?
no... that wasn't right. i want you to be my wife.
your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. he and his wife gone back to chicago?
this is all normal. don't worry. the abortion procedure... it affects you. it's the ether, too. it'll take a little time.
well, if i go back on my word, i'll kill her.
yes - if i can't convince sophie, i'll never be able to see tatiana....
the boys had 'em. i know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
don't worry.  i don't wear it at the dinner table.
hey, nick...
never to pretend to know more than i did.
i'm not accusing.  i'm asking.  do you...do you find me too...too giving?  too-too-too competent?  too-too, i don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
oh, babe...
because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
i'd love it!
did they disconnect testa's computer?
i’m an american and in america, people sue. so to prevent a lawsuit, i baked a tart. and i don’t bake.
scott, i want you to meet daddy's nemesis, austin powers.
don't let your father's business infect your life.
it's there!
daddy, don't start with this again.
it's all about sisterhood. everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
and what qualities are those? intelligence or stupidity?
but they don't know about the translation!  they could be in danger right now.
disruptors are off-line, sir.
if i get laid, you won't tell annie?
how'd you do it?
continue the joke.
what are you doing?
is he making any progress, doctor?
drugs judge, they're gonna flood west oakland with dope. jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. and while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every panther they can find.
gimme a break, will you?  shut up.
...well, it suits you...
you owe me an explanation.  you can't treat me like this.
tell me about it.  l.a. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been.  i mean, i use condoms.  always.  and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  not only am i better in the sack than an amateur, i'm probably safer.
bought it on the way over.  clean as a nun.
if my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
you didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? the stuff i left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
you sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars i worked my ass off to earn?
hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- nice dog -- well, i'll see ya later.
you know it, lilly.
we're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  and we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the u.s. of a.
she never gives him a turn.
please.  it won't happen again.
you still questioning any cubans?
we have a library?
you don't look thirty-five.
might be different in new york.
oh for god's sake, louella-
michael.
are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? i have other things you might like.
are you nuts, walking into a gun?
you don't really believe this do you?
later. let's go...
what?
i guess, yeah.
it's a sat-tracker.
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
ah! so you admit there is someone!
hey, great they're back.
got it.
have a mac.
faith, this is my mother.
so you don't want to hear my new ending?
trinity?  the trinity?  the trinity that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city d-base?
i wouldn't worry too much about it, stew. she'll see it your way.
you think sandmen will?  there's no other way for me,
you came for us....
is that your final answer?
uh--jefferson smith's residence?
now.
we're leaving from my house in three hours. if you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
i got to get a lot curiouser than i am--with all them cops out there.
what's your problem?
mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
look. we can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. good night!  no telling what that screwball might do. i walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
take this mask. it may look like the empress, but it's not.
we get ordell to come to my office. nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
where do you think we came from?
oh, you-you have that one?
besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there?
you were a lady in distress, weren't you?
where is the money?
how nice for everybody.  come swimming. the water's glorious.  you'll fix it.  you'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
the maze has been changed --
is it over if they arrest you now?
i've seen your television commercials. "if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... it should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
you wouldn't be here otherwise.
no!...please...please don't make me stay...i swear...if you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  i'll go right out the window.
i'm not leaving without her.
the badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
hmm.  it seems you left something in our safe.
i don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  you'd prob'ly fit right in.
um-hmm. almost too perfect.
heil you know who!
surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
there's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, lex. you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero?
yeah. what are you doing now?
huh? no, not my wedding. yours.
close to retirement?
zuzu, wake up...
what?
what is this, rogoff?
shotguns? what, like guns that fire shot?
so what do we do -- nothing?
you remember junie?
this shall be your cell, mary clarence.
oh god, this is so weird.
i don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
frankly, ted, i'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of new york.
yes, well, i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  i'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
say matt, i'll have to have some money for those manville payrolls.
congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition, doctor.
i'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.
when did you see him -- what time, i mean?
i can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
stay away!
sure.
i spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
why? why have you done this to my friend?
we've certainly missed you.
who are you?
two heads.
we blacked our hands and faces.  at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  the name of the village was mhravitch. remember that name!
what about han?
detective, does it look like a murder?
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
vermicelli.
my god, i mean, you know how i am about insects.
jennifer?
here they are.
great.
no.
good morning.
first -- have you found me a crew?
right.
you're a little touchy about it.
this is it.
it's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
because of my father, i guess.
you suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
what do these guys think, i made cougar quit?
stop now.
a whole lot of nothing.
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill.
will you not come in?
that'll bring me down, too. eventually.  you gotta know that.
goddamn it. i gotta have some kinda life!
thanks for the invite.
well, that's not the way it works, really. and you ate most of your food already, too...
because they're still here.
but you told me to look in the paper!  you told me i'd be perfect!
but here you are inside, aren't you?
baseball?
where's he living these days?
you got me, jim--but they do.  want some water?
"need" is a good, solid word.
you've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. that's not our betty...
your move.  okay, vaughn, you drive.
*                     we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  the second amendment types'll love that.
"go get 'em, honey."
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
is there no way they can get back to you?
you don't buy it.  okay.  so i still want betty mayfield.  where is she?
the medical bill are 61 thousand now. i've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
no, i want an answer, is the story done?
they're lying dead in the mud out there and i'm trying to find out how come.
bullshit!
secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  there's a place two blocks east of here. enzo's.  say 10:30.
let me ask you a question: do you think this guy's out of shape?
i don't know.
is this your establishment?
i want to see swann face to face.
floppy, huh?
--hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
why?
yeah, i know. just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
well you must go. it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. of course, i'm rather partial.
margo in the cub room. i couldn't be more surprised if she'd said grant's tomb.
right.  they seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  they're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
damn.
this river's fed by a glacier.  willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
a toon?  noooo.
hello, reggie -- i am waiting for jean-louis.
okay, now i'm supposed to say, 'hmmm, that's interesting but...' then you say --
bad news, you crazy? you have no world view, wladek, that's your trouble. the news couldn't be better. the moment hitler invaded russia, i knew we'd be all right. remember napoleon. same business. the germans will freeze to death, please god.
no.
wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, i need to lay down. there's a cot back there.
is she... dead?
but it seems to be enough to condemn him.
fuck off, dave.
would you go to war to do that? 
i'm sorry, bill --
i just wondered if you had gone over my speech, ben.
mr. shaw, can you identify this man?
lucy.
pleasure to meet you, i'd like to see my brother, thank you.
seventeen percent, huh? sounds big.
to show that we're negotiating.
i mean it -- you got enough money now. head out for california. surf's up, jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? she has it -- you know that.
can't this thing go any faster?
i've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  you tell diego i don't appreciate it.  you tell him i want my money by friday.  can you do that?
well, in any case, rocky, i'll send you my book.  "six crises."
i presume the planes are armed?
it's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
why should i tell you?
of course not --
i said it was bad judgment!  what else do you want me to say?
oh, but doctor. the music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- that's life --
is the hospital covered?
you got a girl?
shhh! liar.
good heavens, bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
can't that female take no for an answer?
...you all right?
what?!
hi.
what a good idea.
i'm talking to you right now. who's linda?
you told it to me.
no, why?
so how many rooms am i checked into in this dump?
paul, i know you've been out.
...fine.
the others already told me, o'neil. they wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  because you went soft on another women --
we got him!  dad you got him!
very traditional.
more nerve than the doctor, i must admit.  he hasn't been home for two days.  has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
now see here young man.
only family allowed, nancy. you know the drill.
men sill give women flowers, don't they? i mean, as a sign of appreciation? i'm not that out of date, am i?
that's a tragedy. can i finish my story please? i began my search for meaning. i was a catholic, jew, scientologist, sufi, buddhist. i went to a psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. and they all pretty much say the same stuff.
okay, okay, okay--
little miss, you can't stay here. you've got to come with me.
here. now leave me alone.
i don't know anything!
we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
go away.
know what i think?
something serious has happened.

i thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
we're not going to make the storage room!
but first, you have to start with the clothes!
are you sure?
could be suicidal. it's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
not funny, sam!

jesse, you explain to lyla. my girl, you know, from that time...
liz -- can i call you liz? it's a beautiful name --
some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. i don't blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. you want your women on pedestals. but they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.

but, this could be serious.
three years, jesus, he's crazy as barnes...
larry mitchell found out.  so you killed him.
i don't understand this luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  how could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
we've been talking to -- well, let's just call him sleepless in seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  the number to call is...

bobby!
that'd be seventy in new york. you stole it!
hell.  this is just like fucking star wars, man!
let me tell him.  let him decide.
you're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
i'll be blunt. i know you can take it.
but i saw it another. i saw it as untouched. i mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers i could shake down. who the fuck were they gonna run to?  so, i started getting everybody in line. best of all, for the first time in my life, i figured out a way not to lose.
julius!
i kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  more than a great break, maybe just what i needed...just when i needed it...angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?

yeah even then look what happened: michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me.
what happened to you?
thank you.
it's as smooth and slick as oil.
they have no right to treat you like that.  you've given them every- thing.  for four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
...don't you drink?
nobody gets invited to clark brandon's parties. they just go.

they couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....

it was just like before, wasn't it? wasn't it?  but you are making progress. instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
you cannot run from your destiny, conner.
mm. better.

i just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
a month? so, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?

there's nothing... no reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... seems like a totally isolated incident.
it's the leather bindings, i love the fragrance of vintage books.
then it's fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me. in the meantime, captain chekov, i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates.
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps. how fast are you going?
next time it'll be my neck.
thanks.
can we trust him?
so it did.
i knowed you was crazy when i saw you settin' there. i knowed exactly what was in store for me.
you got something better?
i don't know sometimes.
and you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>la vita nuova</u>?-- 
no...
oh, no.
picked them up from the printers yesterday
you are lately come to scotland, joseph?
the official inquiry blamed weir's design for the ship's loss.
i don't.  so, no.
you're the advisor.  you should stop her.  she's not qualified.  she's just a sophomore.
listen, hannah, i'm flattered, really, but right now i --
well, he killed my partner!
there'll be other chances.
show that to the station manager.  tell him leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
yes?
you've been back to dallas?
you threaten me with my uncle? after what i'm doing for you?
it's very simple.  you worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  i've just never seen it done that way before, detective.
ah-hah, i see. a cozy dinner. but aren't threesomes a little awkward? how does the phrase go--
mrs. langtry, i'm sorry.
you don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- good morning, miss kubelik -- good night, mr. sheldrake -- i'm still crazy about you, fran.
what?
to the bed.
eh? nothing? rachel, you bring this man to our house. with his gun of the hand. you bring fear to this house. fear of english with guns coming after. you bring blood and whispers of more blood. now english music... and you are dancing to english music! and you call this nothing?
aramis, this will never --
max, if we lived in california, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
bring -- me -- the -- violin!
i told you, i'm not a comedian.  and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: stupid jokes and canned laughter.
mary had been there, one night, and had left.
got tired of me?
that's right.
here, let me carry that.
yes i know all that.  mac, i need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
time's up, admiral...
we're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit, now do your part
no.  no!  morpheus!  don't!
i swear to god.
i'm will stanton, and um...i've had a little accident, as you can see.
what do you think?
you should talk to elaine.  that was her best friend.
anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. that's less than what it's appraised at.
ray.  the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  what we have here, is you on the van ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
where are you from most recently?
peter warne? i don't like it.
is this stephanie's kid? sure is cute.
you're leaving?
why not tell us what you have heard? hmm?  how much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
you know, rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. it will amuse your customers.
then you should carry a gun.
no!
i just want the key to my jewelry, and i want you to let me go.
you're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, kringelein.
my mom drinks, too... why do people drink, creasy?
the door was open.
promise.
no.  many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. this is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, m. charnier.
playing hooky again?
hindenburg...
that was such a great evening.
what was it we had for dinner tonight?
agreed.
wait -- down where?
oh!
are you with the fbi, mr. balint?... or any other law enforcement agency?
gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
i thought you were with amy.
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow.
b & w may have threatened litigation... cbs is on the block...  but you, i mean, i know how...
yep.  maggie -- someone to see you.
let her go, cin.
you'll do it?
yes.
please do not refer to mr. conyers as "keith," okay? my barf reflex is already heightened these days.
i think you overestimate our dear viennese, my friend. do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
uh-huh.
what?
how can i know such a thing?
i can describe it.
dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  even i don't understand it sometimes.  now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
then why isn't there anyone around?
mr. newcombe, i have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
i don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
i'm afraid it's not very frightening.  they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as i understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
that is our most modestly priced receptacle.
yeah, we talked about sex, too. oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
don't worry about it. we'll find out when it goes bad.
how soon can we get something?
uh -- to kill the doctors?
you look awful.
and--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
you got it.
and don't get too logical, driscoll. in police business it doesn't work. i wish it did.  but it doesn't
i hear you got money to spend.  i hear you're interested in... interesting things.
i got tired of hating my father.
so everyone is serenely happy in shangri-la? nobody would ever think of leaving?  it's all just so much rot! she's pleaded with me ever since i came here to take her away from this awful place. she's cried in my arms for hours, for fear i'd leave her behind. and what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
what if?
yeah, this is sergeant tanaka from holenbeck, i need a current address for a jeffrey....
i hope so. they haven't posted anything.
did he ever fail to provide for you?
you haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  you act as if you had neurosis --
okay man i ain't going to push. but remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. come on, we'll give you a lift.
i terrible with mechanical things.
of course, the slaughtered lamb. why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
no?
polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges. i couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
it's been 84 years...
i've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
you look great.
what was <u>that</u>?
seventeen.
and the united nations? surely?
yah!
very funny.
think i overplayed it?
baxter.
i'm perfectly calm, i'm a normal human being.  i'm going for a walk in the park.
how come her own mom isn't helping her?
hey, skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
phil.  what are you doing?
let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  were you followed?
no. you'll have to get somebody else.
don't be nervous.  they said you'd be nervous.
how'd you do?
why would you do that?
okay.  it's not a problem... let's just sit ... i'11 talk to the gallery ...
it's a roach, guy --
i know my rights.
your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
this is such a mess.  i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now i'm landed in it all over again.  for god's sake, i've got a boyfriend.
you wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? take a shot!
so, where to?
i didn't really do anything -- honest -- i mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
they're in the neighborhood. they usually hassle vietnamese grocers.
y-yes.
the difference is you exploit a weakness.
murder.
john millaney.
just what?
you degenerate pig!
that's not funny.
who?
...you know?  i, uh...
you have your extracurricular secrets, i have mine.  we'll hold a clarification session soon.  for now, i need your fearsome old habits at the victory motel. we're going to brace a man who may know who killed jack vincennes. can i count on you?
about this telegram to moscow. why should you bother? i'll write it for you.
have we ever met?
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
no.  you are the traitor.  you are murderer.  i am director.  action!
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
um, clear?  i'm sorry...about before. i...
well, you're not.  oil and vinegar?
and the year before that?
so what's the problem?
katrina.  why do you follow?
jesus christ, miles. get out!
and no birds sing.
what i need this for?
idiot...
isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...we're just so different.
there is no masbath here.  my father's loan papers are missing.
afraid of lions.
what do you want from me?
left field somewhere.  well, bill, i want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
you don't have an appointment, do you?
not anymore! now you can do both at the same time! according to myth, the earth was created in six days. watch out: here comes genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
must've been a terrible row.
this is how you see the sky?
they killed our friend. it's personal now. besides, if we do that, then julien died for nothing. the tapes are the key.
i'm sorry. i'm not sure i understand. you wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
two...
something else. do most attacks go unreported?
what do you want, <u>officer</u>?
my mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
i don't even want to talk, but i gotta tell you that when i first saw you last week, i, i couldn't stop thinking about you. you've been stuck in my head.
it's better...  you see, it's my turf, so i don't want contracts i'm not informed about, on my turf.  i'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
and--?
restraining order?  where the hell you meet this girl?
thanks, sister. how are ya.
sure, i know chuck. i know him.
it looks like a tablecloth.
what did you hear?
what is it doing?
we ran out without my shoes and the floor.  i gotta get my stuff.  what about our savings?
john, there's someone here who would like to meet you. would that be alright?
are you sure she don't know about the money?
either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. here all eyes gaze on us.
if freddy's loose, i mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  another age?  another form?
what?
no, i don't think so. no, i don't think they're gonna hate you at all. on the contrary, i think-
he'll give us the documents.  but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran.  then he'll go without a whimper.
mm hm. but only a few folks know how to get there. wally. rollo linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. me.
exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that's where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just isn't right with him. y'know?
aa-a-a-a-ah! 
i bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, nathan lee.
shit, we just started.  but i better log out of this.
negative, no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard.
this man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
not it...?
she thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
you're something else, dil, you know that?
i said, the old man's screwy!
i know.  poor morpheus.  without him we are lost.  we will never find the one.
no -- no -- not yet. well, i mustn't let it interfere with my duty. any news here?
where are we going?
doesn't mean you had to marry her.
but you asked the wrong questions. do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? how quickly they perish of their own will.
oh dear.  i <u>have</u> made you nervous.
rick...i can't.
what was he doing in the rec room?
vaughn, get the m-seventy-nine ready.
wow!  that's neat.   can i sit in it?
it seems like we're getting lower.
okay.
i am--it's our only chance.
where will you go?
well, you're two up on me now. 
why are brothering with that?
this isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
you just cooking then?
no further questions.  thank you mrs. phillips.
three whips. to go.
you saved my life, monkeybone. i never would've made it without you.
how do you know all these things she doesn't know?
i should kill you right here! i never thought you'd do this to me but i guess there's a lot i didn't know about you!
i know how it is.
i'll put the, in your r...
do you like this hotel?
son, was rose in your room last night?
what the hell is wrong with you?
i understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint.
daddy!
...and therafore there is no consequence?
who the hell are you?
shows how much you know. it's something about tomorrow.
carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. they finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. only charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. he beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. it's taken gideon, tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
sam, if it's december 1941 in casablanca, what time is it in new york?
doing well.  this is?
this is her roommate.  daphne can't talk right now.  is it anything urgent?
courage is an emotion too, data.  now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
i can't even hear myself think.
nice work, norman.
i don't.
yeah.
i haven't had fun like that since college.
and what is that worth, the promise of a woman? you're very funny, highness.
hi.
i understand.  there'd be no point.
well, i'm very tempted.  it's such a beautiful yacht.  what's it called?
ok.
a locksmith too? why d'you ever bother with writing?
no, i mean i can check it for you.
yeah ...
i take it she likes the guy.
yes. i'd considered it.
well, you weren't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut.
are we going to make it?
did we go sailing?
oh, i'm very sorry father. hi.
that's what she would say herself.
i dressed the wound. then i've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
the red sox are your problem. i never understood about you and the red sox. everybody rooted for the yankees.
i didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  look, i lied to you. i'm not a reporter. when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i'd make it. but i haven't. that's why i needed this story so bad. i just couldn't tell you i'm a failure.
where?
well, not monumentally.
australia.
so you're thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner. ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
i won't be able to stand.
no.  you can be a thief and have a conscience:  not me.  why did you have to tell me about this!  what do i have to do to get away from this guy?  when you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now i'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does.  and it looks like he's done it again.  you know his definition of a  true paranoid?
kind of exclusive, ain't you? we got calls to make, you know.
i should have done that.  fixed it and more.  get out from under what i been under...
it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy.
oh?
hey. you know-- we're not the same. i got a good life, this job suits me. i come and go when i please --
let's go.  we're takin' her home!  move it!  get the cars!
keystone what?
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs?
did you see that sucker burn?!
...were you in the service, ed?
i guess you have to go on faith.
be quiet!  listen!
whatsamatter with you? are you crazy?
i don't know -- few hours, i guess.
urr... uggg... errr...
oh, an tv a minute and already an attitude.
she's in trouble?
you talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  i guess i'll have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe.
what are you doing?
very nice.  sisters, have we learned our lesson?  i won't hold this little episode against anyone.  i'll try not to.
she's right. they'll string her up.
this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  wait.  use the frosted glasses.
won't do any good.
if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the british must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
my name's tyler.  frank tyler. pleased to meet you, ma'am.
i suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
what?
he left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  that's the last time anybody saw him.
i bet you're ticklish.
... and then everything blew up. and then i woke up.
goodbye mom.  i'll be okay.
sir, the gentleman does not understand english.  he would not in any case, take the stand.  he came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  he is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
will we get another ship?
she's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
kid, get outta the way!!
ain't heard from ralph since last christmas. don't matter -- i've got a new crop.  i'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. i'm good for something in this old world and i know it, too! we know that she will rout the devil.
seriously, when i left, i joined the army and took the service exam. they found my psych results fit a certain profile. a certain "moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... i was loaned out to a cia- sponsored program. it's called "mechanical operations." we sort of found each other...
gate three. it's boarding now.
lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
sorry about that.  that's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
good evening, mr. halloran.  what can i do for you?
i've been trying to reach you. you're tougher to get than the president.
maybe you'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, nigel?
a brute.
i don't need your charity. i don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
amazing, mr. chang. this place is amazing! and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. oh, i've looked around. i've seen everything. your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
no...
i got an audition, i won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, i'll see you later. love you.
you've sacrificed?! if you'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents --
thank you janey.
then what are we going to do?
then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
rehab. outpatient. i have to go once a week. it's kind of like aa.
i guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
-- then perhaps, the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld.
we can't take a second more.
you mean our past as in me and sid. this has nothing to do with you gale.
a little.  you get out of the car. that's right, fuctard. i'm talkin' to you!
he will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  he'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
tom? you can come on. they gone.
carter...here comes the rich white man.
oh, it's fine. fine.
i told you so.
i've seen guys like you go under before. guys that never had a worry. then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. the first thing that happens to a guy—
i have to.
is that all? i thought it was about three hundred.
yes, yes. they were very sincere about it too. you see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. they've never known anything different. so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
you were great.
the movie star?
yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. after the rains.  look good as new.
listen buddy! cut the crap! we're looking for ann, not making a goddamn movie!
i think he's got a point.
all right. kisses to you.
yeah.
nothing.  why do you think i should?
why?
cute.
yes?
damn, it really hurts, mom.
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
but i do have a theory...
no!
just a sec... i need to talk to someone.
you just shoot at something?
get off of me you cripple!
where we headed?
that's highly inappropriate.
did you speak to the governor?
my shoe?
fine. we hit this bank.
wait.
so what else has superman got?
mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code...
then why don't i see any pictures of me up there?
i guess so.
your father?
you know, i never got your name.
what are you looking at?
no. the pill will change all that. then he wouldn't have blamed me. we were just too young.
is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded... something remorseless...
alright, okay.  look...
that's ancient history.  that has nothing to do with you and i.
you do?
take the whole lot. i won't need it.
missed 'em dan.  you're aiming high!
oh shit.  harry... what're you doing?
oh yes. hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. my goodness, what happened to your nose?
you keep a bat under your seat?
isn't it beautiful!
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  i decide when i'm done with your boyfriend.  not him, and certainly not you.  unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
it's your fault! you brought daniel webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! you played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! you can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- i don't want to -- to talk to you again!
you didn't... get it on with him?
it won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  there! made me drop a stitch!  sit down, you make me nervous!  lan's, that's the way a man always is. thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
what can i do for you?
it's an amazing place, don't you think?
can i look at the pictures?
i would appreciate that.
go after her.
make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
i hear him.  he rides to the hollow and back.
it's my dad. he worries.  hi, dad. i miss you too.
somebody does. it's more honest this way. you do your own dirty work.
darling!
he'd kill me.  he'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
i have paid the penalty. now let's have some music.
you're my princess, aren't you?
harold chasen.
i just can't absorb it all. this place, the equipment. what it must have cost.  why all the secrecy? why do you wear the mask?
no ! don't open any of them ! they're all wrong. just wait.
don't be a sore loser.  go ahead. take your pick.  i'll wait.  go ahead.
what are you giving me with the omelette?
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that's your enemy, not your audience. your audience hasn't even been born yet. it's a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
we're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. let's not make it worse. if anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
i will, frank, i will. something came up, okay?
you're cheating on george? jennifer, how could you?
it's that woman from the coach!
jesus christ, pops, don't start with this shit.
it's okay.  i'm still here, chief.
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
i figured.
disgraceful.
well now, miss flaemm, we can talk.
what i mean, when i say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. it is vulnerable and endearing. and that is annoying as shit.
i told you already: jennifer jenzen, executive v.p. of --
it's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, burt --
i hope you know what you mean to me. not just because of what you're doing. because of who you are.
that the french and cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
but you haven't put in for emigration.
sir te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu.
where's the rest of it?
i can't. i can't. you think you know so much.
stay still.
you think the chemists that invented agent orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'boy, i really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  you think oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
does she know that's why you're using her?
what is this?!
try it again.
would you tell me why?
you figger scar means to kill us?
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some action there.
no.  now.  you fucked him.
good, 'cause i liked what i saw.
yeah, okay.
you're saying that brown & williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
may i remind you that duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
we wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
increase his heart rate.
rest, william.
oh, i don't need another guess. it's quite obvious.
tell me your news, zoe.
why rose? why rose, daddy?
andy, it'll be fine!  it's what we're known for!  "maui?  "wowie!"
-- you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  if the discrepancy really was something big, eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  no poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
i wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
it's possible. please don't ask me any more questions now. just wait, wait for me. i'll be back. i need you here.
all the suites are about the same.
i had to -- for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
don't let them hurt you.
okay, seeya.  vada?
all right, now nobody panic, i've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
well, i'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, california time, to mr. william sampson in beverly hills...
where's the power and radio setup?
that's because he misses you.
dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
who brought up this bright idea?
what the hell?  it shut us down.
she finds him.
oh, just that he loves her. that she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. how he adores siena. how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
sure... sure, it's his house.
he's a little unhappy.  i hope he wasn't a nuisance?
yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
tell me something, buddy.  you know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but i don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  do you?
of course you will look mean, tom, you will look really scary.
harbor air, do you read?  over?
hey, what's this? wearing papa's things? now that's cute. that's what i call real lovey-dovey. yessir.
what do you mean?
shut your ass up and grab the wall!
would it be painful for you?
you mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? what'd you say?
jabez! couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
no!  no, that's ok.  i like to.  i love boiling water.  it's a specialty of mine.  why don't you go watch cartoons?
dorothy. no!
now i'm the one who's nauseous. so what's the deal? what do you need me for?
paula, i never try to fool anybody about who i am, what i want... so if even in the back of your --
i have to see my father and his people when we get back to the mall.
like in nothing.  nobody.  nix.
bet you do. everybody miss her. that was a good woman...well, i don't know whether the bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
i need your help, master.  i'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  he's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
which was?
yeah, two things pete, that --
what?
so she's married?
plus you have nothing else to do all day.
much obliged. what do i do for fun? do you want to know what i do for fun or what i did for fun?
oh god, it's that bloody yank!
and the senate supports you?
shocking. did you know the government is wasteful?  you heard it here first. oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
quite so.  narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve rome...
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this, harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. they're trying to save the planet. there's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
what's the matter?
didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on norris if you were one of them.
house or apartment?
you look at me as though i had said something foolish...
no.  we're going to bring him down.
what did i do wrong?
you were the one who got me in.
chelsea 2-7099.  we scared him once. maybe we can scare him again.  i'm using that word "we" a little too freely, i guess. i don't take any of the chances.
royalty?
and take it easy with this shit, will you? i mean, this can only make matters worse.
i'm saying it because it's true. inside of us we both know you belong with victor. you're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. if that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
you got a hall of fame arm but you're pissing it away.
we do the operation after i finish. i can't risk not finishing... i thought you understood what i was doing.
surely my pleasure, miss davies..
the energizer's bypassed like a christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
i'm not at the top of the empire state building.  i'm here.
i should have known.
all right - if you insist.
that...? vestibule.
sometime?
are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
holy smokes! you'll never get out yourself! better phone for some help.
so there were no problems?
tis not the time to speak of cheer.
gossip counts.  lord aberdeen was right.  this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
what brown hands you have.
no really, i can stay a while.
i said you can be too crude sometimes? i don't think i care for it.
i'm starting to wonder the same thing... how much do you know about what happened to you?
then who operated the store?
yes, you are. i can tell. what's the matter?
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
i'll see him alone.  everyone knows you're my muscle.  we'll make it social.  tell kross i'll meet him for dinner.  tonight if you can arrange it.
...for my kid rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. we're going into a new age pal. so how's business today.
my powers fade, arthur. i resort to cheap tricks...  yes! i enjoy every moment of my foolishness, i join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. but you! you betray yourself.
i'll be there in three hours.
have you thought of what you want planted yet?
something on your mind, lisa?
black capsule.
yes. enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
i do different things on different days.
how come you never ask me any important questions? don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? or a cure for cancer? what about your family? what about people?
i'm calling the police. right now.
what the hell are you asking me for? tag it. move it.
is that the way it is?
okay.
don't worry about it.
what do you want?
what whispers?
helping people makes me happy.
you're on this...
why not?
a man has to choose what he will be. i believe that.
look, i've got a lot of problems and i'm trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me.
the guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
lois, what are you doing?
yes.
hers.
"is the day so young?"
i swear, sidney, i can't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you...
boyfriend?
good.
i’ve got kids, i’m going home...
both, sir.
all i can say is, that's one helluva attitude, mr. mcfly. 'let's explode a hundred megaton geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
operator.
i've told you.
i will not be scrogged.  i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
sure.
no one's trying to buy you, willie. it's important to know why you're telling us this.
you okay, honey?
sophy?  are you okay?
suppose, now, roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
what have you seen before?  this is nothing.  seaweed.  mud.  some- thing in the lens.
you know, how's everything?  you doing okay?  how's frederick?  i mean, elliot.
i was quoting from the bible. if the shoe fits, wear it.
oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. oh no, i won't wear garters—
...why?
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
i didn't plan it this way, fran -- actually, it's all baxter's fault.
adrian -- you?  you killed blake, and --
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off --
why can't i get rid of you?  why can't i just wish you away?
look who's talking.  pretentious bullshit.  who's the guy with william blake and the tigers, eh?
where's your partner, the jumpy one? why isn't he here?
we're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
yes.  but
destiny?  you living in a perfume commercial?  she's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
then what are we doing sitting around yapping? let's eat!
because i know rock-n-roll.
where the hell you goin'?
what?
listen, ahh - -
maybe i'll see you again sometime, huh?
what an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  so that's it.  now there's nothing between you and ignition.
she is.  don't go in there.
she's cute as a button.
do you want to rest a bit?
no, not exactly a man of the people.  "also known as vigo the cruel, vigo the torturer, vigo the despised, and vigo the unholy."
on the street.
well, it's good that you're there.
then you know where jacqueline is?
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
[south america.]
the question is, who are you? you are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. elijah muhammad can bring you into the light.
if we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
i was born just two blocks from this studio.  right on lemon grove avenue.  father was head elec- trician here till he died.  mother still works in wardrobe.
no, i mean you, right now. not it you were somebody else.
you gonna climb that with one arm?
...i stank, didn't i?
are you now. i know about porkers in the water --  here. tie me a sheepshank.
what will you do?
my, my... ah, who are you?
well?
could you do somethin' for me?
no, no, she went up by herself. this was not my responsibility.
you--a friend to me?
why did you let this man in, m'sieu filiba?
you just relax. nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to shout...
chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  but you can bring someone if you like.
i like you so much. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't believe it.
what time are visiting hours?
you mean it's heisted.
you were late.
rick, i'm sick and tired of having you --
it's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but i moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
yes.  dr. h. delbruck.
sylvan? no; i snowballed him.
the poor thing. six years?
you are cruel!  your heartless jesting worse than torture!  how can you speak of love when you see what i am!
the t-1000 has the same files that i do.  it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson's house.
yes.
security.
nothing?
could be leon's.
uh, yes i, like, do... it's simple. you make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. you press the cd's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
who we got here...?
what did you do?
don't be so sure.
he'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
oh, no you don't!
beth you're losing it.  c'mon.
no. my name is quintero. mister quintero.
good morning madame.
our daughter? is that what you said? our daughter? i mean, you might have a daughter, but i sure as hell don't. and even if i did -- which i don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
no. i know the answer to that one.  i think you'd better take me home.
motion sensors.  looks like zone three.
i know it must be hard. but you have relatives in london --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
more.
no, no.  i on holiday.
so? i'll get bugs ta do it.
what an asshole.
it's the only way it makes sense.
i can only imagine.  you know, i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands.  i don't think he gave it very much thought.
i need to talk to you... doctor. can i come in?
she great or what?
would you like to be modified?
it was only a few times...
why not?
what monster?
have we met?
i don't know... five minutes.
then ask the butler - or someone.
hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: barry the baptist.
it was a nine millimeter.
hey!...i feel something. it's moving!  he's alive!
dad, maybe i shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
oh. so... what brings you down here?
in this violent world, i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
we could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
oh, very good, but very mysterious.  he lives in the emerald city, and that's a long journey from here. did you bring your broomstick with you?
we're out of money, partner.. we wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... how come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  you got two of them...?
packing.
. . . that was quick.
there are?  tell up.  what are they, wise sir bedevere?
wait a minute -- wasn't it stanley who discovered livingstone?
that's what you think?
second most common?
don't let longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will max.
italian.
i didn't say nobody, i said you.
how did you know my name?
you're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  i thought you stopped doing that long ago.
i know! i just had to let one go because i couldn't afford him!
harry, i heard collins has you in some kind of special class.
i hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
no.  are you're leaving?
yeah, i do.
miles davis. "all blues."
yes, sure, that's fine. while i'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick i ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail i ever drank. anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if i did it.  go on! get out! i don't want to talk to you! 
doesn't count.  you gotta say the words.
prints?
it's not your government i'm thinking about. it's your world.
was that about the right angle?
i'm so sorry.
sonny!  could you come out, please? could you come out, please?
seems he's stolen money from them. he's desperate and our only lead.
yeah, downtown.
okay. thanks.
well, maybe they migrate?
said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
that happens.
it's a whatzis?
what is it?
logan, do you see this ring?
it seems we are having dinner by ourselves, miss connell.  but i may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  there -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother paul holland.  but you've already met him.
this is quite a pad you got here, man.  completely unspoiled.
i don't know, i think...
how did you survive?
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
feels different doesn't it?
roseman bridge?
i figure that way we won't get confused.
are you kidding, they love me.  i'm a star, lee.  a god to these people!
that's the way it is.
seems the americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
how long has it been, uncle alfred?
how's he supposed to see the wire?
wait a minute.  now i know where i've heard of you.  you're the gadget guy.
'bout time you got here, buddy.
general mann -- i was told to expect you, sir.  i'm colonel heffner.
what do you have in your purse?
that fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? a guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  you're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for chrissake!  you're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
are you manifesting them?
say anything you want... i know you love me and i love you.
there is nothing to discuss-
go get a bag, man.
do you know what's wrong with you?
...the police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that denzil dowell was shot six times. and two of those shots were in his armpits. brothers and sisters you know why that is?  because denzil had his hands up!!
which examiner did you have? i probably know him.
you expecting somebody you know?
that idea is over now. we're not gonna do that now.
jeez, right, then why don't i do drugs?
are you going to make this hard for me?
...that's what the sister said. the chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
salvy, would i steer you wrong? let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
howard, your one o'clock.
that's all you've got to say?
the whale's mouth?
crikey.
i'm sorry. i couldn't help it.
because is not democrash? all peoples created equal?
it's time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you.  did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
you're welcome.  did you know him?
i was just clearing my throat.
good.  see ya soon.
twelve pack?
well... you control everyone's fate. you're like the puppetmaster.
you guys stay on your bellies.
you don't think i'm kissin' his ass, do you?
i think he means it, this time. i think he'll deal.
do you think you're crazy?
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
who's that?
here.  get off here.
no, david. harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead. the undead.
how long do you live?  i mean, last?
and the father replies?
and what does that make you?
we just can't do it anymore.   this is our chance to get away.
you... you mean...  english bob killed him while...?
whadaya doin', there's no one there!
not at all. lot of potatoes!
it sounds like the name of a mattress store --
all right.  why don't you show me a cheer?
no!
i asked about fredo?
better than most, i suppose.
carrots.
i want all these passages sealed! another stupid idea of my father's! seal them all, every one!
who were the ones you didn't write down from?
montana.  energize.
they're all on microfiche. what year are you looking for?
hey, baby -- i'm gonna retire with you.
come, come, miss science. you've seen worse.
yes.  i thought it was a good idea. we've covered it from the news end, of course.
no, it's all right.
what's that?
well what am i gonna do with it?
the alarm clock.
we've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
whoa.
~e're alive!
cut up a woman. cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, i guess.
few minutes.  want to catch the news.
h'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
'love'?  oh, man, i've got troubles of my own.
you're not gonna be there.
mrs. robinson -- i can't do this.
that's a good idea - telephone the police. the number is spring 3100. get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
...are followin' him around.
i'm all right -- stand by to return fire! mr. scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
whad'ya talkin  about ?
where?
oh! yes. hello.
i knew there was a reason i could afford this.  to the woman of my dreams.. who grows more beautiful....
i think wally will be fine, mrs. worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
what are you doing over there?
like...ah...
hey... is betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
what will it take?  what do you want? just tell me, jimmy!
sulu hikaru.
who?
expensive dresses.  a heart necklace.
there goes a thousand dollars.
you.
how many men?
he deserved it.
do you remember me?
oh yeah?
in front of a little -- it's a bit... you want a mirror?
what'd it say?
i don't know how i could've missed you with that shirt on. it's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. right?
okay, okay.  but if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
there is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
why? what's in lisbon?
sir?
where's the money?
oh, jesus!  you're kiddin'!
roselli?  johnny roselli?
hold the phone!
why does he call sanderson?
most people say the odds are against me.
yes.
hello?
joseph harbin...
shit!
you and i should talk first.
the one you recommended.  in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration.
that's true, otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
i thought you might know her. she was seen here about a week ago. her name is jacqueline gibson.
we can't help *what* they were! forget 'em!
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison.  he can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
don't let the cops provoke you. we're there to watch and take badge numbers...
i was a friend of your sister's.
well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
well, i'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here.
hmmm.
so?
marty. what's for breakfast?
brian i want him out of our car!
that's all taken out of context. okay.
i know.  that's why i want you to be fair with them.
that's why michael and i were the wrong fit.  right from the start.
you're thinking of sleeping with mark tonight?
the <u>orlac</u> claim.
you're doin' lovely, terry, very lovely.
oh, you feel very good, betts. you have such a cosy body. i'm jealous, i'm so skinny.
hello, miss kubelik.
aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
i swear i've aged five years since this trip started.
the gestapo found our weapons. they've arrested janina and andrzej. they're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
of course not. they're possibles. i've checked them against bureau records, check them against your file. how did you get it?
epps?
what the - ? how did you - ?
go in where?
say, boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie.  him and charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
what's the time?
you are a catholic??
jesus christ lady...
you know, all this nightmare we went through with hearst. the whole thing... and in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
if i ever found a girl that could - i'd marry her like that.
i'm too old for this shit.  why the hell am i back in "a" ball?
you know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
there are two more prisoners, admiral. do you want them killed too?  surrender your vessel!
what's that, frank?
what d'you mean?
where did you get this cauliflower?
okay, going up. ice, go high.
i should hope not!
if we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
what...
you don't believe that either, do you? why can't you see my side?
something's wrong.
god knows i would, sir, but i have a previous engagement this evening.
if this is a joke, it's not funny.
like even today.  i woke up this morning, you know?  and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
thank you. yeah, yeah, yeah.
what does she say?  the woman.
we're going to be fine.
that's what i asked.
i thought you'd be off on tour, playing london, paris, new york?
i was just different.
the phone company was broken up.
off the record.
that ain't your daddy, alvinelle. your daddy was hit by a train.
you want me to walk a straight line?
yeah, come on, let's talk.
i'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
board meeting. oh, that means hours, i suppose.
i can't say that i have.
yes, why shouldn't it?
we ain't campin'. we jus' stoppin' a minute--
the clock's already ticking.
if it were up to the doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
the new girl is here.
in fact, i want you to ad lib, that's the magic i'm after. i wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
that she's going to marry somebody else.
c'mere, i want to show you something.
new baby?
mary hates me. i've never been popular with the ladies.
a late night or an early morning?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
really!  listen, heather, i won't take but a minute of your time.  it's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. bob'd love to talk to you.
walter, you fuck!
packed to the ceiling. hurry -- get dressed. and what an audience -- the french ambassador -- american millionaires -- princess ratzville -- er -- er --
i didn't mess things up because i was scared.  i slept with ray because i was sick of you.  and i needed something to snap me out of it.
perhaps i could drop round for tea or something?
lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. will you do that for me, please.
don't think about it.  it's over.
both.
what is it about men and nudity? particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
i don't know - i'm american.
okay.
came to my senses.
as far as they know, that's absolutely true.
i think you'd better go.
i loathe you. you have no manners. and you're arrogant and conceited and... i wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but i tore it up.
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty.
this says "mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck."  that's not true.  i recognized him and i told them so... they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  and here...  ...on the dallas sheriff's report. this is really strange.  see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  that's not my signature. and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  i guess that's all...
how many girls have you slept with?
find out how we can hurt him.  by the end of the day, i want to own him.
<u>me</u>!
thank you.  if you told me two years ago we'd be living here, i would never have believed it.  do you live around here?
ram asked me out, but he wants to double with kurt and kurt doesn't have a date.
but i saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, miss boatwright.
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
yeah.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
are you drunk?
you don't care anything at all about anna, do you?
i didn't like it.
and let my policy expire?  sorry.
hits been hard thinkin' about it. they ain't a day goes by i don't think about it. i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see. hit makes me sad, too. i have bad thoughts on it. i wished they was somethin' i could of did, too. shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. all the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way i see it. i shouldn't of told you about that. a boy ort not hear about such things. it just kindly come out.
i like women who wear mismatched earrings.
yes, yes, the song.  so tell me...has it been...hell up here?
this is a sexy case.
are you hungry?  wanna get something to eat?
to be quite honest it turns my stomach.
ok, whatever you think... i'm lost.
i took the couch.  i had some work to do.  about last night...
yeah.
'twill serve. ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. a plague o' both your houses. they have made worms meat of me. a plague on both your houses! why the devil did you come between us? i was hurt under your arm.
it's alright. this is the only place i can find some peace.
but you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  you're very responsible with ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
...too early...
my pleasure.
no touch. no touch. no touch.
all right.
phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  you'd do well to mind your own business.
i don’t know what you’re talking about!
of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. it's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as d&d mattress man.
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go?
kiss me on the lips.
mr. sampson . . .
look, faz, mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  what was that he said...?
you can call me gloria too.  gloria -- what a beautiful name.  when i was born my mother named me gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. nobody expects you to be what you're not.
where'd y'all go?
that's not true.  i never met anybody named oswald.  anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
huh?
who got the frenchman out?
craig, i want you to meet my old lady, suga.  suga, this is craig.
can we talk later? will you be at the party?
everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
...but there just may not be enough time.  if you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
neosporin?
he's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
no.  it's unhealthy.
we're nearly there, sir.
...no, please.
what are you doing?
cause of the chromium.
how far away is she?
you're soft.
come on, i'll buy you a drink. there's a big thing over at the italian embassy.
any ideas about the colour?
i love your sexy talk. it's so... kindergarten: poo-poo; wee-wee.
well, i -- jerry, the point.  get there.  what does it have to do with the president?
if you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
leave me, lieutenant ! that's an order !
i guess so.
salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
next time, it might be the fbi. the time after that, it might be the president.  but it'll always be someone.  count on it.
not a lot of difference.
i'll need to make a phone call.
perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, lieutenant. there were things i tried to tell you too - about having faith.
there was a guy with melanie?
personally, i would like to surrender. why can we not just surrender?
i told him to leave me alone.
yes. as i said, i was very grateful.
leggo my arm...you look mangier 'n ever.
yes.
i don't want to see people killed any more than you.  but we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
what's this?
would you like to ask them?
that means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
i'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
finally, some common sense...
i know it hurts. but it won't be long. then all the pain will be over. oh, i wish you could hear me. god, give her the ears to hear me so she knows i don't want her to hurt so!
yeah, that's right, laugh. it's so funny, oh it's so funny.  there used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. and white boys are freaks for that shit -
well, maybe i could just start a rumor, then.
i have six hundred. soldiers. and more every week off the boat.
the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
came to get a tan.
our group is full.
if they didn't tell kennedy about track 2, how did hoover find out?
yeah, kayo.
i'll take them all.
what's that?
pulse, slow, very little pressure.
'it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' message, spock?
we can't leave her out there. when the ship launches... she'll be killed.
would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
mr. barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... ace, tell aardvark we're on our way...
father, lad.
they fired you?
i may not be a pro bowler, but i'm no amateur man. sheila moves closer to theo.
let go of my hair.
yeah.  she told me.  you walk her to school.
what you doing around here then?
you're planing something, cathy.. but i won't let you —- i'll warn them against you.
you ready?
i think you were too hard on weathers.
howdy do, dude.
okay, security -- what happened?
not quiet yet.  we know who the gun belonged to. margo west.  she told us this morning.  it doesn't mean much.  mitchell took it away from her.  he had a habit of going through her bag.
you back this mission, and i'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
then where was it?  i'm sent out there... i'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
hi.
uncle birdie!
it's a sign --
so?
you don't think--?
what?
well, i'd best be off.
because i have to.
really bond, couldn’t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
he divorced his wife -- he married marylin -- he divorced marylin -- and he -- remarried his wife? what kind of sick --
you're a dark horse, ripley. engaged?
this tastes weird.  harley? it's me. i need your services. translate that anyway you'd like. i'm at-
doesn't all of this come through to you, eddie? doesn't any of this mean anything to you? that man, this place, the people. they wear masks, eddie. and underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
guess!
hold this.
welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
mmmm.  yes.  i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  i know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
we've touched on this, his own witness has said...
"it's not like we're gonna sell out."
stop it, jez. don't do that.
watch the first step.
-- plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  it's the best deal you're going to get.
you better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'cause she's been good to you.
what did you do after that?
hold on, hot lips.  we got work to do.
agent little weasel, federal bura of your imagination.
was he?
that's worse... just get out of here. walk out, leave everything.
i know you liked ben. i had no right to...
maybe he showed me something.
yes, miss.
sir, the cpu is on-line.
my days are not the old days, genius.
dude, it's not like i haven't been trying to get laid.
i...i have no idea, sir.
kyle?
want a bite?
what does it say?
joe--i'm getting leery of this guy. we keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! i'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from sunday--
are you a 5 or a 6? 
i don't know what that means.  what kind of problem?
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
what's that?
you could sue the shit out of her, ya know. that kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. you could own that fuckin' place.
...snuck in the hospital while i was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
what's so urgent?   you've got me worried.
what's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
mmm.  well, good luck, miss daniels.
we're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night.
don't you think it's time to go now? running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
want to get a drink?
stop. everyone is looking.
do you believe everything that richie tells you?
we~re oetting hammered, jason.  return fire?
with their shields down it might be possible.
we lived in northern minnesota. she went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
otis!
hey, ross.  tell me something.  does pg&e pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
-- what trial?
we're going to steal a ship?  that ship?
foley's got it.
that's the third time he's called today.
like an agent with one client.
because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? i'm buying.
dwayne -
and there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
and if i told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
the old boy shot by the highway?
i have some errands to run, and then i thought we'd spend the evening...
he gave me his card.  'ron johnson, audio consultant.'
mrs. lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
you gave me what?! knots! you gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
hello, sir. it's david.
he must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
hey, ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
what's going on?
<u>i</u> dunno.... ambassador to <u>togo</u>, somethin', <u>i</u> dunno... he...
that's hard to imagine....
hello?
are you shitting me?
not much luggage.
whatever you say.
god, i don't know who's weirder, you or me.
well, thank god we are rid of her at last. and the best thing of all is that she's happy. the little nut is happy, she found mr. right in the nick of time!
shit.
he's *alive*. he still loves you.  so do i.
monsieur blaine, i don't ask you to explain anything.
oh your a pilgrim all right. i saw it on your face back there in the dust. i saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes. would you like a drink? 
that ain't what i mean.
we are being hailed.
yes?
not if we do it my way.
it's not modesty. i just don't try to kid myself.
don't mince words, bones; tell me what you really think.
"klaatu barada nikto."
you are to be reformed. tomorrow you go to this man, brodsky. you wbe leaving here. you will be transferred to the ludovico medical facility. it is believed that you will be able to leave state custody in a little over a fortnight. i suppose that prospect pleases you?
no--i'm sorry. i merely saw him home. i'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. that's mcgann's job.
got that desert yet. gotta take her tonight. take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
what'd you write?
i could go out of town.
look, i'm sorry.
fine, chief.
do i hear a motion seconded?
what if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  i mean, they could be in rio de janeiro.
yeah.
what will it get me?
truth. pure, eternal.  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
let me know when you do, all right?
you are down for protecting malcolm's widow aren't you?
she likes <u>both</u> of us.  we both helped her out.
now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
it'll be heaven!
oh, i don't mind. as a matter of fact, i'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
who's allison?
so it's love which drags you to moscow.
i had a dream about you last night...
what are you doing in there?
what does it look like?  it's an address book!
i missed you, lieutenant.
the hell i don't.
what is this person doing here?
living across the street from a grade school. jesus.
you think someone else caused the accident?
well, i dunno.  i mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
jerusalem is a real drag.  everybody hates me.
i beg you, donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
two.
he tried to kill us.
make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
you know everything i know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then i am and you know it!
historic occasion, isn't it?
that's blackmail.
you want a hit?
what are you doing here?
rob.
what? are you kidding me? who sent you here?
well, press something!
you mean you hauled him all the way out here? just like that?
i thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
i'm sorry ...
well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
what?
my mother -- she lives in detroit. come on now -- give me those stamps.
not yet. he's near "m" and 34th. i've got an elsur unit on the scene now. a residential building. twelve units.
the most logical choice.
who is it?
...you shoot a great game of pool.
i can't do it, ben.
shit!
are you okay?
forget it; i'm suddenly without an appetite.  you're making big trouble, carmine.
huh? oh, geez, mr. hudsucker, i apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i must've mislaid --
i don't know if i want to.
bunker...
no, words. you have never heard words?
dead.
yeah?
you sound like a man with a couple of kids.
did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
true.
god, that's fine.
i don't know, i kind of like wade's idea about the cruise ship.  i've never been to tahiti.
it's okay, he just wanted his machete.
...yeah...
i'll getcha a piece.
jesus christ! an innocent man on death row. a killer still on the loose. kenny, tell me i'm dreaming.
you're not the only one.
don't screw with it. it makes us look suspicious.
you look so well, clair.  a wraith.
i got a trunk in that room. will you get it out for me?
no.
hi, honey.  how was the flight?
do you still want to meet?
i...don't think so.
i just checked "downtown".  quiet everywhere tonight.
benjamin -- i haven't even said i'll marry you yet.
i hope you like large weddings.
well, the thing is, the first death star was manned by the imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were imperials.
pretty much.
take your eyes off her, oleg!  look.  it wasn't my fault you two were caught.  it's his fault.  trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  i wasn't going to wait!!!
i'm going home.
that's easy. me.
really. and where was that, old man?
thanks for your help, carl. sorry we woke you up.
mother, i ...
did you need something?
you must know i always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
right.
well, your mother's going to pta today.  we'll see what your teacher has to say. 
where?
he sells bmw's?
it's worse than war. it's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
you never took a fucking vacation in your life, harry. what's going on?
it's thanksgiving.
why wouldn't she tell me? there's no way! she could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
what now?
you could have a great beach house for that.
eric!!!!  you need to be rehabilitated. help me to help you!
or what? or what?
you hear me talkin' to you.  the only time you come up here when something is wrong.
supper. hana calls after him.
don't worry.  i plan to have something within twenty-four hours, john.
so, bill, if i understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
hello?
i 'm handling the fine stuff. you're back up all the way...
good morning, mr. president.
at least one.
could i see some identification, sir?
sure. i can follow that.
can i ride one sometime...?
correct.
miss ratched. given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that i can speculate on, at this late date, is how i will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
i haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
i've never weighed 135 lbs.!
...i didn't recognize you without the smock. did i--damn--did i leave something at the shop?
what are you afraid of?  nobody's asking you to have a baby.  this is just to get out of town. the minute we hit florida, we'll blow this set-up.
... that's what you told us to say.
do it.
are you safe?
i know. 
yeah, or turn you into toast.
maybe i'm just not ready for that yet.
leave me alone, jude.
all of us did. there was this whole line of people... whole line of ceos up there all swearing.
you're darned tootin'!
he's a decent fellow, the president, isn't he?
hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim ass first up main street?
why'd we have to leave so fast?
you're a considerate young man.
please.
would you like to talk about this friend?
good night.
so...would you object if i said you're quite striking?
i wonder if his cabin is still available?
so he has no idea what's about to happen?
no!
look at the way the little punk is driving.  he's all over the place.  look-- he hasn't signalled once.
so even though i can't make any promises, well--i figured if you asked me real nice--i might just be willing to talk about it again.
they're going to kill me next. that's what i hear. these new indians are destroying everything. our people are a quiet people.
pretty.  she's a blond.
you din't have no 1, 2, 8.
is that you, roby?
how do you know?
does she suffer?
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
dr. lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density.
this isn't rare!
it was a condition of getting doug out.
we did it.
mom?
what is going on?
and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  it unifies the entire world on a single level. everything is completely connected. sometimes i can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  it's really wonderful.
you should feel lucky.  ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
i need you to believe in me.  to believe that we can do this.
do you really think he'll show up?
what are you talking about?
what??
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
oh. oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think i'm awfully stupid. he slaps alex in the face.
flowers. that's funny.
oh?
lemon?
could take a little while, though.
i understand...
what color was it?
i hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
chapter and verse.
i got it.  don't know why i bother.  it's been broken for two years.
yes, you certainly will. and you'll find a nice girl and rebuild america. just the way it used to be.
i'm sorry, but it's important.  clay shaw is important.  i'm sorry.
yeah, i know.  i was just leaving. why were you trying to reach me?
and this butterfield guy--
i'll call.
proprietor of a london firm.  of longstanding.
let's go, for christsakes...
imonna find out one way or the other.
have you ever been caught?
call that number.
sidney remains optimistic.
for us, kate.
i don't want to cause any trouble.
i don't know.  he took it hard.
what about schulz?
major, those are my boys out there dying.
it can't be.
i apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and i figured...
when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  we're breeding them for submission.  soon they will be fully domesticated.
i love you bob. i really do. forgive me?
no, really?
yeah. so why you look do down?
man, that weed knocked christine on her ass. she's sleeping like a baby stella.
who else is left?
nope.
i think what my most insightful friend is saying, mr. president, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
if our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
yes, desperately.
what's a butfor?
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
call german.
my assistants, i presume.
how was the flight, champ?
he isn't to be touched.
well, what do you do?  do-do-do you talk to holly, or lee, or what?  do you, do you, do you phone them?
what gave me away?
must i speak to you in french?
oh, no, my young jedi. you will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
okay. go on.
<u>i'm</u> making the run to the cat.
damn! that must be about as far north as you can get.
go!
sheriff buddy was a different story. long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. that sheriff wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
i've got a present for you...
okay, ray. i'm coming in. if he starts to leave the area, move in. and hold him. over.
yes, i guess.  yes.
they don't have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you're the only one in town that can help me.
the hearing's tomorrow. if she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
we have to get going.
but, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
smack him back.
could i see you a minute?
why do you want to go to paris?
sure.  and the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  nearly snapped me in half.
well, i don't know. that depends.
the police still have a lot of questions for russell nash.
are you sure?
hey, mark. is that you?
where are you headed?
you didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
you were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
...that's a good motto.
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside, i'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
now look, did you buy anything?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
all right. let's all go back in. adam? you're cool right?
no! do they show you having sex?
--and he says chapin hired segretti--
what'd you come back for?!
that tape sucked, by the way!
how?
you just say. i'm not really --
very funny.
everybody loved joey. from the little kids to the old rummies.  did you know him very well?
uncle terrence.
i've had time to get over it. she was killed by wolves they think.
picture it... i feel like i gotta share this with somebody.  it's too perfect.
ok. mister stansfield, norman stansfield.
with much bloodshed.
anybody talk to the press?
you can't play around with these tent people.
i've never seen anything like it.
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
really.
why you gotta be an asshole chuckie?
i-i-i'm w-w-wet...
like what?
it's about to work, just come on.
i've heard the name.
that's not enough.
we just got a gold record.
listen up, dewey, because it's bad. real bad. aircomp just faxed us. the calls were listed to neil prescott -- sidney's father. he made the calls with his cellular phone. it's confirmed.
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some.
i just came from the school, madam. i don't know about their brain pans but...
he couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. yet another mistake for "mr. fantastic."
spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
what sales...?  i just closed eighty-two grand...are you fuckin'...i'm back...i'm back, this is only the beginning.
what's going on?
but not in the investigation of a major crime, i hope.
i'm not so sure of anything as you are, john book. you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  just as i could live yours!
but it has. there is no more to tell.
so they're airing this tonight?
pearl and john!
what was that?
a film case.
are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
watch it!
bojo called. said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
okay... so i'll see you tomorrow. let's not drag this out. we don't enjoy another that much.
here ya go, convict. we cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. what you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
you don't understand.  i recognized his face now come on.
...they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen' or the 'ice princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. like it hurts my feelings.
it's such an honour for us to have you here, herr mozart. and for gertrude.
our little island seems to agree with you....
it's good to see you.
yummy. carl says if i lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the university of maryland fall mixer.
next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
that's the colt .25 -- a fine little gun. don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the devil. handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. i'll throw it in for another $125.
bandit, i just thought i'd lay a smokey report on you.
i know...  but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world.  some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh.  i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
no, thanks, man. we got to head out.
oh.  oh.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean anything.
oh. okay.  i'll catch ya tomorrow then.
we can't go on this way. i just can't go on living with you. not this way.
kate.  thank god you're there. i need help.
no, no, i don't. i'm just beginning honestly. sorry, carry on.
what've you got for me?
then as knight to knight i can offer you mercy.
then tell her i'll come by in the morning. we need to talk.
charlie, don't do anything.  promise me?
all i know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. then, his fail-safe system was activated...
what can that gun of yours do?
do we have characters?  how about honeycutt, snowflake, rastus, nigger, jim, sambo, jungle bunny, and how could we forget aunt jemima.
look, i'm very sorry i came off sort of nutso. i'm not really.
yes?
of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
before what?
you?  what about me?  i’m working hard for you here, jack.  on christmas too!  now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  i was moved...
because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  and he's only waiting for one thing:  that some god up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?
it's not enough.
good heavens, are you married, madox?
but you can do the same thing in six months.  the next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
it's been quite a night. i understand that your understudy - miss harrington - has given her notice.
not a lot.  i saw inside of the science center.  what exactly happened?
but you know what i'm talking about, don't you?  about glenn, don't you, and the second car?
the murder of a president, bill, is a crime in orleans parish too.  i didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
where is he? where is rob?
we've got no option.  we're gonna have to get it off.
oh soph, joe loves kids.  joe wants kids. joe thinks he needs kids.
all set?
john, where's your folks?
this isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. there's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in new york is reading it now. so if you want me to burn it, fine. you're not ridding the world of anything.
i understand.
you've got quite a temper.  it's better this way.
how can you look at it so clinically?
that's all right.  well, we'll be going.
he's right, kate. daddy's dead! he was too far away. if flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, i'd fling it. the only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
am i a prisoner?
but don't pull that again.
we've got to get cathy.
i know. they're rich drug addicts and celebrities. when i saw james taylor there, and --
please forgive me. because i like you. i don't think of you that way. but i'm mixed up.
here --   come on.
take the money and walk away!
and speaking of which, you have those market share charts mr. shackley was asking about?
mrs. kane would like to see you, mr. kane.
your name. and --
this band sounds terrible.
it was different then.
it's a really nice place you have. is the rent high?
no way! he just called him a dick.
kristen's story really got to her.
whatever you say...sis.

well, unfortunately denning's not here to tell us, but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
what's the story?
hey, mama. hey, vaughan.
do you want me to say i'm sorry?
people, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- iowa, wisconsin, north dakota...
glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, fettes, not a soul around for miles.

mary clarence!
"half?"  what did you, take a nap in math class?  three people, three shares, one third.  four point six six six repeating.

i just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
now your signature.  not "dickie". your signature.
no argument, just do it.  that's a command!
your memories are repressed. they're trying to break through. relax. try to remember-.
a few more moments, still in this business.  then i'd find you.
he's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies. here's how we play. i ask you a question. you get it right, your girlfriend lives. you answer wrong, she dies.
thank you.
yeah?
you do not want to be here.  go home to your father.
shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
that's right.  they called us the "three musketeers."
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me.
andy.
hi ya, big boy? how's it goin'? like it in here?
i guess.
then what are you hiding?
yeah, they's good all right.
that's the shape my hand's gonna be when i hold that thing. you understand? i'm not leaving here without it.
he had girlfriends!
i'll do it.
is it enough?
just dropped in to pay my respects.
the heels on these shoes are very large.  why have i never noticed this? the heels on these shoes are grotesque.
let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. it's friends that count. and i got friends.
or wound.  let them keep their eyes and fingers.
i'm all right, mom. i'm not in siberia, you know.
no wonder he passed away.  i'd like to be with you to the very end. can't you see what i'm trying to tell you -- i love you.
what do i want to do?
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
i don’t know what your problem is, but...
our cars were seen together in felton.  they're calling me an accessory to murder.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? this is a... why? why would you do that?
how's kip?
have they done blood tests on him?
it wasn't a suicide attempt.  i regret ever saying that.
some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
okay, knock it off.
listen, we just met for crissake! i'm not that kind of girl!
thank you. so were you.
what you think?
no...look i'm busy...
give me a cigarette.
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke.
don corleone, i wish you let me know you was coming.  we could have prepared something for you.
i don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? her name's kristen, but i suppose you've never seen her?
i have not been able to face him yet.
i stopped by your office. henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the bugler.
liz, listen, the doctor's here and i just can't, uh... talk now... so --
maybe she tripped.
your princess is really a winning creature. a trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
myers?
but what can i say to her, sir?
oh. i didn't know. i'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  you'll miss a great meal and i'll keep the scarf, anyway. what's your name?
i don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
and how many soldiers do you have?
he was afraid of you. he knows a tough guy when he sees one.
that was fast. well, did you at least enjoy it?
is that nietzsche?
remember that upside down flag back at jimmy's house? somebody took it down.
hey man.
well?
why, sure, ethan...there's just the one thing we're after...finding deborah and lucy...
i thought you met someone else.
let's talk about you for a change.
we have to prepare you for an audience with sophie.
mookie, i always liked you.  not the smartest kid, but you're honest. don't make me dislike you.
then its authority is in doubt.
oh... wandering about.
we're not all frigid.
and you don't deal drugs?
i met you at my father’s funeral.
oh, it's so soft.
hello?
the money? why?
sure does. but i'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
very outspoken, too. said i looked funny. wasn't that cute?
this isn't random or light. someone made amistake...!
we ran up against a platoon of soldiers. there were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
you'd make it. he's just getting to the girls. come on, zack. i gotta see my family, man. i couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
you told me that on parents' weekend. remember? wait, that wasn't me. or you.
what do you mean?
...how old are you?
ahhhhhh!
yeah, heh heh. i think i just had an accident. heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
in that case, here are ten basic plays. i think that's about all this bunch can handle.
i've already formulated a plan.
i see...
for real?
every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
...we goin'?
thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. so i left the bottle out as bait.
no, he's ruining yours.
he's scared.  it's crazy.  i never met anyone like him.  his wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  his mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. unbelievable.  i wanted to get married ... he didn't really want it ... he's married already!  but he did it.  i don't know why.  i thought it would help me, but it didn't.  i was just as confused and unhappy was before; i did terrible things.
there ain't no possums in this woods tonight, daddy.
ma -- is she? --
what you thought!?  what you thought...i'm a workingman, i'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...

who's he?
doesn't everybody?
but superman isn't an average man.
ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  you could choke on the diesel smoke already!
what's outside of pleasantville?
you're full of shit.  do you understand what i'm saying to you? full of shit?
you're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  the power's coming back!
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  so were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
getting ready to invade.
in case we want to switch nights.
we need to talk.
gal, you ain't right yet.
...well bart, which is it? orphan? dame?
i don't know.  where are we going?
...uh ... no, that's...
yeah. you.
well what do you want to talk about?
it was nobody's fault.
yeah, can i help you?
naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole.
maybe you should back off.
sshh.
i thought you'd forgotten about me.
come in.  hi.
it's nothing.
i couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...jesus, i'm starting to believe in god and what's worse i think i like the guy. the lightning bolt was just a test, right?  wendy and i--we're meant to be. i'm right, right?  i have to see her...
i was, but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  only here isn't where i left it, is it, bud?
kalen...
look, i know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but i'm different, i never talk to strangers, all my life i've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but i do and if you walk away now i'll never see you again or you me. you'll grow old.
it is insane.
is he all right?
... movie.  that's your problem.  you don't want to be in love.  you want to be in love in a movie.  read it to me.
she's in a great deal of pain.
i'm trying, david.
you amaze me, commander.
shhhh!  roach, shut the fuck up.
your job is done.  you interfere with the living again.
...a mrs. doneghy called... i told you that.
you gotta be kidding me. this chick is wasted.

my fight's not with you, holliday.
they've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
so josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
dude finlay?
maybe i don't like the way you ask.
we got time off for good behavior.
so ... how's the food over there in china, mr. nixon?
a hunting accident is perfect.

i spoke to your father the other day.
where's the gangsta of love?
look at that!
what are you talking about? you think i invited them?
what are you saying?  oh, god -- you're going on assignment again ...
what, sir?
really? can i see it?
you maniac.  you'll blow your scholarship.
what did security say?
you have no idea what you've done to me, do you? and after you leave, i'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. if anything happened at all! and i'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
danny!
pop, there's no way an ivy league team is going all the way.
were you right? spock? v'ger is a living machine...?
you're a fool.  now put her back.
jesus.
what exactly you doing, john?
well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. it'd be a big help.
tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
who, dorothy?
you may not care a lot about this place, alice, but i mean to make it my whole life. it's been my whole life. gimme a chance. stay a week. help get it ready. next friday, if you're not happy, i'll put you on the bus myself. i'll be grateful.
hey. you ok?
that's our case!
yeah, yeah. it goes "perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines"?
wait.
this is a great young out-of-work actress.
you know.  if we hook up, tomorrow i'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
you son of a bitch. you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
i'm sorry i left you hanging up there.
no, baby. you're money.
nobody but you can do that to me. i don't know why.
screw scholarships!   universities are death!  they make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  burn 'em down, i say!

i... i saw him out the window.
... come in, please. this is reliant calling regula i. repeat. this is uss reliant --
well, don't worry about your fiancee.  we'll watch over her.
well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
not the way i did it. i was loaded half the time. i don't know how you could change bedpans sober. i used to hang out with this guy, glenn. he was an x-ray technician or something.
shep, sit...sit! so, i understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...so where is he?
sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
i didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
you know alfred.  he'd never say anything.  but i can tell.  until you came along, alfred was the only family i ever had.  without him, i don't know how i would have survived.  he saved my life, dick.  and i've never told him.
yes, sir.  you're just what we needed on a night like this.
but i want to stay.
what?
can i stay a bit longer?
anything.

or get eaten alive.
well, i've not brought them.
jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? are you alright?
i know you. you don't think i know you're on the take. this whole fucking precinct is dirty. you don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

i don't believe you.
to chocolate?
your body is the temple of the lord.
it ain't been a good day, chief.
well?
i just wondered. why were you trouble?
i mean, the whole sanitation thing. joseph lister... 1895. before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
who?
i know perfectly well how little i can do. what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
what do you do?
i didn't turn her into mother. you did.
zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
what about the guy you lobotomized...did he get a refund?
my employer.

who's the squirt?
we've got to keep moving while there's still light.

the men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
veil nebula.
you -- think i am -- i'm --  -- an animal.

spock...  what have you done to my friends?
what do you want?
she say where he is?
we know how this craft got here. where it's been.
what's the matter?
i don't want to erase anything.
what the fuck is that?!
victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  he says, quote, "i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  he's the best tenant i've ever had.
oh, thank you, darling.
no, i want to keep my room, and get another one.

whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
jason, i'm going back to highcliffe. i came to say good-by.
why would i kill her?
oh, you're not so badly off. there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
on channel 10?
did she hurt herself?
look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
tell me. don't lie, or i'll know.
why?
kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  you're a rational person. you're a trained psychiatrist.  you know the difference between what's real and what's not.
thanks for the halo, james, but i've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
well, that was a very promising start. by my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. yes? dr. brodsky's pleased with you. now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
don't be witty.  yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. why did you stay on the bus, walter?
dorota!

i know that.  i'm just -- i'm nervous.  i reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. i know they're song lyrics.  and i know how i feel.
i need a favor... i need you to trace a number for me.
okay, okay...
what are you still doing here, randall?
he's not there.
that bad?
but you're sure?
so if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  but things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
i've been thinking about that, about you and karen.
look he figured it out !
i think we should go.
do you still think the joker cares about money??
when it's a threat, you'll know it.
your majesty.  this ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of paris -- we have no way of checking --
well...
the chamber has been accidently uncovered!  you must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and ivan is released!
and this is my son, paul.  he was only four years old when his father disappeared.
and the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?

i'm afraid i've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
i can't talk right now.
shit. i dunno. how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
and without much discrimination.
michael, what are you doing?
i'm sorry about your friend. i had a friend in swat killed. i know how it can be.
hurt her?  hell, it killed her!
let me pass!
a p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
why you brought glenn into this, i'll never know.
i've got my duties to attend to.
either way works for us...
spock...
what are you looking at?
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
would you?
know what you mean, blair.  trust is a tough thing to come by these days. just trust in the lord.
how's the new one coming?
hello again, neighbour. i didn’t intrude, did i?
that idiot!
i can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"ladies and gentlemen	of the jury... the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people. they, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
you think he's got any herb?
okay.  then i'll go.
someone's bringing in a kitten...?
they musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
but i'm wild at heart.
carla jean...

don't give me that! <u>not another</u> <u>word</u>! when you had the fat lady in there, and i asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. so as far as i was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. and if the king of fucking england had walked in & told me different, i wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time i've been looking for jake, this is only the second time i've even gotten a whiff of him.
i've been buying you stuff all week. i've been buying him stuff all week.
i can't figure out why he's doing it. he's been richard taupin at least since 1967.  and the guys rich.  you should see the stuff he has in that shop.
no thanks, i've seen seattle.
i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. maybe an even hundred.
y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
joe koehler.  i know him.  he's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.

i don't really like your friends either.
aren't you gonna answer that?
west.
baldwin -- his name is.
that's what happened. in fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. she'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. she was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. so, she said no. and the guy says, "look, i really love you, and i wanna prove it. so have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, i can never get any of your money, and i'll sign it." so she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. and once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
... joe? who's joe?
i just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. maybe i better go.
i don't know. an open grave. i stand by the gravestone looking down into it. and it's my grave.
because i'm getting fat.

poor brad.
and this is your house.  wow.  the house of frankenstein.  i thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
don't get mad, but i just went for a little stroll through the company switches.

...so although their dad said, "don't get out of the car until i get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "run to my voice - and don't look back."  the twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  ah!  they jumped, diane!  they jumped!
don't ever do that again.
well, hell, you got the whole chicago south side.  how do ya expect the eight lousy spots i've got to compete with that?
i thought i'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
i feel strange being here with you... without david knowing.
it's like being a producer, mr. moss.  the things in trouble.  somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  you get the actors get up there, and strut and <u>posture</u>.  but somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and save the thing.

men don't win fights with women, son, i'll tell you about that sometime, too. in the meantime, i've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. under no circumstances will i be angry with you. this is a total get-out-of- jail-free card. ready?
you're it.
you steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. but these tapes. he's never going to stop looking for us.
how's it working, scotty?
there's fight club in delaware city.
he's...he's very nice.  but mrs. carver, the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands. please, you have to help me.
we have to go into that cabin and search it, sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
having a good time, vivian?
flight is a scientific impossibility.
aye?  then she's obviously not got enough to do.
i know a very good dentist.
jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, i can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. you have only to drink a little.
and but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
my group we need some exposure. was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
uh-huh. so what are you doing here?
i bow to your expertise in these matters.
so we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
no...
sir?
well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, woody.
it's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
christ, i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and i tell myself i could be worse.  it's just so damned pleasurable.
something went wrong. system malfunction. explosion. mrs. peel had a narrow escape. suspected sabotage. nothing proven. file still open.
it's really you, isn't it?
a vulgar term, but yes.
one hundred thousand?  that's it? jesus... is that a lot?
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates...
epps, i don't think he's slowing down.
you know who the mayor was?
that's what the two policemen said, sir.
thirty -five years!
praetor...
where is she?
you kept it?
his dry cleaners.  you want him?
you were the admitting nurse at st. catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night deborah ann kaye was admitted...
yes, sure, we did go to san remo. that was months ago.
a ship,
i'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
all you all right?
guilt?
may i see your license?
what next?  you leave promptly, of course.  there is no question as to whose home this is--
but father, it's not fair.
shit.
you get her?  okay.  well, i need a lot. i need more than usual.
you can hardly get your arms around me. how depressing. you're so early.
now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. our situation has changed considerably. before i had only a claim to the jewels. now i have the jewels.
you know where the guards are. you know how to get in and out. you know where the money is.  we're taking down that casino, convict. you're the guy gonna tell us how.
solis said to keep you clear of this.
good news. you're going back to school.
in other words, god works in mysterious ways...
she's just no good.
cool. i don't get guys who wear boxers. my ex wore boxers. i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
now, stop fucking around. the others, the old ones?
you have no reason to feel ashamed. you haven't said anything you don't have a right to. and if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
mrs. williams? thanks for the cake.
i opened thousands of brains.
i found a lid. it was laying on the ground over there.
so can we consider you a regular, sir?
why worry? you'll like it. nothing in the world like a mace high. forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
it's important.
accused. not indicted. he resigned the firm. divorced nineteen seventy. galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. since then he's been on his own. four cases before the circuit court. he lost them all. he drinks.
where?
but you promised!  i've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
why?
i thought we had to meet the man.
i didn't think so.
fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
ucla? my cardigan sweater period.
well! come on!
the husband steps outside; relinquishes his bride; we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride. 
if you wouldn't mind.
i'm telling you it's a forgery. the paint's still wet for god's sake.
why her?
well... i still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
the day wasn't so bad.  we all got through it all right.
you worm!
so i hear.  even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
were you in jail?
i have waited long for you. once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. why am i served from the chalice?
why, you're the preacher!
blow.
aces full.
how long ago?
hal will have my head for this.
up.
hasn't affected his work, though.
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
what?
i'm an old friend of the mayor's.  i just want to say hello to him.
i'm gonna put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you.
vanderbilt's not that far from u of m.
if i find out that you had anything to do with this, i will have you sacked.
oh, yeah.  damn.  my watch is busted.
where are you going?
please don't scream at me. i like you, but i don't like the way your attitude is.
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, tony walked me home from school. he was my first boyfriend.  i was fourteen.
and?
follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
i can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  don't keep me in suspense.  what year?
tomorrow i go with vince.
she's very striking, don't you think? are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
all right, old man.  christ.
think i could have them back?
then what is it?
rennie...what'd they do to you??
no, you don't understand -- i don't want to get out!  i want to get in?
uh no. i think i'm gonna get out while i'm ahead.
so...you...survived the blast, did you?
nothing, nothing... look, i live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
who's heller?
two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  baked or fries?
no, it was open. it wasn't locked.
wyatt, i... i ain't got the words.
come on. he's a crook.
by hand. like the pioneers did.
sons of bitches!
for me? better feel sorry for yourself, sandman!
well... thanks, anyway.
i've loved you for a very long time. i'm sorry! i shouldn't have said that.
he sleeps quietly. he died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, drossos, like his father before him.
practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
yes it is...we did this.  we changed everything.  i've been having bad dreams, johnny. dreams where i die...in the fire.  i was supposed to die in that warehouse.
pappy o'daniel be laughing' then.
yeah?
where's the fire sweetheart? don't know how they work things in nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
<u>you</u> called <u>us</u>, doctor hudson.
luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
she's at work.  i'm her mother.
you're a liar!
here's the picasso. is he in his room?
that's right... .
he has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  he gave dorothy a coach- and-six.  that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  faith, the business was well done.  your cousins, michael and harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to england, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to dublin.  are you in want of cash, my boy?  you may draw upon me, for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
so you don't want to fuck.  that's what you're telling me?
forget it.
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane.
my door is always open.
you couldn't.
you ratted on my mother??
well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
ya sister knows i'm comin'?
so your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
no, thank you, really, mrs. pilletti.
easier said than done.  we saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
what are you talking about? you were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
think you could learn?
puttin' in soem late hours, i see.  if you're trying for o.t., you're in the wrong place.
so you haven’t seen the film, then?
i look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- hiya, marty...
where to?
i thought so.  because, one time?  i was at this --
i can't get over you two. she was asking about you earlier, rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
good.
but dick laurent is dead, isn't he?
spunk, come back...
i never saw anything like it. how did she pick him up so fast?
yeah.
-- leo was an apple, that's right. red on the outside, white on the inside. and jimmy hated him. kicked his ass a coupla times. but he didn't kill him.
you in a mood, susie, to run over to milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
you and frank ever take a vacation?
caesar, what happened?
i don't, i don't remember. what do i owe you?
yes, that's true.  we have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
deep and slow, big guy.  deep and slow.  just breathe easy.
what for?
he is dead?
we're in a shootout, roy! shut up about the damn fish!
you don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
good enough.  and unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
your writing. it's amazing, josie. you're really talented. and far less depressing than dorothy parker.
god, there's lester...
speak english.
sorry.
whoís dead?
there's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
what now?
maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that polly perfect shit.
dutiful citizens, you have something which i have waited years for.
i believed in you...
j.j., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...i'd rather have my freedom.
you're like new york. you're an island.
well -- i, uh, that is to say mr. dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart -- uh, massey.
yes?
outta here?
you think he's bluffing?
your honor, i know as much about these gangs as anyone; i'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... i assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
thanks for picking me up.
come in, mother bird, this is alpha bravo.
you can trust me.
that gives you an idea of what i'm up against!
you make the plate?
any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
what'd ned say?
the deflector shields are gone.
but tell me --
i can't believe this is happening. i'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
any ideas yet?
what are we going to do!?
stay with him.
i remember. you could do that, couldn't you? go down on me?
what?
listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
he's leaving the country.  and i don't give a shit.
what are you thinking?
that's what it says.
i said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
what?
where the hell have you been, junebug?
jesus christ!
leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
i think i've got something to say.
walter...stay away from me!
it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. that's what you projected on the bridge.
oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
no. if anything, after i looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. it had character, you know?
their loads are poly-drug.  "e" from holland, methamphetamine precursors from jordan, afghan "h." mid-ocean transshipments.  his real business is:  he's a network.
tormented -- ? why?
you play the cello!  it's my favorite instrument.
i've got a lock!  there!
hopefully, very soon.  i'm just awaiting the final okay from mr. feldman at mgm.
you know who i can do without? i could do without the people in the video store.
i mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  oh god! i am just so personally horrified right now ...
ion drive will engage in... t-minus ten minutes.
we were just going to bury him when you came along.
didn't she ever tell you about that? god, she really is pathological...
always.  ever since the day i died.
why didn't you tell us?  why didn't you tell us?
shut up.  here's to a great week.
we're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
listen, willie. do exactly what i tell you now.
well, if it must be, it must.  for a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw.  no officer, bearing his majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and best is a huge, strong fellow.
oh, please.  i asked you because i thought you might actually be worth going with.  but you are just a jock. no wait.  you're a jerk.
hey, what's the rush?  c'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
why is she in a wheelchair?
didn't you go to sleep at all, karl? you been sittin' there like that all night?
'that right? good for you.
i know first aid!
you don't think i'm smart enough to be serious about.
i am, i think.
excuse me, "sir".  i thought we spoke as equals.
nay.  that's but to distract the casual visitor.  a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
take the hood off, fergus --
and bring the cocktail shaker.
i'm sorry for the screw-up. but i couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. i couldn't help it i had to stop at penny's for the costume. and you were hungry, remember.
yes, stop!  i wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  what's wrong?
they lied.
i'm sorry, i don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
dead poets honor.
well then i guess i can skip it. heavens to betsy, wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
of course it's true - and he knows it.
yes he did.  yes he did. barnes looks at the monitor - taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
what's goin' on?
then hang up!  do it!
then let's not name the thanksgiving turkey, okay? i assume you still got a shiv.
okay.  after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the cpc.  here it is.  ten packages from the same sender.  baku. delhi.  st. petersburg.  the guy was a real road warrior.  this package was kuala lampur.  no activity in his account after this package.  no forwarding addresses after k.l.
i'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
you don't? what happened to muff?
you mean that leaves miss hall.
he flies as well, then . . .
oh. gary's loudmouth.
how are you doing?
whatever happens... we're going all the way.
god, no!  nothing like that.  no, he died before i was born.  he died in vietnam.  i never knew him.  never met him.  we don't even know the details.  i dream of battlefields.  of searching. of trying to find out.
i'll explain someday.
i picked the wrong number when i chose you ... didn't i?
daniel.  listen --
all right, then.  he's interested in you for your conversation.  we know what a great talker you are.
well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, azteca...
that way, huh?
it may make very fine poetry, mr. hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
listen up, huh? even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
status?
no, about... are you talking about duane cooley?
no, z.  the squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  you're a good ant, z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  i don't wanna see anything happen to you.  so quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
can't say.
you sure?
i want a raise.  and benefits.  including dental.
but that's what happened before.
tawny i think i'm going to be sick.
sick?  how sick?
so i guess that's it.
which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  these are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
that's the way i see it, too.
this done happen before. it ain't nothin' -- i just have to wait a minute or two.
almost done.
shut your mouth!
i'm just sad ben -- i mean it was... you were, but, you know. i just don't know...
you sure you outta be playin, around with that?
it's the middle of the night.  they're asleep.  phone didn't wake them.
mcmanus wants to go in shooting. i said no way.
you don't think...
thought i'd have a go at building the birdhouse on saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
greetings, everyone.
ben, come in.
yes, it just shows—  i don't know why i'm talking to you. i don't know you. who are you?
his twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
up yours.
that's not what i'm talking about.
no, i don't and i oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and i would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  the field's all planted, so i guess i can spare you for a little while. when do you wanta leave?
hey – it's the big a.m..
where?
yeah?
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on, the waste - i'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away.
it's twelve o'clock.
right.
objection. the accused is indeed a man. therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
i saw that.  she kissed you, didn't she? you played it cool, though.  walking away, never looking back.
well this hasn't happened yet.
i understand bobby beans came to see you today.
you sound worried.
i'm fine.  nothing's wrong.
can i help you?
oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  we're going someplace you never been before.
you're here... i'm a bit surprised.
parking tickets ? that's it ?
it'll just be me.
i do it because i love you.  because everybody i loved you.  mommy -- wher- ever she is -- susan, quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
is it over?
what's that?
maybe you'll catch it.
you sure? maybe that's the kind of friend i am.
i can't let her down now, archie.
are your parents alive?
finding the real world to your liking, mr. carter?
now--now--please--that's quite all right. relax, boys--
oh, you know, i, i love that book you lent me.  the easter parade? you were right.  it had very special meaning for me.
-- simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day, mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
you like it?
i don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
the reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description, and i'm supposed to follow it, right?
you said.
no, man. i need to use the phone.
mose...try to remember!...you were in scar's camp...
good seeing you again.
i know. he sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
m-m-mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
yeah, i do. it's for my girl friend. make it out to ralph.
any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
i blew it, dr. lester.
look, i really don't have that much time...
i guess you won't be coming home tonight.
roy?  your clock broke.
you shouldn't get mixed up in this.
devoted entirely to the interests of all the john does all over the country. which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. he will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. a man whom he, personally, recommends. a great humanitarian; the best friend the john does have.
man, i ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
where are we going, jeff? not back to that leaky boat --
i want you to go back to new hampshire...think things over.
oh.  oh, that's good.
i don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
they'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. and if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. we'll get 'em all right. i gotta piss. i'm gonna use your commode.
why's that?
okay - got light duty, three days.
right away.  will you have something, mr. thompson?
one hundred books?
no, nothing, sorry.
you know what, i'm just gonna crash.
does that look at all suspicious to you?
i don't feel like it right now.
big ed’s?  big ed’s tires?  why...?
they're all divorced?
we haven't anything to discuss with you. we'll talk to a lawyer!
is there a problem, george?
... like prince charming.
oh. well i am.
if you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re-runs of the twilight zone.  seriously.  i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
we should remind viewers that truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
that's it?  that's all you have to say?
captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
right.  okay, then.  shall we go?
really?
hey veronica, how'd that teenage prevention t.v. suicide thing go?
you didn't know? but then why did you... well, don't worry. it's relatively mild.
i'll destroy them when we get back to paris.
buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, i don't want to talk to you. i'm going out and sweep the patio.
i never imagined i'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  it's over, isn't it?
a few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
mikey--
i understand.
our friends in little russia.  go in and ask for a man named dmitri.
ryan, you've got to come!  you've got to help me find the dog!  i let their dog out.  we need to find the dog.
alexander pope?
i admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. and another. a nest of them. where's your nest, taylor? where are your women?
there's three thousand crowns, it's all i got.
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
she's out.
a new <u>take</u> on the...  well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
excuse me, steve.  i said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
and i suppose you're the knight.
this.  whatever it is.
if i had to guess, i'd say the blackouts are stress related.
working elevator.  mr. pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
man, act like this is your home.
where the hell are they?  hope they didn't wise up.
you really don't remember?
he wouldn't say.  edward... i think we got him.  his nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  you there?
i'm off. there's food in the fridge.
it's marvosa -
i'm lucky they don't knock down the building. it could happen anytime. and everything worth remembering is right here.
cooch.  where the fuck did they send us?
i couldn't get it to go down.
i think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, i wonder if it's not too much for her.
well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
good night. can i kiss you on the cheek, too?
we never should have done this to him...
no, jakie, no. i-i-i-
i'm not giving up.
the bay of pigs? ... that was kennedy's screw-up.  how does that threaten us?
some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now i'm supposed to be her baby's daddy.  anyway, i told your mom i wanted to be the one who told you.
are you saying she was-
did you get my letter, mare? the one about ted?
i was lucky in the order.  i always been lucky killin' folks.
you cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, jack.
kevin.  how's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
you wait and see. you're going to marry a big hero!
chris macneil?
...where?
she's from connecticut. she belongs to his stupid country club.
the great bill parrish at a loss for words?  the man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course truman's father, kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman.
yes, mr. hillyer, i am.
what i'm asking isn't impossible. my daughter is somewhere between here and miami. i want her found!
no, leavenworth.
let's rest a minute.  i'm so thirsty.
look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. it becomes what he is. why fight it? what do you know? how long you been a hack, a couple months? you're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  the first time they meet ...
so -- how far are we from the campus?
well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
i want your d.o.r.
quite an achievement...
ellie, you know i think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  we can afford it now.
not from me. i only stole it. when are you coming over to the chamberlain's men?
you're drunker than i thought.  are you doing that again?
sorry.  you look great.  i'm totally exhausted.
why am i here? what happened?
is she coming back?
not bad. it was slow at first, but i'm doing bits now.
and, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  she can barely get the lines out.  there was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  i know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, joe.  something's gone.  you know, that thing that was sally - that always surprised you.  it's gone.  i think she's scared.  and that's death.
what??
nobody told me.
big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that i don't think is going to make it.
you been okay?
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics? he's just a boyfriend, dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio, i'm about to become single again.  and yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which i'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. you ask me who i choose, i choose you.
judge... we're doing security for betty shabazz's visit next week. i'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. someone like you.

well, that ain't fair to her.  a single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
you're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  i joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
yes, please.

why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? it doesn't make any goddamn sense.
how... how ya doin', farmer?
tone down our headlines? lacy, that's all the common man reads!

barry's mom had this newspaper. it said you killed the guy in minnesota and were in a mental hospital. is it true?
let's go, abdul-shabazz.
good point.
it's amazing how much activity is going on today.
oh, freddie. what could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
please don't be negative, drew, we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud -- the secretary-general of the un, the chairman of the fcc, nine senators, i don't know how many congressmen, and at least twelve of the fortune '500'.
i don't know. i think it's a piano....a small piano.
you're bothered by your performance on the <u>kobayashi maru</u>.
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
i lost a bet.

this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority?
like what?
you can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
well?
how do you do.  my name is penelope ryan.  this is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.
bullshit. e.g. is short for 'ergo'.
where's daddy?

jonathan?
where is he?
where is lt. ilia?
lives are ephemeral. the knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
why didn't you call me?
that's not what i'm sug--
how long have you been living here?
where's luther?
hey. right. no problem. whatever you say, man. you're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. i'm merely here. but obviously i am. here, that is. i hope i'm not talking too much. i don't usually. i think it's all important though, isn't it?
what is it, dad?
not a likeness. it's how you make me feel, alex.
i didn't say a word.
yes ... you know it!  yes ... i will. yeah!
what happened? where's jason?
first off, this mr. chow yen doesn't speak a lot of english. the girl with him will interpret. there will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  i hope you know krugerands better than they know a <u>hockney</u>.
what do you mean?
he is a behemoth.
you don't?
don't let victor push you into making a mistake --
not now, jonah --
oh no.  i smell it.

so they stayed in florida?
i know what you did.
yet another spaghetti night.
hey!!  hey!  how are you doing that? stop that!
go ahead.
the porno mags?
way out of line.
that's a possibility. y'know you boston cops are perking up. that's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
no.
i tried to reach ruth, but we couldn't get her.
okay, here's what i want.  i know about this stuff.  a five-star hotel.  with room service.

but could you try?
...well, it didn't make him happy...
what about bill?
on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
—it started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— who am i kiddin'? they call it a favor but it's do it or else. and this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off joey. i just thought they'd lean on him a little but— last night with edie i wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. i guess i was scared of drivin' her away— and i love her, father. she's the first thing i ever loved.
snoopy?  i love snoopy.
no, no.
no. i mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. he's a very hard worker. very honest. very caring. gentle. good father.
i'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.

was there any evidence that mrs. windham shot him?
you know this is gonna be my first 4th of july picnic in a long time.
dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
a war against the railroad. what the hell were we thinking?
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the tv - but i'm not you know - they are - i don't watch it for entertainment every night - i don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? she was dead - i can't hurt something dead - and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - i couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
but he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
yeah, i'm out.
biscuit, when you're done with jangle leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. it may take a few days, but you're going back.

oh, c'mon. for christsake, do i have to tell you everything?
oh, book?  oh, no, i...  i'm killing time.  i...i-i just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
now, you'll like these. you really "dig" them. they're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
request; life support systems check.
you got a cause of death?
it's gonna be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
if we run into billy first, let me try and talk him in.

i'm sorry.  if there was any other-
brian.
i'm willing to tell you my name.
we're waiting.
how's the new job?
i'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
deal.

what's gonna happen?
you don't have to be involved, will.
gone to ben masters' place.  cow tipping.
it was windthorne. i knew it--what does that do to her love for ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place.  sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns, harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   then mr. stearns, he tried to fix a case.
everything felt right for the first time. i need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. i'm going to speak to dr. feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
make up your mind.
given that, i'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
think about something else.
so... pretty nice house you've got here.
...why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
geez. looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. you call his home?
which means he's having nightmares again?
what?  the curse'll be lifted?  <u>will</u> <u>you please</u>!
so i do it.
but she isn't due for an hour, sir.
i don't want to see you at all!
yes.
this huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, lieutenant.  you'll just scare people off.  i can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  it's state of the art.
that's not bad at all.
it's in an office; i have just left it in the office. 137
well, well.  mrs. brigman.
i threw out the stuff that got broken. the floor looks clean.
clemenza?  no, i don't believe it.

george!
you got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
yes, the police must be called.

yes... isn't it?
would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
ha ha! you said, i do. i guess that means we're married.
i'm sorry. i'm squishing you. i'll move to the...
and beat it at it's own game.
are you crazy?
jon -- i don't have time to play games.  there're leftovers in the fridge.
you're not nothing, erin.
yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  he gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. and they get into one hell of a brawl...
you taking dunbar?
no, i'm not -- i've got some packing to do. i'm also going back to paris today.
your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the irs or the federal prison system.  your mother is barbara, your father is cliff --
he's hardly my mr. dyle.
no. stop in the glade just ahead! when the ladies are rested, we will proceed. do you understand?
a lot of it was. i just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
no goodbyes, elaine.  just go.
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  you're just gonna have to pick me up later.
yes, there is.
we really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, bert?
c’mon.

i'd quit the army for you, if it came to that.
it was a combination of all three.
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
these two fucking scenes are related. too many coincidences. same day? five hours apart? dead mobsters on both scenes. now, why did he kill the bartender?

this is it?  what am i gonna do with this?  holy shit!
have a favour to ask. i want to get out of here.
thanks.
i'm liking this.
lz is two clicks north of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! teams are as follows -- dunbar and nunez, pike and mueller, kendall and childs!
everybody! annie has an announcement --
lee... uh...
well, i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
no!
that is unfortunate. they will have to wait.
there are all sorts of men. you get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
what do you think? you think he's been picking flowers? fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, albert. everybody's ass! even in europe!
only one in the rear, i'm afraid.
who the hell is that?
why wasn't i involved from the beginning?  you and i started fight club together.
well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
this must be beast.
excuse me ... are you talking about recognizing china, mr. president? that would cost us our strongest support.
well done.
and this one, in case you haven't guessed, is junior.
what you saw was a buck wearin' lucy's dress...  i found lucy back there in that canyon...i wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...i thought it best to keep it from you -- long as i could.

then why doesn't she?
honey, about what?
not me.
starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  they -- have intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
and i take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.

i didn't know which side you were on.
this is good.  it is a good story, fish.

exactly.  cukor was too cheap to hire music.  there's nothing but chin-wag.  the cold dreary custard of english chin-wag.
oh, yes you will, ann dear . . . you're very clever.
oh, man --
yes.  yes.  that's exactly it.  yes.
i'll be honest with you.
not an easy book.
i guess so, sir.
what's happening up here?
ok. well, i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago. he was partially frozen for thirty years. i never knew him growing up. he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
sorry, pal.  i'll fix you up, call you a doc, but i ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
mine's new.
well, i'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. you make me sick. you're a hypocrite and i don't associate with hypocrites.
...you didn't close...
you should look like you dressed yourself.
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "applied mathematics and engineering", am i correct?
alot like.  you know, i noticed it before, but i didn't...
well, they needed immediate answers, frances. it's good manners and good sense. you shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.

134  continued:
jack the ripper plays shuffleboard.
how do you know?
i can't! i haven't got it!
no.  for me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, i need know that whoever did this will be punished. if you can find them, i will take their names to the police.  i'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. i'll say i didn't have courage to come forward at first...
yeah?
duke ellington. "things ain't what they used to be", recorded july 30, 1945.

oh good, there's nothing to eat.
the conference is at camp khitomer, near the romulan border. i'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
...maybe we should do a treatment.
look, what i'm trying to say --
john doe.
so the wiretaps we conducted on serna and padiche, the mention of israel's heart?
i don't understand.  aren't you frightened?
would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
so you knew this when you wrote your report?
look...i'm getting a bad feeling up here...i'd like you to do something for me.  look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...i've been a jerk. when things panned out for her, i should've been behind her all the way ...we had something great going until i screwed it up...she was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  she's heard me say i love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...i'm sorry.  you get all that?
somebody couldn't wait until dark.
well call them up and explain it to 'em, walter!  your plan is so fucking simple, i'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  that's the beauty of it walter!
-- even if i give you a million as well?
what she did not say was, 'i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' all she cared about was that look. all she remembered was that look. and why do we remember things in movies? because we can see them.
well, how come i laid nine?
...gruber's not bad.
that's all?
like i always do?
honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. they'll say the strangest things.
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
you see, in america they care for work, they live to work.  but in italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
take the dope, too.
okay, okay...
please!  i'll never let you down again, mother.  never.  i promise.
i thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
which hospital?
have we met?
i know.
the owlship.  i can't believe it.
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, lieutenant?
sorry.
fine work, jon.

they've closed the set. they sent everybody home.
mimi!

on course, admiral. estimating spacedock in two point one hours.
i'm going back.
b-b-books.  you... you killed five men... singlehanded.
captain, there are five borg ships closing in on our position.
that's it.
say, hildy, if i know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. are you trying to scoop us or something?
why not?
but what?
yeah!
you're out of your league, marylin. rexroth was a primate. i'm a professional.
yeah vick?
just what i said. don't look so scared.
no bones?
alright, you got it. and i'll be putting an observer in with you.
she's going to divorce me.
she can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
it was full of this awful pink ooze.
who tied her down?  you or him?
sure.
it's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  i had a father like that.
i... he had my wrists pinned behind me. i remember my hands were cold.'
whoa, i have serious space issues, dude. what do you want?
two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
so...
what are you saying?
i'm hungry.  go kill me some dinner.
okay. come on in. looks like you had a bad face lift.
bull.
god, you scared me.
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
who?
really, sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
i'm very sorry, jimmy.  i apologize to you.
not in front of the boy.
where do you think?  i stole him.
vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, yakavetta's right hand. he's the one who set me up. then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone i was as good as dead. he goes in there every wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. never misses.
what happened?
he's dead.
you sound like the media.
i'm a little scared of storms. always have been. since i was a kid.
it's lovely.
-- good afternoon --
m'sieu laval, there are several things i've wanted to ask you for quite a while. i understand you are from marseilles.
t-tell him that?
free!
your mother all right?
i won't say anything. honest, i won't.
did you pick it up from the street?
mmm.  a lawyer, huh?  too bad.  but at least you're surfing now.  so your life's not over yet, right?
no, i got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
are you sure it's all right?
it may sound like music to her -- i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower.  click — click — click.
no, thank god... just missed him.
great. how old are they?
at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. you said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with cherry seven-up.
you think?
shut up!  i hate them polish jokes!
good, and according to your questionnaire, helmuth, you never joined the nazi party.
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
what the hell's going on?
it wouldn't hurt. you can't go on living in fantasies. did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? and drop it?  why, our strategic defense boys would have  --
and, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
thank you, mrs. rand.  i think you're every bit as nice as wes says you are.
yeah, right.  don't push your luck. anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
say, take it easy! take it easy! listen, my boy. no use you hanging around here. just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it. you can rewrite it for your last edition.
you'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  sit on the cot.  keep this pointed at him if i get preoccupied.
open this door!
exactly. i don't know what i'd do without you.
send them home. we are not the police. what do we have to protect them?
i get it--lee lother have a hand in that, too?
i used to live in this house.
shut up!
perhaps we could both go at the same time...
at first, i thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  teddy was furious when he found out i'd taken tranquilizers!
tony....tony....
demons, jake? come on. they're winos and bag ladies. low life. that's all they are. the streets are crawling with 'em. don't make em into somethin' they're not.  it's the pressure, honey. that's all it is.
the enemy is matching velocity.
rusty's dead. that's ajax
not <u>a building</u>!  that's the beauty of it.  i think i can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  these people don't know the value of their property!
what -- you don't have the medallion?
i swear to god... on my salary, i'm not gonna be any hero...
yeah.
you go naked.  something about the field generated by a living organism.  nothing dead will go.
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park...?
you called me to ask me how to get laid?
worker!  come back here now!
somebody had to say it. i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
maybe. but i'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
i'm sorry for all the trouble... thank you.
then it's war?
good. more coffee?  robert, i hope you don't mind my asking, but i feel like i should.
i really hate to bother him, but...
fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. how long can a battle go on?
mac?  oh there you are.  what are you doing, honey?  no more work.  don't you feel breezy.
czar for life, just like a real czar.
can't i come, too?
god damn it you two! run! hurry! he's dead!
they don't arrest people for having feelings.
please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
why would i want to go there?
i'll... take your word for it. so who are you, then?
i don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...i don't know why i just did.
they dinna fire on themselves. and there were no other ships present.
you're not taking me seriously.
passing 8. passing 6. lock your harness!
she saved your life, parker. she didn't have to, but she did.
...i am at home with the me. i am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
yeah.  i follow you.
uh-huh.

how'd you know about that?
let's hope they like it there.

the goods.  the sound.  the sale.  let's rearrange a few things.  mary patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  get over here.  mary robert --with the sopranos.
once in a while, steamed dumplings.  but only when she was drunk.
how have you liked your stay?
i never was no good with history.
he's just raffish. harry put him up to it. before evening sun sets, i would have his belongings back on route 55, that old fox.
we thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
turk, what are you doing here?
will you use the troops?
oh, it's very difficult. you know harry...we didn't do...
you're such an asshole.
no, i asked you to give me a refreshing drink. i wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
if they're going to poke fun at me, i'm going to—
yup. you still got the spencer rifle?
okay, chewie, it's now or never.
what's happened?
they let you out?
tommy!
what do you mean?
huey man i got to talk with you...
tell them to go away. i don't want to see anybody.
in heaven, perhaps. it is not a comedy i am writing now. a broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
what's the matter with you? do i look gay to you?
he won't listen to anybody.  he's been very crazy all summer.  since june he's been trying to kill me.
trust me, violet.
that's all right.  there is nothing anyone can do about it.  you can call me luke.
<i>that's my best friend. his name is choco. he's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
-- and they're sure it's him? --
new mecca....
oh, "dr. acula."  i get it.  i don't like it.
who's it for? a relative?
i have come to claim what is mine, father.
no. i think his widow's still in their place in darktown, though.  you think it's charley wade, huh?
why do i have to sleep with donnie? he stinks.
i say ya nothin'!
water on arrakis!!! i have seen this place in a dream.  a treasure.
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
that is so gentlemanly of you.
okay. "dance music for old people?"
all right, all right... it'll be okay.  i mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
hal?
uncle al, what if it's not a guy?
who?
not much story here. just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
'then how do you account for me?,
i'll probably marry him.
i thought so. where's your husband?
oh, yeah?
okay, okay. look, sylvia -- instead of friday - could we make it thursday night?
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
her doctors killed her.
jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
jimmy?
that's not enough.
that wraps it up -- tex has the money. go back to bed -- i'll let you know when i've found him.
yeah.
haven't we met before?
we got 'em!
all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  what's a person worth to you.
don't do it, ted. don't do it.
klingons... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia!! they seem to be more than just images...
in my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
she's protecting the doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
someone missed you.
short enough. but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name.
and we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
we run they'll shoot us anyway.  if we keep driving they might think we friendlies; iraqis.  or even if they know we're americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
yeah?
i want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  i don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
you know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
what kind of test?
of course not.
you're more than that, luther.  they were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  they want you back in.
would you like some coffee?
and, i'll tell you what, mr. dugan, i've been insulted grossly in this house.  i ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. i'm an englishman, i am, and a man of property; and i -- i --
let us walk.  from what i understand, diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
z...if we don't make it...i just want you to know....
what's this guy's problem?
the child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
oh... wow!  sonny, you're really into one mess now.
what about the confession?
juice?
i, i was asked to do this material - -
i got you covered.
oh, i'm only exploring your theory. let's take a step further. you drink, don't you, charlie?
how does he know so much about me?
what is it?  a military spacecraft? like a shuttle or satellite?
yes, general kutusov, i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  another lesser possibility might be to march on st. petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
uh, listen -- willie -- i got a better idea.
on december 2, 1804, napoleon was made emperor of france.  he would later say:  "i found the crown lying in the gutter and i picked it up."
the envelope -- imagine that.  mrs. lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. go to the embassy right away -- wait, i'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the palais royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. hurry, mrs. lampert.
i was doing my job. at the risk of sounding egotistical, i didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. i was chasing tail all night--i was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "brock leviathan, architect."  i can't believe he ordered white wine.  you do know white wine is not real wine...
blasphemy be damned! waldman spent his life trying to help people!
i know about what you mean!
but i have to leave tomorrow. the forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
that's how congress--or any large body--is run. all work has to be done by committee.
man, you really bummed me out. that's a terrible story.  nigger, you crying?
that bad, huh?
you guys having fun?
what, aliens?
what's so funny?
&lt;&lt;it is longer than that. and not so dark. &gt;&gt;
mr. malkovich, my name is craig schwartz. i can explain. we operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
could we have a word?
what if i told frank that you opened me?
michael! come inside!
yes?
take care, you hear?
michelle cannot possibly accept!
need to lose myself awhile.
there's no one here.
there's never any
fifteen percent skim?
that's enough.
i'm afraid not.  but you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  just another american who saw too many movies as a child.  another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's john wayne...rambo... marshal dillion.
no kung pao chicken.  never.
jake.
and the blood let you out?
if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here.
look, about the layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the buttle family.
hello, natalie, you recognize the voice? i'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
i did?
c'mon, forsythe. are there any more on the list?
what reason?
how do you know that?
you are.
i didn't give you cancer, laurie.  not you, not the others.  i don't know what did.
what do you think would be in order?
i need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
i didn't mean nothin' by it.
yes, i am.
you mean that?
gabby, what is it?
nick, listen.  from clyde wynant!  "will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder. communicate with herbert macaulay".
no -- we're from strange facts and mysteries.  it's a syndicated show out of..
bet you're only eight and a half.
oswald and ghosts.
you remember what happened next?
wet your eyes, boy.  stay in there for about 20 minutes.
what owners, harold? we don't <u>own</u> anything. it's a transitory world. we come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
the tower, yes -- flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
what about that other guy?
what?
freud, do you know...?  freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon.
have you completely lost your mind? so you get her out of here. so you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like french vanilla ice-cream?
i haven't had my breakfast.
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, alice...
no. i want to know why you're here in berkeley?
some classy tub in it's day, huh?
you have chills?
what are you doing here?
allison is sick in bed.  i have to go over there, honey.
red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? a squid?
yeah.
now wait a minute, wait a minute...
darling.
-- then you don't wish to call any witnesses, mr. dowd?
fifty-seven...oh, christ...
he just lost his best client.  he called from the plane.  i invited the guy over.
don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   we're talking about love, okay?  let's be rational.
hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. and lead us not into temptation.
rufus, play it back...
cut it out, pa. he'p al with the truck.  don't fret, honey. you goin' to be awright.
they didn't get your contract.  i filed it before i left.
what makes you so sure?
typical male.
be nasty.
whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, gene?
they have noble faces.
you're going to get it. you know what happens.
sugar?
you shouldn't tell me that now. after all these years!  i put all your things in here. go in, go in...
ray is director of all european sales and services for american ex...  but i'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...i was at the lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
cole, it'll be all right. honey?
three white males shot junior.  mike followed them to york estates --
thanks for coming back for me.
no.
is mom ever coming back?
was it -- swine?
i bet.  a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
now that wasn't a friendly thing i heard, toddy.  not at all friendly.
you know what i think?
six. got it.
you're going to burn up in those.
a father is nothing but sperm, ted. it takes a real man to be a dad.
so, what kind of gig is this?
that makes no difference. all men are equal in god's eyes.
i knew you were lying.
i am calm.
hi gummy. how’s the eye?
it's him.
and much richer as a result.
do you know who put it there?
what is it?
he'll find us, won't he?
nobody can figure it out. and the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
yeah, it's your father's.
i can't handle it. i can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... tell me!
i can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
icey, i'm worried about willa.
she doesn't have anything to do with it!  you understand that? mother?  this is me!
ever wondered why jenny greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
just sugar then.  you and john ever come here?
it's just that my movie is so-
i can feel air.
how does she know?
he saw the accident...?
save your breath, ms. thompson.  dr. simms gave me specific instructions. nobody gets to see kristen -- especially you.  she made that real clear.
martin, it could be anything.
ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? i could start to --
no, that's not what i mean.  i mean -- look.  you know what made me leave that game?  coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
spencer's doing fine. so what are you saying, that you're frustr...
well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
uncle alfred?
how can we help him.
dear duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely... i wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. do you see?
i'm only safe in the russian zone... i'm safe as long as they can use me...
i'll hurry back.
i guess you think that i talked you into something, huh? 
such a bargain. but that is your decision?
-- but, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. yet they forced themselves to be positive.  they never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  they always talked about getting better.
that doesn't prove a thing -- wait until i get a court order for a blood test.
yo, chill man, i'm talking to venezuela.
i'm not "people." i'm just me. and i do whatever i goddamn want to do. got it?
no.  he was my brother.  he died at anothers hand.
when does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
watch out for that glass.
won't we? right? am i right?
well, you're perfect now.
gabriel, you promised!
it's what?
'but keep dancing, and if you're lucky, i might just never leave, who knows?'
hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
he's got her up in the room, under guard.  and he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  so buddy... i say we work a trade.
... that is a very small room.
he feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
why don't you come with us.
for somebody else, alright?  not for me. i don't do that shit anymore.
he is. take my word for it.
hi. nice to see you.
sorry man...
why don't you go and chase yourself?
yeah. you didn't wanna take me to the prom.
hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, i'm getting all excited.  so what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'executive committee' or could you guys use me?
seventy-one
whew! that wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
i don't believe a thing she just said.
how 'bout a real drink?
where to?
and you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
what else did you see- michael...?
what are you doing?
that's how i ruined my stomach.
it was never pentangeli... i've always known that.  it was roth all along.  he talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
not for lack of love, i can tell ya that.
what... ?
