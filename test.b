janet.
it's the fall of the roman empire, are you blind?  and we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
just saying it's not hard to end a life.
jimmy grantz. know him?
i can't make the tenth.
you know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, user said to go take that sucker out. an' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. i feel like hittin' him now, while i'm good an' mad. some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
if he tricked me into loving him, is what i meant.
well, how about a walk, charlie bell..
yeah. puff and i got into a big, philosophical discussion. he's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. he's going to make us famous, lila.
god, i don't think so. better look in the house.
snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  i'm sorry, lee, you never had a chance.
okay, mom. you coming later? you coming later, george?
i never hear the whistle.
jeremy listen to what--
he doesn't. i don't know what he has, but i'm hoping to god it's not infectious...
don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
something happened to him?
the knife.  what knife?
oh, they seem all right to me.
i'll make this as simple as i can, george. they disappeared.
one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. name's carl taylor. long record of arson, assault, the works. the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia... still waiting for interpol.
you will be contacted with the assignment.
listen, father! "young lochinvar smitten with susan paine"!
but what can we do?  she don't know who's visiting her ...
what?! you're calling me a stalker?
go to bed.
oh shit it's my cell!
sorry, max.  a die for a die.
motherfuck a window, radio raheem is dead.
half a flounder. hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
what are you trying to do?  make bert look like a fool?  he's made all the arrangements.
look at this!  the dog!  she's dead!
that's right.
well, no place where they speak english.  that way he can always say he was misquoted.
i copy.
no, i don't.
oh - i'll get it!
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
is it like eichmann? are we goofing?
-- yeah, honey...
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
shut up.' just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
look, that's temporary, believe me. there's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won't matter a bit.
you heard right.
she'll say, "now my son is a man."
i'm very sorry.
there must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
who—me?  want to see me?
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
how would the "enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with benton, pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
perk.
she says she's on the rag every time i get called in to investigate a murder.
business was fine.  i'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
mom, is there any coffee left?
lobotomy bay?
well, i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me.  some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
you promised you would get me to my ship.
take a look.
you hit a bad streak.  we've all... look at this: fifteen units mountain view, the fucking things get stole.
even the fall from the plane?
that's right.
forget it, quentin.  it can happen to the best of us.  now let's get squared away.
and be crushed.
is this a joke?  did baxter put you up to this?
yeah.  i can tell.  victor was right.
and where are they now?
a lot of tv. i was a regular on a couple of series. and lately i've been doing a lot of commercials. national mostly.
no shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
are you watching a porno movie?
shouldn't take it personally.
you're joking, right?  what are you doing? un-fucking- believeable. can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
why, lois, i didn't know . . . who is he?
you didn't tell her?
at the party.
hey, fuckball, i don't need your permission. l.a.'s an open city.
how would he avoid it... as if i needed to ask?
you been followin' the news coverage?
that's so cool.
yeah, yeah--go home.
i'll see you back at the hotel.
you must take your own life now, david, before it's too late.
listen, kelly skipped school.  have you talked to her?
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
whose side are you arguing ...?  i thought that you wanted to do something.  i don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- no offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... i have an interest in the hospital;  and i don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  they gave her the wrong anesthetic.  they turned the girl into a vegetable. they killed her and they killed her kid.  you caught 'em.  now: how many others did they kill?
yeah?
what about your stint in korea? i'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
but maybe you can change all that.
yes. infinitely more. they would become as god.
and i had to widen a few doors. you'll see.
thirty.  name your price.  everyone has a price, what's yours?
do you know how long all this will last? not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. ages will roll... ages. and you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
mom, we already...
not his style.
how do you mean, start?
i'm going to be living with my brother. he's not in such good shape as i am, but... i'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
it doesn't neccessarily matter. they don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
what the hell?
no, i don't think so.  you just have to...pray, or reach...
you go back, i'll walk.
fire!
checking in...karla wilson.
see, ya.
i called your room from downstairs.
who's gonna to that?  japan is four thousand miles away.  so you guys just arrived, huh?
you're duty to what? the country you served doesn't exist anymore.
i'm being realistic.  look, i have a spiritual side.  i mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  that should count for something.
what else?
he hit his head.  on the way in.
you don't know to a certainty. twenty minutes it could be here.
i've chickened out. i'm afraid of him. he'll like that.
yeah.  jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski.
sure!  comedy!  make jokes about the traffic.  do impressions.  maybe a little blue material...
but you can breathe it.
a martian is from mars, trevor.
how long you here, joe?
how should i know?
do i? do i?  for all you know i'm just "crewman #6"!  okay, it's fleegman! guy fleegman! there! now i'm a whole person! i can't die! fleegman! they can't kill me now, can they? can they?
who?
thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
no reason. it's only, i just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
it's about time.
thanks.  for everything.
it reminds me very much of this one. nicht wahr?
i'm not hungry, really.
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies?  it hits all of a sudden and below there's california and you swear you're looking at heaven.
why?  we're only talking.
anyone else having breathing problems? aside from me?
it's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  we were completely unprepared.
i don't follow baseball.
no...
you watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... you don't think i see what's going on? del, now this cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with joyce... 's not no conspiracy, not some episode off the x-files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
a thousand? she's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
this is our first "date" date.
yes.
jesus fucking christ, diego.  i ain't telling you.  it's just business.  now, shut up.  you're driving me crazy.
i used to.
you said it again!
fully.  i like her.  she has wit.
this better be good
what are you going to do with my day tomorrow, m'sieu laval?
i'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. i want to see where he goes.
no -- she left me!  after her miscarriage, i --
did he say if she was shooting at him?
you were in love with him, weren't you?
i'll have a talk with her. by the way, you never said anything about last night ...
yeah!  <u>lugosi</u>!
shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over. there was a soil sample.  non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  so i became a wax expert.  there's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
sounds like he wanted to get caught.
is it about a pirate's daughter?
i can't let you do this...
for a little while.
there is, but it's not that interesting.
i guess not, bob. i don't like guns around.
he was taking something out of the apartment. i'm certain.
t.j., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
nick tatopoulos.
i heard.  who the hell let them up there?
yes.  some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
of course, it's madison!!! who else could it be?
father adelfio, i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. and you've got to help me, because i've lost all peace of mind...
he was quoting the bible, revelations: "behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him."
he doesn't bite.
tommy, what happened?
davis. i'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. but come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that i couldn't fully appreciate it. i wasn't fooled for a second. now, if you'd said price, or mcdermott...otherwise, it was amusing. now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. hilarious, davis. a killer.
that's what i like about you, lupus. you're a free thinker. don't let the king tell you different.
she's okay.
yeah?
bummer.
the words?
i really should get home...
fine —— you want to stay here?
hi.
two hundred dollars. it was my last two hundred.
franco harris has a flare for the dramatic. the former pittsburgh steeler running back, beat known for "the immaculate reception," his improbable sixty yard ricochet reception. i say ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate america.  harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the park sausage company. by taking on the challenge of resurrecting park's, harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
i feel like i'm entering a forbidden tomb...
good thing you are beautiful, kid. you are <u>dumb</u>!
how ya doin', al?
boy, if we were inside, i know how to forge us a group 6 access...
shut your mouth!
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
eh, there's only three of them.
ah, my roots here are too deep. i love my practice, the people i work with, warren's got a nice thing going  why don't you just move down here and marry me?
and what do you burn, apart from witches?
sssshhh. on screen the phone rings. the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. she grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
he said he's in charge...
you know exactly where they are!
yes sir!
yeah.
it's really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he's peaceful...
but, you know, so what?
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
i'm still not clear on chaos.
college nickname.
oh, i see. cats' fur.
you think this is funny, carter?  you send for someone from explosives!? four men just died in there!
hi.
you ain't actin', mama.
captain jack sparrow.  if you please.
can we go somewhere and talk?
she can't get a job, it's a depression. and we can't just throw her out on the street.
car clean? plenty of gas?
what do you need? a telephone, some broad to say "good morning," nothing...nothing...
it's just that -- well, i'm honored that you selected me, and everything, i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
there you are, boss, just like you ordered. symbols of the little people.
i just need to lie down for awhile
what happens at eleven o'clock?
i just played it.
nothing. don't worry... i promise i'll get a job next week.
hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  are you nuts? if anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  the judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
if only alex and i had done that with the others, alex might still be...
don't panic.
yeah.
oh... alright, back you go.
thanks.
too bad it didn't happen to miser stevens.
you're just doing your job.
maybe i want to feel badly.
what are you thinking? are you angry with me?
yes, he is different... not the kind of person one usually meets in washington.
are you okay?
mr. treves, there is something i've been meaning to ask you for some time...
you'll be at the docks ... keeping otto abreast of our progress ...
oh, i'm sorry, gus! my foot must have slipped.
this ain't no cop.
wait. what do i do?
naw'sir... i gotta be on my way.
what's your name?
hey, i tried to get her off the phone.
what? for chrissakes, spit it out.
just fine.
the case!
where's ned?
why're you driving so fast?
get out of here.
her brother.
and that's the point, that we all have stories. the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. it's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? don't call it new theater, charlie; call it real theater. call it our theater.
me?  i'm a little of everything.  some irish, some german, some french, dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  and that's what made this country great.
as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.
rocky!  the ramp!
we should have. let me see.
mr nedry, mr nedry.  the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then.
i didn't intend to sleep all night! i just pulled over... have i broken any laws?
did you do that to him?
the feds would be onto you in a month.
i did. he said he had work to do until late.
no. you’re fired! get out of my house. and take your sick tape with you...
exactly.
i don't know that they 'pinched' it. don't even know that they're blokes.
herman.
long, boring, and generally pretty sad. arnie seemed to enjoy it...  hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
potential toxic dump site.
yeah. i think so. i just had to tell him some of what i knew. is friday still on?
i saw the iceberg, mr. andrews. and i see it in your eyes. please tell me the truth.
she's only known the guy a few months.
a-okay.  got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  i'm ready for action.
uh, huh huh. is that gonna be enough time?
it ain't so bad, 'cause i was a nothin' before --
speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
that you come with me.
listen, jesse, we've got a problem.  it's cole.
your family just met me.
just show the sword.
i don't know ...  maybe because you've never needed my help.
more than that actually, when you think about it.  you know, meatloaf has a very nice pair...
shit and fried eggs.
maybe it had something to do.
i am.
agnes...
that actually goes on...
dr. hirsch?
me?  sure i do.
only two things come out of oklahoma, steers and queers. which one are you, boy? i don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
then don't complain.
hey jeff. i'm feelin' so much better.
before i forget.  put it on the bookshelf.
he's trapper john! only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a boston and maine railroad car! when the conductor caught him in there with his winter carnival date, she screamed: 'he trapped me!' what have you been doing since those days, trapper?
where's my father?
the american theater doesn't need people like that.
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
it must be the girls. one of the girls.
the russian would be easier.
look, kathryn.  they're jealous.
mr. sheldrake? oh, yes. very.
think she might've run out on you?
you just havin' a fit. you ain't goin' nowhere.
jessica. are you sure?
m-o-n-y -- i'm right! that's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. m-o-n-y.
to a man called frank cotton?
have i slept long?
that's the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house. she seems like a nice girl. i think he has a feeling for this girl. you heard him sing. he been singing like that all morning.
what for?
you was in the marines, huh?
come on, shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
i put them on together.
i have her in creative writing and she's fairly nice.
no -- madam grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
meaning?
no way. i've been waitin' for this asshole.
how 'bout another cup of coffee?
that's just what you would say.  this is so unreal.  i'm dreaming...
where are you going?
because i don't love him.
yeah, i, we both live downtown.
yes.
uh huh...
a thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. what we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
unlock one of the other storage rooms.  we're going upstairs.  we'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
fuck you.
my god, i heard something!
railroad burned him out too. you couldn't have stopped him.
the plastique i found.  is the building on fire?
it's my house.
come, come, sir.  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
that man is your father?!?
i'm afraid it is dr. johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
oh. tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
how much? okay. make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. bye.
no, i wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. winningly. maxwell now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
i did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
really?  okay!
not luck. they don't want me.
that's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  don't be offended, lad.  a man who's got no ethics is a free man.  i envy you that.  beside, i can hardly blame you.  that grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? eh?
that was cool, wasn't it? you know, i don't even know where that came from. i just opened my mouth and it came out. after i said it i thought, that's a cool line, i gotta remember that.
yeah, but i'm buying.
maybe. i don't know. he has not asked my advice. if he asks my advice, i don't know what i will say.
i told you, i knew your sister.
me? no, no. i-i couldn't make it that ni- my-my raccoon had hepatitis.
who'll i aim at?
what plates?
no...i’m not...
here?
really?
"madam!"
fifty's a nice round number.
don't cause a scene. no one's trying to win any 'rounds'. don't make it any worse.
i need a favor.
how about i put nikko on it?
kill a dead guy?
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. that you wanted to go back.
i don't follow...
found what?
possibly.  please just wait outside.
oh.  but, if you please -- what are munchkins?
you're --
yeah.
really?
she called the consumer...the attorney, i don't know.  the attorney gen...they said we have three days...
yup.  they must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
- type o.
this isn't right.
what alien environment?
twelve.
she ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
do you still want the operation?
why?  you going to give me hard time like the others?
so much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? i remember when you weren't saved. that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road.
but sean said...
oh, i'm sorry --
oh, god, dion.
look, mom, i think i've found the dress.
hi, darling.
the shark.

i feel really on the spot now.
you are the son of king uther, and the fair igrayne... you are king arthur.
this must have cost a fortune.
he was born fighting. and born hungry.
i don't know. wherever you want.
crop duster.
you'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
his word.
no. listen to me...the kid, eugene...
i asked you a direct question!  a glimpse of what?!

yeah, yeah.  she called a cab. said something about catching a plane.
is that what you want?
good.
i think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
you want me to write down all your messages?
i ain't got the money.
you've got to get yourself out of that place. they're going to kill you if you don't.
yeah, maybe.
i can't understand that.
do you have visual?
of course you took the initiative.
who with?
not me. it would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
that's it. just the two rooms.
yeah?
omar, your wife's here.  ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  but i gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  if you haven't, i'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
wait!!  where are you?
we really should get together sometime soon... i-i'll definitely call you this week --
would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  did you notify the parents?
when's that, a week?  two weeks?...  we have to figure out a plan of action now.
what's the bad news?
will i ever be normal?
and what's that mean?
you said ... one shot.
what it is?  what it will be, muthafucka.
and you should know, if i remember rightly.

holy shit, i don't know.
perhaps you think no man would return to me.
there are three men dead.
no.
come up here a minute.
ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
they're like pink snow, sir.  sticky.
"fucked me."
see, i...
any id on the shooter yet?
got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. except you gotta do it right. i mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. you could be there all fuckin' night.
i haven’t thought about that in years.
uh-uh. that's a spook house.
i'm trying.  shit.  here -- catch her.
i don't watch him eat everyday.

that would be lieutenant garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
i'm an editor. i know what ought to be written, but i can't write it the way you could. it needs a woman's heart --
don't talk about elaine.
maybe.  what's this about?
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
i don't care who you are ...  i just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction. in 45 minutes.

i won't <u>make</u> it to the police. they won't let me get there. you go.
i hate this.
maybe lead to a flare up...
when i was a young man we used to recite cato... we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... purity of heart.  i was drunk on something then...
i just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
if you will order stuff that comes from kat-man-fucking-du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ never mind that, what about the money?
it gets worse there. leavin' me to my own mind. that's just not good.
thanks for the consultation....
what's that?
you told me.
yes sir.
how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can't he right, can it?
not with me.  not with people.
what do you mean?
or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
but i can't just drop everything and leave.  i have responsibilities and obligations.
no.  no.  he didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
time.
you think i manifested the snakes?
i don't wanna kill anybody. but if i gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
one thing led to another. he was my husband once.
we can't leave without you!
i'm the one what?
what for?
just loud enough to wake me up.
oz.
two people do.  orson welles and me.
now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. i can stall if it's more, but i need time to find a good window, alright?
meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route.
honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
the point being that him, the networks don't want black people on television unless they are buffoons.
billy! i'm gettin' a vision!  you're the next one...
all right, all right.  jesse james never yelled at folk...
i'm sorry i couldn't come up with something more positive.
george, darling! where have you been?
yes?
like a baby. you?
he said not to tell.
did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
that's pretty close. he's going to be on the bill. why not put barbara jean on with him?
it's a bet--come on, sally!
you are half human. the computer knows that.
aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
forward!  forward!  now reverse!
well almost.  depends which house.  it smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
michael, the sub's dead.
i'll get it because i'm a good actress, richard.
you're nuts.
... it is much better down there. it's a better place.
well, that figures.  kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
oh... how quickly they grow up.  hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
i don't know.
save it, honey.  we want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up mr. zukerman's phone bill.
of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. i'm telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.
i not only say it, i'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
sure.
i know - i'11 take it in to george tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  stupid thing.
yes.
just try and chill a little bit, alright.
i have no idea...
a good deal, like this with us, for burnett will be good only temporarily.  he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  life is dust, make it while you can.  he's ambitious.
i'm alright, gibby.
hal phillip walker.
that's a lot of cash. he came up with it pretty quick.
oh. hi.
you know, i almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  i said that to leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
stop.
jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  if you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
excellency, you are right.
i'm sorry... i don't know how to ask the questions.
and you know why? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. what's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
what the fuck are you... ?
when mankind comes to its senses. we will return.
are you serious?
please.  it's for your own good.
bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
i'm sorry.  i'm just here to shower.
i molested little girls.
it's very bad this.  terrible sad. such a young man.
i took a loan on my car and my computer.
careful, it's slippery.  i had it waxed.
gangway, turkies!
maybe we should knock first?
i mean, you could have killed yourself.
oh, i... have those too.  what kind of problems does your dad have?
deep shit?
well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
the little man in my...  ...head...
oh my god! adrienne?
she asked me what i was thinking about? what should i have done? lie?
well, that's all that wrestling is. except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. well, it's your first time. and you're out of your weight class.
who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
they're yours.  take them.
no, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
yes?
can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
yes?
okay.
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as i say.
i quite agree.  tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
playing?
that’s easy. you’ve seen my car.
maybe when they call i'll just tell ellie i haven't seen the damn cat around. you know?
i've got things to do.
when can i have one?
you don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
but mr. richards and mr. sampson-
absolutely.
doing what i did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. it takes it's toll. it took nine moons to get back my strength.
trust me donut.  i know.
yeah.  i want to tell you everything.
i don't want to lie down. i've been lying down enough.
and you had a sister who died in the convent.
i think it's coming now...
you didn't volunteer, jackson.
alright. a month. in a month.
i know.  it sucks.  i suck.
mmm...
okay, get your clothes on. i got the cab downstairs.
--and that squeaker the aggies dropped to oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
and judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
hey.
me, too... day and night-cycle.
then what?
poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
boss, we got our own tradition. we call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
really? and how are you, eh?  someone called pierre dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a brazilian friend of...
i know, i know ...!
what for, dickweed?
you know what i mean...
who do i play?
can't.
it's because i didn't come in. i live in the hut, now. i meant to tell you..see ya.
this your place?
yeah.
goddamn it stephen!
when your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... ignore him.
in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection.  we gotta better ourselves."  you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>?
no, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. i'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat padiche, the man contacting me... right now, what we got --  -- is a number and a name... buddy israel.
i don't think.  i know.  he looks at me like i'm the ugliest thing in the world.  he doesn't like my friends--he--
okay.  and let's have the car right outside.
ahhhhhhh!
you never were a team player. that's why you never had any friends.
that's now.  in an hour, he could have total recall.
i'm here, harry.
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge. i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people.
what the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  don't you see what he's doing!  he's hijacking the shipment!
stuffed and baking.
sobering...
it's mine all right. i've owned that little sucker for a long time.
if there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
they just sort of leave me cold.
you're saying "me."
you're gonna shoot me!
i'm not. i was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. i believed you, i thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. i helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. the guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * we found him and you killed him.				  *   memento - green revisions 10-4-99 115a.
sit down for a second.
right down to my socks, turkey.  if i'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, i wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
me?  i say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
and i don't need to know. so fuck you, i'm goin' to hollywood.
you're right.  let the men decide.
pumps stop pumping oil. pipe lines stop pipin' oil. tankers stop deliverin' oil. man, this is high stakes.
jeffrey.
i thought you were watching him.
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
so if i get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. you know-'cause they're always laughin'.
and who the hell is that?
you don't know the how, mr. vesci. and that's not the half of it.  i've got your money, and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
i want it back.
christ.  i didn't lock the fucking drawer!  you spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  you can't imagine how many times i saw you two... your head together, i wish him dead.  every time... want to hear something weird?  i feel like i'd give my life to bring him back.
he used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
alright. i will not come. provided one thing.
you must make the time.  where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
frankly that's how i remember it.
what about you?!
you're full of yourself.  what are you doing?
i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
then, we fight --
...we'll gettim in their cars.
fact it rach, you are desperate.  your just going to go in and buy a costume for jamie. perfectly legit.
do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing mecca?
no, i don't feel so good. we're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
shut up.  i'm having a rhetorical conversation.  how humiliating.  max bialystock. max bialystock.
i'll send them right up.
i've always been good.  ever since i started.  gave up piano.  easy money. i'm putting a stake together, get something started.  go figure it all out...
what'cha got, bennett?
well, you know i'm standin' here and you say i look good?
shh.  shhh....
i remember you.
well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
what's that one, there?
correct, and that's when --
yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. why?
who says i'm the one that called it off?
aw, loosen up, bowman...  hey, willie, i got one served up for you.
i don't have your number, stop by the shop.
bill didn't say - but lloyd was beside himself. he listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
here in buenos aires.
you will?  excellent, alright, this is great.  you will, really?
why she got a chain on her?
yes... well, good day, mr. merrick.
it's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
five thousand dollars.
no.
i'll act surprised.
hey, you're not alone.  we have to stop him, i'm with you.
never!  i'm going in and ask him—
on your six -- coming hard. four hundred. losing airspeed! he's on your six and closing fast! hard left! hard left!
comes night we'll get outa here.
it's just up ahead.
well what would you know about it? you don't have anything to lose.
probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  a black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  with this kid, the possibilities are endless.
have ya been to the celebrity room before? with other, uh, clients?
may god protect you.
why?  because she would never show up at something like this.  she's intensely private.
'cause when we bought the house it was autumn. this is summer. feed the dogs.
shhhhh... it's four o'clock... that woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
i'm sorry.
unless he was involved with grunemann's disappearance.
that is both impudent and untrue... tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our billy's latest effort?  or should i say, his "next-to-latest"?
get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
honestly! you cut me to the core! what's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when i finally succumb -- when at long last, i pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? have you no faith in your own medicine?
why ain't they more like it?
i'm just the greeter -- and in that capacity, i now urge you all strongly to --
you keep out of this. bruce, suppose you examine mr. burns in his office. i'll get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building. you phone me as soon as mr. burns has given you his check. then i'll go get the interview and you phone mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  and no tricks, walter!
you know what paris is saying about the countess falconier and her chauffeur?
i want to come in.
so this is what, a test?
no.
i'd like that very much.
you don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
looks like, unless tokyo lets me start.
i love you...
what's your point, wes?  you have a point?
with all due respect, sir, i think it's the best work i've done.
they'll kill you, you know they will. besides, there is no back door. keep smiling. ready? now.
okay.  i understand.  i'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
six, eight hours tops.
that's not an answer.  what is it you want?
it's all wonderfully under control, samuel- you've done a splendid job.
it'll be a first class-ticket. i'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. i would recommend staying down there at least a year, mr. nugent.
you  make me nervous.  anyway if i can pick your brain --
so, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
drugs?  cash?  both if we're lucky.
they all get the wrong idea.
what about newspapers and magazines?
you did say it, sir.
not yet.
if we are clean gollie will take us over at nogales. if we are hot we'll have to try laughlin at el paso.
no, linda, you don't understan --
where the hell is she?
parents still together?
i'm okay.
is it a good room?
good heavens no. that'd create the very worst impression. you must be optimistic. you must convince them. you know as well as i do that the merger must go through.
how did i get in this taxi?!
this is a nuisance suit.  he's looking for small change.  he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
so that's the way it is?
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
how do we do that?
don't.  it was a shitty job anyway. i overreacted.
so we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
that's the god's truth.  and it gets me depressed.  i swear that it does.  at my age.  to see a goddamn: "somebody wins the cadillac this month.  p.s. two guys get fucked."
there's that word again.  as i told you, i wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
wait for what?
i should really give him a call.  he's a character, isn't he.  well, not to you. i meant to us squares in the outside world.
just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee.
sure...go ahead.
red, i --
if they can give kissenger the peace prize, i wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find i'd won the preakness.
and wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
... what?
oh aye, a sledge.
i mean breakfast.
because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
look, can't someone help me?
this here's a strike.
what?  what, that guy?
arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
oh..
i did? what do i tell a source on the next tough story? hang in with us. you'll be fine... maybe?
do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
amy's been lying again.
you have nothing to fear.  you're safe again.
must be another johnson then.  been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
last night he proposed to me.
don't worry about it. just be smart.
i'm not good in math.
well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
well, i'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator!
they decided to no-file. tell me where you are and i'll bring you your money.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. sticking up right through the living room. somebody like to explain that to me?
it's not the failure. i feel that macfarlane has taught me nothing. he taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. we have work to do.
he never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
i... i don't understand.
thanks.
it sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
couldn't be better. these're boom times in retailing. we're opening another store, big dave's annex, there on garson. this is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. matter of fact, i'm thinking of making doris the comptroller. how're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
damn right i'm scared.
haven’t you heard the news?  so is she.
fellow called lime.
you said, you were in the bad lands?
south african women are very sporty.
lydia.  lydia what?
you still seeing that shrink?
oklahoma city.  jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
thanks for coming.
you're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
kids are supposed to get detention.
we're screwed.
you have family here also?
i think you're here all day.
sit down and eat. till i say the word, you're doing what you're told.
-- we don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
we'll work it out...
what do they have in there that's so valuable?  a cure for aids, a cure for cancer?
don't go reading my lips, man. that's an intrusion. save that shit for the sniper school. comprende?
has he?
it wasn't even his terrible taste. it was his daughter's.
i have to talk to you.
gieg, chuck.
whatever you hear about me, you agree.
what's fascinating is that it's physical. you know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. but on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
i'm tired of being a flag.  i want to be a bull again.  lets get out of here, joe. let's blow.
how... how can you say that to me...?
no, to you--m'sieu <u>monescu</u>.
i'm sorry.  i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  it must've been the bars.
what was it?
oh, you gonna make me say it.
i'm no cat.  i'm just an assistant. a <u>secretary</u> --
claire...
sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. i never had it like you when i was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
'when applied directly to another person, thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the devil.'
that's what i came to tell loretta. there's been a miracle.
oh no.  i couldn't let it out of my house.  you'll have to finish it here.
hi, artie.
well, you were!
that's all you have to say?
great to be drunk. sobriety's killing me.
i'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
lisa, please!
i apologize for making you wait -- i've brought some new evidence with me --
i can't pick you up.
someplace else, then.
she did?
then why did you come here?
becky?
there are no versions of the truth! this isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
oh je -- couldn't he sleep with rita? we'11 all have a good time.
he married for love -  that's why he did everything.  that's why he went into politics.  it seems we weren't enough.  he wanted all the voters to love him, too.  all he really wanted out of life was love. that's charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  you see, he just didn't have any to give.  he loved charlie kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, i guess he always loved her.  as for emily - well, all i can tell you is emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and i guess there are.  i guess there's more than two sides -
i'm sorry for everything.
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow?
you're not going to drive!
i've got her.
what?
okay, don't stop.
we're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
we're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
he wants to speak with you.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew i'd be here... and gives a performance! out of nowhere - gives a performance!
yeah, i guess so. i'm real tired, you know that. a kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
and put them out.  some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  the future is much more interesting than the past.  don't you think?
is it that music?
yeah.
yeah.
are you serious?
beware.
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
-- i pose you the same question --
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob, standing and holding his jacket.
leonard.
where's mr maccarron?
jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  leave off.  here's your paper.
always.
why?
you don't know who he is?
shh!
one hundred kilometers...
no?
but you're an actor. i hear these hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
you haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
the blue men?
i think it could be fun.
just breathe normally.
it comes back.  flashes.  my name.
don't have to tell me twice.
what is it?
steady on, treves. have a seat.
i have just come from the palace. the post has been filled.
thanks, i needed that.
goodnight.
well, i always liked you, mike.
mom -- why does mr. carpenter have to go down to the police station?
leave him till we can get some help.  from now on, nobody comes down here.
first thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  alan has put together sort of a training program
what whistle?  there's no fucking whistle.  this is fucking dangerous.
the window...
for you.  i want you to know, simone appreciates you all working for scale.  but why am i thanking you? simone can thank you herself.  she insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  she's on the line now.
i like to talk to the person who runs the service.  can you give me address?
on a sauvignon blanc?
yes.
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards. my own wife included.
we are happy, mrs. romari, because you have everything —— and i am happy because i have nothing to lose.
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we haven't got the power of attorney yet!
thanks.
i couldn't do that.  you might hurt someone.
go ahead.
what bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, mr. doe. there were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
we are?
you're a movie buff?
that's the rub.  i liked wade.  who's ryan?  if they're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other, how do i choose?  look at my hand, there it goes again.
oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
you couldn't be.  look, barry. there's going to be people from laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums.  how are you going to cope with them?
what do you think?
when? how?
they were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
you got a back door to this place?
can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
it happens, larry. people make mistakes.
how the fuck should i know!!
well, what are we going to do about it? where is he?
then you get mom the hell out.  but dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  we don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
i want to call her and tell her i'm okay. that we're okay.
around.
oh, leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her. today i found out such strange things ——frightening things. i saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— i feel as if i'd never known her.
i'm glad you asked...i'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  and what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. now:  you want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  you have to plan for a waterford that does not exist.  not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
now you'll be mine, cindy.
i don't know.
i will never forgive you.
you don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but i might be able to help.
yes.
had to be done.
it's just a place for workmen.
i won't disturb anything, mr. yow, i promise. be gone before you know it.
what?
dodge, get on that turbine. i don't care if you don't sleep for a week. the sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. how's the food situation?
please, we hardly know each other.
everything you say sounds reason- able. but there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
christ, can't you read between the lines!  he did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
no, he hasn't.  if i offended you, i'm sorry.
no i'm sorry, now i have to get off the phone....
all right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. that's all i'm saying. it's all that i'm saying.
give me money or i'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
that's little egotistical.
i've since changed my mind. i designed this place, based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. mccay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. it's a tax write off. on the books everything looks kosher. i have an office on 5th that i haven't seen in ten years.
why?
hruphh...?
you can't talk to it?
how's the rest of the gang? you seen anyone?
that's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
anything it samples by physical contact.
is it the machines? the noise? the people?
and i you.
stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
really?
i feel like i'm being drawn and quartered. like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
you don't understand.
by what you preach...none!
and it was the last. hasn't written a letter since. not even a birthday card.
that <u>is</u> the plan...i mean, goddamn it!  what the hell are those things?  how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?
you were going to have this thug...?
i don't think so. it's like a tv station. and they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
why, does it look like it's bothering me? what do i give a fuck?  fuckin' oscar too. all the fuckin' money i've given that prick, he don't even look over here. what's his problem?
with respect, sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
nooo...  no!  stop!
but you don't keep a cat, do you?
she got me thinking...
he saved mrs. halpern? please, the twisted fuck.
okay.  the police are gonna need your full name and address.
are you alright?
i didn't ask you to....
jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
i wanted to be a good one.
i got a goddamn plan!!
you tit.  i soiled my armour i was so scared!
it has to do with my father.
we were partners.  if it weren't for luther i'd still be hustlin' pinball down at gianelli's.  i don't need anything more than i got.
sounds reasonable.
inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  all parts intact.
i was trying not to tell you...
just a few minutes ago.
i didn't?
i'm sorry, diane, but i'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the virgin mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
but we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
no need to thank me, if you don't want to.  just pay for these drinks.
we are both full of shit.
what did she say?
nineteen!  my dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
yes.  is he there?
what is it?
what do i think?  i think if those marines from powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
we sure don't aim to cause any trouble... yeah, she seems to grow on you.
what's happening?
i don't know.
that's a good age.
rae!
why don't you go on. we'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes.
sound nice?  it's a fucking drug rehab farm.  it's where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  meanwhile, you get educator of the year i mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  reason?  they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  now tell me i'm right.
it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....
i *don't* think that's the thing to do! no! i think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
elizabeth --  turner.  i'm a maid in the governor's household. 
that depends on what they see.
i can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
hey ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a no fags allowed rule?
it doesn't have to be like that.  we don't have to be enemies.
yeah, ma, i love him awful.
but they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
eleven fifteen.
me?
mr. khan said they called you brave.
no.
yes -- just exactly.
oh, professor tripp? you know, last semester, what i said that time in office hours -- i hope there's no hard feelings.
yeah.
yeah.
good question. you took the bait.
no ...
a madman.
what can i do? except maybe pass out?
i want blood
and... may i kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
we will, baby...all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
why?
be right down.
yeah.  okay.  well, good luck tracy
i don't want you talking to jerry.
what's it to you?
uh-h-h-h...nothing!  uh, nothing. i'm sure andy was just a little excited, that's all.  too much cake and ice cream, i suppose.  it's just a mistake.
i think you're a dangerous man, mr. dowd.
no, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
i believe we share an art instructor
no. he was strong, he lasted almost a month. my mother - died when i was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... after he left me, i had nobody. i was ten years old.
oh...
no, not yet. as i said, we're not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
my mood ring! it fell off! i gotta find it!
i think i'd better choose the menu.  after all, you're learning how to be me, i'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
yes, no.
i feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  but hey, what'd i expect?
sorry.
maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
it's miles. listen, i don't know if you even care, but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did. i think you're great, maya -- always have. from the first time you waited on me.  and while i'm at it, i guess you should know that my book is not getting published. i thought this one had a chance, but i was wrong. again. don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. so you see i'm not much of a writer. i'm not anything really. the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. we're leaving in the morning, and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.
the test of a soldier is not in his arm. it's here.
decontamination -- ?
i have an alternate version of the first chapter.
i think our secret is out. they're headed right for us.
you think he's for real?
not here... alone.  please.
what?
just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, i guess.
watch out!
do this for me, marla.  do this for me, if you never do anything else...
he's not a man, he's a god.
it's my day off.
not without leeloo.
you and mel gordon?
yep. i remember you got caught in my parents' room with caitlin once.
yeah. because at one time, i didn't think enough.
yorgi and kirill.
and what about the ones you don't save?
no, you're only going to hurt him some more.
i wish they had.  he takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  but you can't kill a man like fanucci.
anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. i've wanted to leave many times, but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. anyway, i'm rambling. if you're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. doyle is a monster. not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. a dangerous person. i've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. maybe even kill one of them. i see it in his eyes. i'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. doyle will make your life hell. you're a perfect target. when i first saw you i was afraid of you. not really afraid, i guess, just taken aback. but also, i felt a real sensitive feeling from you. and for some reason, frank has adopted you. much like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it like that. in a good way. anyway, i just want you to know what you're in for. i have a good feeling about you. you're good for frank. maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a bad way.  there's one more thing. it's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. but what i see before me is a gentle, simple man. all i want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around linda and frank. you know. you would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
at present the girls only peck me. their cruelty surely will wreck me. but one little beak in my own, and i'll up to heaven be flown! at present the girls only peck me. but one little beak in my own, and i'll up to heaven be flown. up to heaven be flown! up to heaven be flown!
what??
sir... estimating one nautical mile.
and your head is hot.
you'd rather spoil our walk home.
i think i do.
i'm all ears.
ah, go chase yourself. i'll take my business elsewhere. and for future reference, you are no longer welcome at ray's boom-boom room.
what?
you went to rekall, remember?
no, he didn't.
a.p.b.... he isn't breaking any law.  he's a grown man... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do.
well, has your majesty considered what napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
forget it, carmen. the mobile infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
how much time do you have?
everything human don't have to look like you and me....
nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there's nothing supernatural about greed. and that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
meet me here today at seven o'clock. with the money. then we'll go see the film.
i haven't seen anybody come by.
put in a quarter.
at some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
what one?
no, no, no, no. we must leave.
actually, mel does his own ass work. why wouldn't he?  it's delicious.
hey, guys, i got a game to pitch.
i see.
because i'm a newspaper woman, heaven help me!
that's easy for you to say! you can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
stop kidding.  i want to know what happened.
for supplies, you drive.
yes, i'm afraid i did.
leave? that's exactly what i came here to ask you to do. leave! i don't mean this hotel and i don't mean paris... i mean france. there's a plane for moscow at five-forty.
you wouldn't?
well, of course. we always welcome friends.
i got him.
what? no! look.
well, i don't do it for just anybody.
why, yes.  why?
<u>that</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
it beets being on the mainland.
what?
we've been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
how many bodies did you find?
good for you. you do know something.
name so susie barrington.  daughter of the eminent historian, anne barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous matthew byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
i have the director's word, there will be no action against them. you may go once we have the disks.
schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
i'll give you anything you want. anything!  please!
what could i be up to, lula?
that's the second time i ran it, and it still reads the same.
no, hallie, i'm not gonna take you down too. i'll be alright.
gee guys, that's swell of you. but  . . . i've got another idea.
not at present.
too early to tell.
i'11 take my chances, thank you. it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
a writer? what do you write... letters an' such?
they appear to be authentic.
i have no life anymore.  i ruined your life, make me pay for it.
you're a cowboy, you're a brother.  come back, no hard feelings.
oh my god!
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me. toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
precisely, maria. tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
now, mimi, there are a thousand detectives in new york.  hire one of them.
well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
shit, jeff!
all right. two hundred.
we take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. no prisoners, dillon.
yeah, well, i lost my pen. by the time i got a new one, i was clean out of paper.
have fun storming the castle.
you know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. you can buy child whores, slaves. you can have people raped, killed...  one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan. he usually isn't in this country.  how'd you hear about him?
is that what i think it is?
and how many have paid the price for your impatience? how many have died? how much damage have you done... and what is yet to come?
don't know. she keeps screaming to stay out. he keeps screaming to stay out. we decided to stay out.
how many of you did dr. soong make?
in other words.
maybe it's better that way.
and you must be doc holliday.
right at the back there.  middle shelves.  coupla folders.  nice stuff. i'd do you a good price.
i don't quite follow you.
mccone's been notified and is coming back from the west coast. carter's here, though.
lucy isn't you. we're losing something without you being here. now, i know this is a rough time for you, but i think we should make another arrangement.
try not to think of that, mrs. brenner.
i asked him, "lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  and he said, "bomb the shit out of hanoi, boy!  bomb them where they live." ... john, do you think i was too soft on tv?
yes.  they were there... so, it must be.
where are you going?
what's wrong?
if an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
thank you!
time and space have no meaning out here.  we're living in einsteinian equation.
yes.
well, i've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
oh, you can tell her later. she'll never miss you in this crowd.
and what are you? a cop?
fine. your mail's on the kitchen table. mostly junk. oh, there's a letter from alex trebek.
what?
what about?
craig stole maxine from me, dr. lester.
huh?  oh, come on, sis.  i'm tellin' ya, we can't play clue with just two people.
really?  is the food that bad?
yes, it's true.  they're going to make it public wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
do you know how they were damaged?
is what you said about the ring but another dream?
man, forget you then, stupid.
tried to. sit down, will you?
yes.
okay.
by the way--did you hear a shot last night?
hmm, as in -- that's interesting. sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
you bring the best out in a man.
fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.

hunh-uh.  not yet.  look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
parry... i'm jack.
what i want is to help my father.

the greatest.  they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors.  hey, easy on the punch bowl.  budget only calls for three drinks per extra. fake the rest.
yeah... mmmm...
i'm with <u>you!</u>
you've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
what about it?
shhh!  they're sleeping.
you are the princess.
do you have the name i wrote down?
y-yes sir.
well, i've been watching you. i've watched you eat, i've watched you speak, i've watched the way you move, and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. and you know what?
that is how v'ger will survive.
but they can't do that. you haven't even got the vote.
let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
he's in the insurance business.
sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
you should have gone to the funeral.
you manage to throw me off balance.  i adore you.
let the record state the witness has identified, diego delgado.
how ya feeling?

yes, thank you.  intravenous if possible.
my name's john klute.
sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
what did you think i would do?  jesus christ!  i gave up my life and my music...
no, you stay calm, doctor! but you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  why, are you attracted to me? perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and i'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "doctor?"
routine! i don't have a routine. and if you think that's what this is -
much better.  you've been gone so long.
uh-huh.
hey, once a driver, always a driver.  you want a lift?  i've just got one more pickup.
you don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
i could have struck off his head just now!
come on.
i can't do that.
i think we get the gist.
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
helen got it for me in oslo.
- that's what i mean!
oh, is he dead?
yes, i remember you mentioning it. i got mine about the same time.
i'm sorry?
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara.  privately.  i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

va-yomer adonai el avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...

no way, no way, this is crazy.

i'm here, roy, but i'm, uh, kind of busy.  let's talk later, okay?
huh?
why?
yeah.
that you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
no.
absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
he killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's murmur increases. kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
manual overrides aren't working.  i'm getting nothing, lieutenant.
--truman, you're gonna be late!
i stand corrected.  wyatt.  you're an oak.
oh, now-- 
don't stop!
you mean they knew who i was?
no, i'll wash them. i'll take them home and bring them back.
who are you?
yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
the colonel helped me work it out.
i am.  he has always been our greatest protector.
i was sort of hoping to get out of--
that's yes?
really? they were..
do you now.
what the hell do you think? i love ann. you think i'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
do what the gentleman says, howard.
you, too, ma...

you're my conscience.
hello.
hey, tim.
what do you mean?
sit down.
he's here.
what are you doing here? i thought you had retired from field reporting?
that's some cold shit.
yes, of course.
she's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
how do you know?
i know but i felt like taking a shift.
i'm only good at making people laugh.
you've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. ellie and i got married because we love each other. and she's proving it; as far as i'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
you paying for the gas?
ellie.  arroway.
i'll get right on it.
that thing's dead. what the hell are we waiting for?
no, i'm not.
the borg.  some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
the amish boy saw him, paul. i'll make it, but set donahue and the homicide department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
okay. see ya.
kill him.
yeah, you can.  you could just quit.  people do it all the time.
you gotta give me a day.  i need a day.  he's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  we got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. issue is as a bulletin.  he's got some rare strain of...
you're doing it for me is all you need to know. you only know that because you need to know.
my back hurts, my skin. did i get burned? i hope to god i'm not burned.
no.  missing teenager.  disappeared thirty years ago.  found her bones last week.  buried behind some old diner, up by dyckman street.  mary finelli.
i don't know. my mind wanders.
mike, are you crazy, i'm your brother.
that young lady's size, right'cher.
well. i suppose it does a bit. i'm very happy for them, of course, but i'm going to miss them. the ship will seem... incomplete without them.
so do i -- i'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
what're you doing out of uniform, sid? you don't want to get in trouble.
what are your people called?
yes. i have been seeking my friends.
is there shrimp on it?
'amen i say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
you lied to me!
i know. i'm kidding you. chill out.
nah... scotch.
when?
and what're you whispering for?
i don't believe you!
i already know. the "slow club." it's on route 7.
i don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  something under the floors, not on the plans. i don't know!
not our kind of people, you understand.
or albertus magnus. cornelius agrippa...
that is the point... and skipper'll slip off the hook.
my husband...
come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
i'm sorry esther, i just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
says who?!
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
come on, i'll show you around.
hi, hello, great.  this is seduce and destroy?
26   continued:  
yes, baron.
there are no ghosts, ellie. i want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
how do you do.
ucch, really? you're kidding. god. bizarre small world, huh? yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
that's stupid. what are the odds of you being seen with me?
yeah, well, i wish god would go a little easy on the trumpets.
everybody goes home!
if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max, max has agreed to deliver job to me. iíll have claire and luther stickell with me on the train.  marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris.
calm down, please. this man needs help and you need protection from him. that's obvious.
wire pull over?
when you make sense i'll listen.
look, why don't you just call diane again?
i don't got no daddy, you dig? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
... straight out?
please. you and the other elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  which, of course, they do.
that's right.  i wasn't there.  i don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
nothing personal.
you know what i've been through. don't ever scare me like that.
do you want i send it to your room?
not eight...
i don't know, but what i do know is that there's no more harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. i think, if i get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
no... no, please... you cannot...
i've been on another case. all day.  i suppose i can move it over. seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
i'm sure it don't.
annie...got an umbrella...?
all right, you didn't know.
what d'you mean?
yes, your highness.
well, why not do it? there's a job for you. get a bill started to accomplish it--present it to congress-- it would be a great experience--
take plenty of cigars.
it's not something i wanted either.
c'mon, valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  i mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place?
yeah, it sucks.
yeah.
i'm afraid so; he's an idealist. you'll have to be politic.
when it comes? what'd you tell him?
she's beautiful -- isn't she?
all in due course, ann. our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to london.
that maid just quit.  the place is a mess.  you can start in the master bedroom.
she's remaining in her room. she isn't feeling very well.  now please go on without me. i eat very little.
 two pots of coffee...
you're blind --
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
that there isn't one, as of today. i had my period.  i couldn't believe it. he still wanted to marry me.
what’s that? a word?
yeah...?
calm down, kid. stand still.
you know, i-i think... if i could pry this door off... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. they don't run around.
does that scare you?
the dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
can we come in?
everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
you were in the car with bob?
how was the sex?
i'm a rapper.
and this is why you never told the d.a.
i like it here, dennis.  i'm never going to leave.
my name is donnie smith and i have lot's of love to give.
you make me laugh much more than ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  but i already knew you could make me laugh.  it's everything else i don't know about.
i'm not sure i hear a question in there?
what is that door?
i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel.  all i need is some money for the room.
all right.
yes, i go now.
precisely.
scout?
china.
flew?! oh, come on benny...
why?
well, what makes you think i haven't?
hello, miss wells.
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities? the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
because your mother and i need the rest, sugar. now buzz.
do you know the story of "the headless horseman?"
i'll be back.
i had a good teacher. mclean versus urban transport...
what is it?
...but:  this particular statue...
tea would be nice.
can't wait, pal, can't wait.
i'm so use to seeing bones. it's weird to see skin.
well don't go forgetting your friends.
you mean, i have your permission?
elephants! make way... i gotta get elephants!
one shuts it down, one turns arms it.
where are we?
a patient pickup and transfer to smith's grove.
wish you weren't.
you're foreigners.
yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
you know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  sometimes i think... i think - i should a married someone, like you did.  to have kids, to have a family.
and i love and admire him more than any man i ever knew. i read these poems. he's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. what i have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing i have ever done and the most disillusioning.
meaning, viznick's a man who answers to no one.  not even god.
he's just being nice.
oh, really.  general salazar was there?
me, i'll know!
if you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
i say we tape him to a chair.
what are you talking about?
you think, in the sphere --
boy!  <u>somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
come with me now! come with me now. come with me now. i want you out of here.
something exotic i hope.
the police... the horrible ghastly police. they beat me up, sir. the police beat me up, sir. mr. alexander stares at him. it becomes apparent he is insane.
there?
if everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
jesus, tom walls, that crazy motherfucker.
what does it mean?
ma, what's wrong?
please...
i'm coming.
the pleasure is all mine.
no! please! please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
now that's pretty important, dean. you also told the fbi when you met him, he was six foot two.  then you tell the commission he was five foot eight.  how the hell did the man shrink like that, dean?
all right.  i'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
--i'm not here.
i'll make you a deal.  get out of here. right now.  i'll do the job with the snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
kate, give your old man a little credit. every person who chooses the service of god as their life's work has something in common. i don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a buddhist monk. many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am i a fool? we've all done it. i'm not going through a lapse. what i've experienced is closer to awakening. i'm not trying to shake your faith. i've just decided not to devote my life to god anymore.
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- i'll assume that's not your given name--
boat or no boat...i'm going...
just for a few hours.  julie'll be with you.
well, of course. your old d-a-d! you know i'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
benjamin -- where are you?
haldeman too?
why --
how is he - ?
you think so?
a small one...your brother won't be here....
yeah.
it belongs to pop.
i'm hungry, mom....
david? how'd you get this number?
yeah, but...
hard.
how could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
james'll know about george sanders.
thank you, frances. and after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at hollywood's own roosevelt hotel!
that ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
no.
woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
honey, come here.
you mean, before she sank.
it's chemistry, andy. nothing more. mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. there were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to.
i told him you were my boyfriend.
yeah.
i don't know.
why point it at me?  i'm the real thing.
yes, ma'am...
dad's like doing his up with people routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
where, the mall?
fay, i'll call you back.  what did you say?
i deserve it.
i have a class. i'm late.
yes.
do we shake hands?
it turns to steaming piss.
no.  you will not run me out.  no one will believe a word of what you say.
come on!
it was all keaton. we followed him from the beginning.
no! it can't be!
i took mrs. holland to the houmfort.  i thought they might cure her.
you're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
look.
fuck you; i gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. you lie		   * to yourself! you don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. so you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
oh, all right.
what about rugs? i thought we were stopping at mansour?
infant death, he calls me. sweet daughter death. you know what he calls you? merciful death.
that's not true.
<u>were</u> you, sir?  can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
yeah, just started.
no. i was going to come up. i wanted to ask you to marry me. 
trouble. why?
well--sure, i could do that--
that sounds fine.
you're a ringer.  she brought you in to replace me.  out with the old.
to make me wretched in two weeks.
for god's sake, mrs. robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. you give me a drink. you put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
look at you, you-you're such a clown.
anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
this one's history. moving on...
hail, mary.
oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now, if i chose.
hurray for the bulldog!  half past eleven!  the shows have just let out.  people are going to night clubs and restaurants.  of course, we're different.  we live in a palace - at the end of the world.
only holds five.
i'm nauseous.  oh, jesus, now i don't get to do the tv show?
your girl friend.  she says she can't make it tonight.  you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. i'll kill you, you bastard!
so?
but in your opinion, would i definitely go?
she's a trainee, just like the others.  why are you coming down so hard?
why would i?
you're probably the only one who could carry it off.
for instance?
i have to work on my video project! don't follow me!  i can put myself to bed.
what do you think he did?
whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
a leech on the welfare state in addition. you don't miss a trick.
no.  no.
no, tell me.
we're going to do this.
alright.
you have personally -
what could i do?  he's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. i'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. happens every day. at least to women like me.
but what about them?
beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
why?
--the lookout in the motor inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
i'll go -- good-bye.
yeah, i figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
why not?
gary.
i lied. the house is alive and we're all gonna die.
ok, bob. i don't know his name. you know why? because i don't care. he's future man. but i care about you. and to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. will you get in the car, bob? this is stupid.
better get me another sam's.  join me in a jaeger shot?
sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
you have to stop this!
you know these doctors could have settled out of court. they wanted a trial. they wanted to clear their names.
'able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
i'd prefer you didn't.  i'm very busy.
i don't care. i'm not staying out late doug.
that what you do?
excuse me, but -  i must formally protest this meeting. given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or mi-6.  this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty's royal navy.
all right.  here.
great. i've just started a new company. solid financing. it's good.  i love you jacko, you know that
god!
it wasn't me before, james.  it's become me now because of...what's happening.  please untie me.
oh, i was scared of the same thing, heather. the minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
shit. we're fucked.
i'll find someplace.
oh my god!
why are you following me?
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
miss caswell got lucky too late. the audition is over.
oh. 
don't ask me, but he's on his way.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
all right.  heads i go -- tails i stay to write the story. ready?
perhaps... perhaps... i'm afraid i must first ask you to pass a test. i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
search me. i guess we're abandoned.
twenty!
...would you, would you call him up. i'll give you my number, and ask him...
i just want to see beast.  where would you go?
no, it could take me hours. you know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - i wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
stop--stop right here.
hi. how are you doing?
where's the ether? this mescaline isn't working.
fuck you. i can carry it.
what's your problem?
was she helpful?
who?
where are you?
oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
we'll rent some at the bathhouse. how about you, josephine?
sleep well.
i'm gonna wet my pants.
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
it ain't for lack of trying.
yes sir.
i just know.
ah! you have questions?
where is he? where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
where?
same with me, pretending i was you. an impulse.  why not?  i had this shoe.
what the fuck're you talking about? the carrier.  what's in the fucking carrier?
split it up. any word on donny?
what?
okay--that's enough!
so, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
i knew it.
yes.
okay.
you read about it, i'm sure.
i'm going to hang up now, miles.
i don't know.  there's a lot of space up here.  they could be just about--
we're sure as hell not going back out there"
what has?
it should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa.
my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never been. she loves me the way i am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> i don't want everything to change. i don't want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.
frank galvin. we've met before.
i'm sleepy.
what is this, emmi?
i think that you and i are natural enemies.
you disappeared.
one's enough.
oh, that'll be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.  'lo, earl. how are you feeling?
the police are waiting for you up ahead. there's a roadblock. you have to go back.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
we tried.  bulkhead door's rusted shut. won't budge.
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  from the gitgo, from jump street.
bye.
four, five miles.
ahh, she will be yours.
she almost sounds scared.
she said michael.
he's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i'm gone...i'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
i had to.
like what?
well, not too, i mean, a little.
all right, lunger.  have at it.
did they kill him?
did you not hear me? we can't give out no information.
...and six...
oh, god...
you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
just like that?
whew.
listen, claude, maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
i feel as though i've stepped into a time warp!
i don't know.
power?
to throw out of the window.
you're referring, of course, to chairing the special operations group as vice president.
gave them the day off....
hey, you wouldn't believe this. two minutes ago, the knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
i spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
the handle is heavy.  and the blade is no ordinary metal.  still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. you're just not used to handling it.
the rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
rosa, i can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
outfit? what's he talking about?
fuck you both! ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  best play it safe, and spill it all.
what's the bad news?
yeah, i guess so.
it did?
the glengarry...the premium leads...? i'd say we got five thousand.  five. five thousand leads.
it better be worth it for me.
i don't know if luck's the word. are you feeling alright?
yeah! well, i do the firing, too. remember that, duffy, and keep a civil tongue in your head.
he was thinking of you, marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
i'm here now, jamie.  you're going to live. you have to.
i did?
and you just happened to run into her.  great.  what's she do?  she work?
they really have to work on that street name thing.
george.  oh, jesus christ, george.  look at you.
i miss her.
and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
uh-huh.
just what you think i mean.
who said anything about surgery...it'll only take a moment.
well, i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, fettes.  take a look at the child.
you're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
i should go
the only thing that scares me, mister o'connell, are your manners.
bud.
there's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
what's a moral orgasm john? tell me how it feels exactly.
maintenance.
rogers isn't even pretending.  he isn't just scared anymore.  he's sick.  frank norris told me last night he hasn't known rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
yes -- of course -- all i'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
yeah -- i'm giving up the apartment.
get me a typewriter.  i'll finish the notice.
of course. it's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
i'm sorry.
good. you've both been working close to the front.
none of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
why not?
thank you.  thank you very much.
i don't want to move again... i like it here.
it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. could he swim?
you don't seem quite sure, jessica.  can you do it? will you?
i dunno. i mean, it was kind of preachy. chaos-this, chaos-that. and like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
what about marla?
i don' t know. when i was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. they bore her away with them. months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
i was born in new york city if that'll help you any.
god i hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
now. now! i have to go now. i have to see the frozen charles! now! tonight!
okay!
well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
sure.  where to?
forget it.
by "they" you mean...?
look, i'm desperate. i'll try anything. but what if you can't snap me out of it?
well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
sue. his dad was big johnny cash fan.
terrorist.  radical agitator.  stool pigeon.
how do you know that?
what are we going to do about this?
excuse me, sir.  i have an actual fact for you.
i'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  johnny roselli is on his way back here.
what do you think about when you're having sex?
when does frederick ever come with her?
aha. poet or philosopher?
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions.
no. we have ways of digging out knowledge. but it takes longer. he is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. he blames himself for what happened to the woman. and we know little of the background.
you should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  new hampshire ...
jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
he was my father's best friend!
hot pants, please. i'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with smokey on my tail. can you lock it off behind me?
no, sir...
you're going to blow it, peggy sue. nobody treats charlie bodell like this.
thank you.
what are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
you sober?
take your time.  don't worry about the elves.  they won't come out here.
you know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  i must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. by the way, it's time i gave you something. come with me.
the carlsons' are here.
i'm not nick!  you thought you'd fuck him over?! well he's fucked you! i've never worked at some casino! i can't help you! because he's not me!
that's just it huey. the pigs don't know how many panthers there are. both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. we're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
ok, ok. i'm back.
well what you reading it for?
behold!
you'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night.
good. good. good. well, that's good.
what was that?
yeah, bu-bu-but why?
all right, i take it back.
that's nice.
goddamnit, scooter, come on. pardon my language, ma'am.
please stop -- please!
why do you think marty came here tonight? because he cares about your department. you don't know how hard he works. you don't know about his programs helping west side --
yes.
well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. i traced the hacker's call. the secret service picked him up this morning. i'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then i can eliminate it.
how do you mean?
then that's what i meant.  fired. canned.  out on my fanny.  the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police.  just like that.
no... forget it...
if you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. you go out and chum for him.
i didn't know... i didn't...  it was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... i...
what can we do?  you don't even know who this guy is.
yah, i don't need no sealant though.
i just want some fresh air.
you don't understand...
uh.  you hate my guts?
why?
right.  will you help us?
the best explanation is always the simplest one. let's wait. let's wait and see. in the meantime try not to worry.
that i cannot tell you.
mafhkin oble groop...
six weeks ago. he bought a boy of yours.
you expect me to just walk in there?
oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, missus. it's just the 9th.
just take a look at it. 
it's a rough translation from the moldavian.
i'm not wearing a wire. this is just between you and me.
dick.
actually, they disgust me.  but that's what i love about them.  like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
this is general ripper speaking.
we were probably in school together.  you went to berkley?
it's possible.
about - thirty-four seconds.
next stop: the 2:45 to detroit rock city!
i don't have a problem with it.
sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
nobody's asking you to.
one more time would be nice.
aye, aye, captain....
he's dead, chance! the old man's dead!
he kissed her.
listen, i gotta problem. this girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
for example, at this moment the film's out of focus. go see.
why do i think there's never been a ripley rainy day?
i'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when i'm done. i'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  i'm gonna . . .
yeah, i can see that.
what about her teeth? what about her fangs?
great.
i'm going to quit.  that's what has to happen first.  then we're going to tell him.
good for you. go find out.
he had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
maybe we should just listen to the radio.
well, you can. you always could.
ben did this.
hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
fuuuuuuck -- u!
well, big ol' lincoln, sure. guess i would have flirted with him too.
that's probably good.
why did you -- with sandy?
i, i, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  i can't hear anything.
they hate my music. it terrifies them. the only sound italians understand is banality. tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to resurrection!  ba-ba! ba-ba! ba-ba! ba-ba! anything else is morbid.
i've been better --
hold on, alice.
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here.
i'm not honest?
where is she?
i want you to come in till i get the lights on.
who?
thank you-
except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
your timing is excellent, mr. scott. you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. how much refit time till we can take her out again?
nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since arsonist's daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
out where?
we need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
how can i be together if i'm not together?
i hate tears. 
no.
i didn't give him anything . you were the big-hearted gal. how about wiring your father now?
what?
who is he?
what's the question nobody's asking? why that building? why not the federal building?
you will follow me.
the drums. he taught me to play some.
no, i told you.  a whiff of perfume on his shirt.
thanks, thanks.
no i don't.  you sure you haven’t seen her?
when will they be back?
oh, thank god. it's going.
suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
what'd you do? wire one of your friends for money?
what about them?
like winton marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  louis was playing.  god was smiling.
the two kids?
you pawned it.
we must do something.
i see.
poor man had to leave town.  and i hear that other women came forward.
how did you--
i am.
i think so.
that?  oh, it's a kind of chinese fighting... i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco.  her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  i've got a book on it, if you're interested.
th—that's all right. if you didn't call me sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  there are snickers from the background.
how come?
this is how i dress all the time.
cuba would be a small price to pay.
where?
what did your wife get her?
aaron, how you doin'?
fine. actually, today was a good day. you should have seen her.
don't you see? -- healy lied to us about everything! the landlord said when he got back from miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary!
why do they do that?
where i saw you.  everything going okay now?  you live around here?
you remind me so much of nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
you haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! where you taking him?
let me into your world walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
she did like you, she helped and trusted you! you paid her back by trying to take bill away!
louis, are you pro-vichy or free french?
don't you see? whatever's going on... i'm part of it.
that's no secret. i'm five.
that's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
what is this about?
hi, han... chewie.
hello.  do you see anyone else around here with a band, mr. branson?  mr. phil spector?
really, eve? why?
company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
learning language.
sure.
them was nickel apiece candy.
oh, you know, the usual.  bowl. drive around.  the occasional acid flashback.
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, i'd arrest you right here.
if not for me, at least for amy.
female...
it's wonderful.
it doesn't look all that different.
well, listen, uh... good luck with the joint, huh? 
sounds like a plan.
figured you did.
she's an attractive older woman.
keep it dry.  no swimming.
yeah well, sobo's kid needs braces.
you're in my head? you don't know my name?
*all right*, then. after all, what's it to me? so they *drop* him out of a balloon. all i care is--i don't want to be around. see? squeamish. see? that's what i am. no, sir. i don't have to take it. won't be a party to no murder. i'm gonna quit. i'm through.
that's enough, bobby. i think it's time you went to bed.
with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! plus, i'm popular... you want to be popular... i can recognize a cry for help when i see one.
yeah, or d, it's a dumb fucking idea...
gee, um...  i...i don't know what to say.
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
we're on our way, baby.
why are you so uptight?
eh?
how's it going?
i told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  we want to take care of it ourselves and we will. i'll find him.  i swear i will.
what?
now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
--harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
everybody love linda.
shortly after i arrived at danbury federal correctional institute i related to diego that the crime i was in for was smuggling marijuana. diego told me he had high level connections in colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into america...
i'm here!  sarah, i'm here!  i'm here--i've got you!
we should talk.
you know, if anyone else told me that, i'd have serious doubts.  but coming from you, i can't honestly say i'm surprised.
i can live with that.
we need to hurry.
you're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
pay him.
what?
maybe they're not out there.
how mr. kastle?
please look at me. you must believe me -- you must believe that i love you -- that i have never known what love is -- until last night. 
he drives a carriage.
i saw his soul wesley. he was face to face with his god, and no one lies in that situation. but your geronimo act rattled me, and i abandoned my instincts.  never abandon you instincts.
i did?
it's okay. it's okay.
exactly.
of course.  and is he your favourite italian film director?
no thanks.  sounds good though.
help me.
there wasn't any way to explain it.
i don't smoke.
don't cut me.
i met a girl.
yes, you did.
i mean what did we know about anything?
a wolf without a foot!
me?  sing?
uh, yes, sir.  the monroe hotel...
whaddya mean?
you haven't switched it on.
you're going to kill him?  kill morpheus?!
you think i'm after money? i told you, my friend. anarchy. time for a change. money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
what ?
this is going to be very difficult for you at accept, mr. quaid.
a television set?
male.
back to mexico.
no fucking way.
ohhh yes.  no, no.  just a little, you know...we're fine.
yeah, live on my salary - that is, until i finish writing my play.
it's ok to ask that.
respect your elders and your betters!
is chopping firewood in the back garden. honora approaches him.
yeah!
and you know what i thought then, kate?  i thought, i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much.  i still hope that.
ask monsieur rick.
we oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
i didn't find what i was looking for.
plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
i beg your pardon?
good-bye, darling.
i bet.  that was our rent!
don't you want it?
well, when you're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
her old boyfriend?
yes. michael myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
yeah. and right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
what'd neptune tell you?
go ahead, bird dog.
to finish last evening's delightful work.
we don't need to know.
have you got that in writing? 
i was sent as a military surgeon to south africa. stinking climate. taken prisoner. home on parole not to fight. i was a surgeon in the great war till the end. grenade in the face. carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. isolated two years.  i've been everything.
i'm sorry.
i mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
how much can you bench?
no.  that sounds more important. let's forget about tonight.
from what i've seen, mr. galvin, you have a very good case...
he described me down to a t. knows what jude looks like.
okay...
follow me.
where did you get this clown?
no way.
iraqi's won't buy it. either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
so that's it --  you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham.
hello, bob.
look out!
goodnight.
i'm not sure. a virus --
she was kind to me. she told me i was beautiful.
a lathe??? get off the line, guy.'
what's definitive, is that i just lost two people in berlin!
it's your call.
no. i was just researching. calm down.
so avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  a man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  don't use very sad, use morose.  language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  it also won't do in your essays.
yeah.
yeah, dad.
aren’t you curious to know about friedman?
how could i forget. mammoth--go pet the kitty.
it's the lawyers.  the lawyers are finally killing me.
that was read at my parents' wedding.
just an hour?  you should tell this stud to take more time.
my partner is dead!  because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
we were going to do it.
stop beatin', man. you ain't doin' nobody no good.
there is no such thing as magic.
gracious even in defeat. how vaguely disappointing. when all this could have been ours together.
i didn't get to see what's on the disks but i can guess. do you want to hear my terms or not.
the -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
i have to go, adam's tormenting zoe, i'll talk to you later. are you going to be ok?
i'm fine.  what's up?
originally, connecticut.
oh yes! in muncie!
so long, freddy. don't take any wooden nickles.
i've got the forensics fella coming down from the rangers. no way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
this week anyhow.
no, sir.
they have these little sticks, vince. they call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
what?
it's in the area of narcotics, mr. reynard, that the government tramples on the fourth amendment.
i'm leaning toward no.
you're a reluctant traveller, then.
i'm going to florida.
that one's for you.
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait don't tell me ... naked sexual charisma?
don't go, susan.
good bye.
i doubt it.  this thief... it very unusual...
what's this all about?
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up. i'm a little concerned.
a companion. a female. like me, so she won't hate me.
yes.
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
easy for you to say.
are you happy?
did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
no offense.
you bet i do.  high tide comes right up to this road.
show you right on a map.
very well. what is it you're proposing, mister mcmurphy?
maybe you should sleep with the judge too. then we can win the case.
it's yours.
i agree, majesty, but i'm afraid it's not possible. the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop.
right.
i'm warning you, don't tempt me.
hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. you don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
[don't jerk a jerk-off. there's nothing in the bureau mainframe.]
yes.
what?
that's really sweet, ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
a thank-you?  for what?  you're the one we should be thanking.
i know a way.
there's plenty of fruit.
you must travel a lot, huh?
get out. get out of here, goddammit.
it's a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for.
i'm going to the chinks.  you're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
no you weren't.
are you okay?
i don't gamble.
and he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great admirer of your work..."
right here, why not? i prayed in saloons, i prayed in the street, i prayed an the toilet. he don't care where, what he wants is that prayer.
ok. one of those. do you have ram rod? the magazine, ram rod?
m'hm.
they said a hundred thirty-fifth and twelfth.
i wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on mr. lounds. i admired it enormously. what a cunning boy you are, will.
i asked you a question, lothar!
yes.
yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. wait until it happens to you sometime.
santos...
that's the loch ness monster.  and... kay-- that's... 444-eyes?
you scare me, charlie.
they believe in the 'tulip.'
shut your hole, slutnik.
shampoo, got it!
and i wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and i want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
don't be.  i'm going.  where we all go.  now how can that be bad.
so are dogs.
you didn't answer my first question. for whom?
the sheets...
as i've missed you.  sleep well, child.
professor, you guys gotta see this. dwight, come here.
if we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
you do.
maybe i died already.  look at my face.
well, it's a new experience for me.  good on curves. shall i take you home, harold?
theoretically.
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  it often bothered him.  so i looked for it and i found it.  gimme.
why?  because i don't like the way you toy with human lives? - your contempt and malice?  because i won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled susie...?  you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, mr. hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
i'm going in there.
you're playing a piano, miss starling?
i am not john wayne.  there is no "s" on his chest.  we get down if the play calls for it.  but we are into business and making money.
no, he's really evil.
i suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. probably not too many men fit that bill.
about what?
i'm so cold.
i'm used to it.  not everyone likes music.
shut the fuck up.
yes.
i'll keep streaking. pick me up.
hi.
no, she said she had a son.  in a dream she once called life.
why?
i had to see bobby. i know you really don't like bobby, but there was a problem and i didn't think you would understand.
and your folks didn't understand?
i want that money. if you wanna tell me something, fine--
here we go.
dartmouth?!
you americans! you are the craziest people! that's why i like you! i wish i could invite you all to my house for a nice german christmas!
i've just been inside the mind of a genius.  lord cornwallis knows more about war than i could in a dozen lifetimes.
it's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
pete, if j. edgar hoover walked in here wearing a dress, i wouldn't know him.
are you kidding, i never miss a party. police chief rasch, my wife emilie.
thanks, no. i despise any form of exercise.  don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
change?  you want my change?  i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change?
oh, my god, he's a natural.
dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
just move with me. don't think.
really.  well, that makes two of us.
i don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
they had sabra and shattila.
we have a renew-your-subscription offer...
i'll always remember it. if i hadn't remembered it, i wouldn't have divorced you.
you will know.  when you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense.  never for attack.
erin?  what are you --
it's quite nutritious, sir.
i do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why i've put them through what i did... the public airing of that... the testament to why i did what i did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
you wouldn't be going in with the troops.  i can guarantee your safety.
so do i.  sort of.
i...i'm-i'm-i'm-i'm sorry.  i have to talk to you for... there's so much that i want to tell you.
i wouldn't be trying, beloved. i would hang him! and another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months. doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
who's this.
good.
crank her!
just the same, i want one.
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
leave him. someone's going to find him eventually. then they'll start looking for us, too.
nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
indeed you did.  and now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
no complaints.
nope. she did.  like i say.  it never panned.
all right.  you see that guy over there?  his name is sport. go talk to him. i'll wait here.
well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. you'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. super string theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms--
what?
a sense of proportion.
you heard me, nad breath. my time's precious and i think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
i was hoping sid and i could talk.
it?  who does?
exactly.  so what do you say?  maybe it's time to give a little something back.
there are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
god!  unbelievable.  vampires.
thank you, bobby. a big score?
your good friend leo fast elk.
i've been privileged to provide services for people i admire.
you don't like it, do you.  i think she will accept, but i'm not sure. she may be too dependent on her brother.
i'm sorry, i...
that's a fine-looking ring.
no, i haven't.
you think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape. how did you do that?
naturally.
i like plaits.
he's running us 'round in circles. look for yourself. look!
we have free will and intelligence -- which god allegedly gave us....
hi.  maya's in the kitchen.
i've never met anyone like you, betty.
you've been listening to rumors.
where?
you do?
you shut down your sensors.
i can't do that.
and you and private graves--
what happened to your eye?
i'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
would this be easier for you in the dark?
and what's steven's status?
tick-tock, tick-tock.
we've only got one suit.
what the hell are you talking about?
i guess you have.
kurtzweil, we think.
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  alfred has been supporting me ever since.
easily spoken...
oh yeah?
that's a good idea.
i'm in the middle of it...
chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays - only twenty hours -
you can believe what you want.  you saw the tape.
don't start no trouble, boy!
who told you this, majesty?
is morpheus alive?
at times. at other times i think she was...more. but who would know that better than you. i mean, you sure 'nough you her.
that's good.
how do you know?
don't you want to know...? i bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
i don't know. why doesn't it?
but there is a bright side though. if you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
mr. president, have i permission to bring into this chamber evidence of the response from my state?
really?
good, i believe you already know my, uh, son --
man, you must be plumb outa your mind! you'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
i understand.
what's the matter?!
okay, what happened?
what?
what do you know about conrad?
no. i'll drive myself. i have a few errands. i'll meet you there.
that's deep.  but before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
i could never move - i've got too much stuff.
then where's it coming from?
why not?
it could.  but the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
what...what about your script?  so what's it about?
there are some people i'd like you to meet.  can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock?
and when he looks up? what does he dream about?
the sun! that's it!
glad to hear it.  tell poor mr larson to come through, will you?
it's okay.
can i come in?
i know. i get it. what's matthew doin'?
why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when i went up.
i guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
gladly...  ... the safe is in mr. jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
no, i can't say that i ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on tv?
are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? we have some very nice canaries this week.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? what's this guy's name?
father said witches live there.
greased lightning!  why do i listen to you? i ought to have my head examined!
i'll invite you again, but your mother thinks i'm crazy.
you know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about miss kubelik, i thought i'd better get rid of it quick -- so i threw it out the window of the commuter train.
listen, it's late already when i realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and sal.  i couldn't get a baby sitter.
big man!
this is claudia, anna's friend...  you've never met my husband, have you?
you can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
it's will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
you know why, don't you? because i am patient, chain-smoking lillian.
not even when it meant something.  is that one night up in flatbed?
the deal.
we've always been here.
i don't know. you tell me?
step... mother.
it doesn't make sense.  who would want to do that to you?
what are you talking about?
no, i'm not...
what do we do? get some help? radio in?
what are what?
when you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
and digging in.  look at that flower bed.
he knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
i-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
jimmy? ruiz. pick up maxie's guineas at luna and bring them to spa.  jimmy's bringing the car around. me and ho rode sleds. we'll meet you at spa in the vip room.
that's insane. you're ahead of your time.
thank you -- b-b-but i'd really like t-t-to--
not that.  us.
hi. i'm jimmy.
yes. hi..congratulations. jack lucas. nice to meet you finally. this is anne napolitano, the owner of video spot.
seems like it's my fault, mr. webster.
how could i be?  we learned some magic...
good.  i want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
raise a hand to me and... .
amen to that.
it isn't a hype, shorty. and i meant what i said: join us.
i'd say about two weeks.
what variables?
and you're unhappy.
that was a long time ago.
you seem to know what you’re talking about.
yeah, i know.
i tell you what. you hit me here.  sugar ray hits me here.  i can't tell the difference. i just fight.
what if i answer yes?  will my wish come true?
don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
it was just great.  uh, i was all set...i was set to be bored stiff.
why do you think?
these murders are his masterwork.  his sermon to all of us.  to all us sinners.
mochaccino.  actually, in the spirit of the pact, i do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
how old is he?
who's your daddy!
hey, look!
your spanish is good enough. you certainly look the part.
i beg your pardon --
i don't need to talk to you.
angie, by the time i get clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. by the time i get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. i gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
he told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
i want to book a flight to fiji.
you will after tonight.  bet on it.
from pennsylvania.  p.i. from pa. what are you doing out here?
benjamin franklin, he discovered electricity.
have you gone to the police?
not from forty feet.
well, it seemed to me --
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  so what's my cut?
that's what you want?
nino, please...
there are <u>other</u> explanations! she is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
cause she's dead.
i wasn't singing to myself.
who gives a fuck?! i was just fucking with him!
cigarette?
that's all i get?
hey, rich.
no. but while you was buying the underwear, i could have lifted the socks.
no, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
i can understand that.. but please don't start crying again.
i just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  clear my head.
the fastest.
clear meadows.  that shit's dead.
oklahoma, thelma.  we're crossing into new mexico.
you know, i'd be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
i don't know they just always need it.
i don't care.  he'll never see me or know my name. if we find him, the police will have to take him down. not me, i'm just looking at evidence.
yeah.
and we will begin with tearing it down.
right.
okee-dokee, doggie-daddy.
you mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  you are in a hurry! somebody chasin' you?
good. you're discreet. i like that in a partner.
the water tastes better in the kitchen.
give me a minute, will ya?
i suppose so.
it's not knowing that's so awful, bob. not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
something awful happened last night.
yes you have. you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
looking?  looking?  you've found someone i'd say.  heh?  yes!
we can do this. we can get her out of here.
it doesn't necessarily mean she's...
yes!  it was...it was unforgettable.
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. you are in the business, that's what roki says.
and bill?
just forget about it.
and you're taking?
that's something, jasper.  what is it?
a business meeting, i told you that.
first i need a copy of the key.
we've spent a lot of time discussing those years. remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
great!  but that's the way things go. you think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
what do you mean?  i checked them myself.  i made the calls...
i drove -- i drove mrs. robinson home. she wanted me to drive her home so i -- i drove her home.
i can't.
did it ever bother you?
yeah, i can smell it.
what happened?
no problem, sheriff.
how devilishly clever.
yeah.
they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
they gonna rush us?
it's okay if you are, we just want to know. i don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause i run this street.
no!  no no no!  none of that!  i want this show to be positive!
mrs. brovlofski, the v-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
pack, wladek, there's no time.
well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  i mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  they're like --  -- the mighty oak.  it's not a look.
we'll see who gives in first -- i'll leave my door open.
now, here's a babe!
you were real close to all of them, to adolf, to hermann, to joseph, to baldur, and now albert,  so, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. what was your party number?
fuck kindred spirits. my little puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. if he starts yapping, he's a loser; if puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
not me.  you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
fucking drunk, huh?
...don't get all...
i just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
leeches. a long list of leeches.  it looks good like that.
it's okay.  you...  you thought i was bad.
bring some ice cream, i'm burning up.  do you love me?
these'll keep it cold.
at school. it's thursday.
cut the shit. you shouldn't be in here, man.
you have a fever, sweetie?
issue the toilet paper tear as a...
you don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- i mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
as well as can be expected, i guess. give me the bad news.
people might be better off.  they thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
i don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--i thought you taught the, uh, the--
finest kind. we're training ho-jon to be a bartender. join us?
so, what now?
i don't want to hear that word!
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
someone jumped on your car with their butt...
huh!
it can be dangerous...
what about the bogyman?
entschuldigen sie. it was a terrible thing.
i worry when you get like this.
then don't do it.
bob!
some other time, stevens.
oh, i didn't hear you come in.
why would i do it?
did he say what about?
that viper has envenomed the water. no animal will drink here now.
it's alright, isn't it?
message to proteus.
well they can fucking un-post it!
i figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
the hell with him.  we'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
that shit is poison, frank. we don't drink alcohol here. what you need is one of these.
visual --
time for what, edie? time to look into me a little more, that's what. no matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who i am.
no, really, i can cope.  i can handle this lot easily!
i'm good.   really.
no way.
why, sure, ma'am...
him? he, is a she -  at the bar.
ten days ago.
what?
yes.
he told you, didn't he?
mrs. rand.
oh joy of joys!  oh, dream of dreams!  i can't believe it.  birds, birds, do you hear?  otto, bertz, heintz, hans, wolfgang, do you hear?  ve are going to clear the fuhrer's name.  fly, fly, spread the words.
stargher is in custody.  the functional equivalent of being under arrest. normally, we'd mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. but because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
come in.
guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  go figure.
that would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since andrew died.
i thought you were dead... i --
pop, this is important to me.  it's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
i wish i knew, edie, but— 
you did?
you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
i was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
the strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year i'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
you're lucky to get four words out of them in english. but if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate french. those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
who? jed?
he served his time for what he did. another thing... if lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
i don't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing.
pick me up at my father's house at around seven. and don't be late this time.
does that look like an animal hanging?
tell them we're working for the university.
so does half of san diego.
why?
what good is it? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. pretty vague. where do you start looking? maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. but the entire top portion is missing.
first the pets, otis.
watch her. don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
about a year.
let me handle this.
don’t know any doctor jokes.
william simpson.  i like willy.
when was that?
shelby --
if we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
can't survive on our bodies alone, nick.  hurry up!
meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
yes, ma'am. a lot of water under the bridge.
fuck! it broke the skin...
i bet.  thanks for the drink.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
pussy, ass, soft personnel.
didn't you just make one called "bride of the atom"?
no, i want to have this marked, mr. -
i'm serious about this, peter --
so more men were slaughtered uselessly!
i've seen worse.
mm.
confusin' me with johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. i only deal in life and death. all that stuff in between? some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
move! or you die right here!
i won't....
that's very interesting.
i'm listening.
put him in doctor spivey's office!
yes mam... we gotta go, miss boatwright.. .
all right!! all right!! you want to know? you want to know how i feel? i feel ashamed. is that what you wanted to hear?
i'm worried about you.
is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
yes, sir.  i'll talk to helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this watergate thing?  what do i tell ziegler to tell them?
all of it.  as much as you've got.  a couples thousand pounds.  i'll be back in a week with a plane.
uh-huh
let me see.
you want this?
come on, daddy-o. you haven't said a word since we started. least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
take your time.
hey.
fine. you want to help ricky, talk to maxie yourself.
yes.
come on, lovey.
she spoke to me.
i won't be made to feel like i've done something wrong.
well? where the hell are you?
no.
you're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
i'm sorry.  that was impressive. the...  tumbling.
this is <u>bullshit</u>. someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
not right now.
the freighter started through at 1:42.  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.
i beg your pardon.
and if i don't? if i don't you'll come back after your death. you'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. you hate that thought, don't you? that's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
mrs. delaney.  did you hear the latest?
werewolves simply do not exist.
that's what i have to tell you, rafe.  it wasn't a choice.  it --
i guess so. then what happened?
gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
all right, jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
not far from here, south boston.
hello tom. you're off? what are your plans?
i'll remember.
it's called journalism, fletch. it's called getting both sides of the story. something you apparently don't know anything about.
what about giving the other guy a break.
i don't know if i can.  but you have this... and you know where to come.
lemme see...
little baby girl.
-- we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president. i think we've won.
how long is it so far?
how are we going to find him?
mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
no.  should i?
check it out.
i don't know. senior editor? sounds like you're in to me.
jess, c'mon...
bye.
wrenches.  my dad's gonna love that one.
-- tuscarora --
you think so?
you know what i'm gonna do.
what about mrs. marschal?
lisa's an extremely valuable member of the skywire team. we've got our eyes on her. you keep yours on milo.
hi.
why should i believe you?
involved!  christ!  she attached my goddamn paycheck!  child support. why do you think i can't afford a lawyer?  you know what i mean.  why i got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
i always liked the west, west of il- linois anyway. but you gotta give me time to pack.
shelby! we need people out here at cosgrove and mccammon right away!
fucking map quest. <i>never again.</i> <b> ext. downtown garage rooftop -- next </b> ziering and green approach a large tent. the winnebago is parked off to the side. alf is inside... doing something with a welder on the front of the rv.
there's a charming thought.
you shouldn't let him do that to you...
well, er... let's drop it. i don't think you would care for that one.
that's because you can hardly see through those things.
raspberry.
nobody leaves cuervo jones. not unless you give your life. you fight till you're dead. then i forgive you.  understand?  understand?
no i'm not.
nothing...
he told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  now that's all i have.
just who the fuck do you think you are?!  get out!  you're fired!
the front door.  isn't there a back road i can take?
there's another choice.
i guess i ain't.
i know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. what's it like living in a locker?
who's gonna make trouble?  hey, amigo!
very...  so, who you working for these days eric?
then why do you want to leave?
where'm i goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
tomorrow the oil!
i don't know...
what else?
what for?
thirty-six— sev— aah i lost the count.
simple math. when i woke up this morning and saw your smile... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
yeah?
i think you'd feel out of place at my party.  you see, it's for winners.
mr. gardner, i don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
how about you? all right?
you know, there's something we never really thought of...
i mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  goldwater put it right.  he said: "well for christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... it's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  that's the tragedy of all this.  mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. it's time he assumed some responsibility.
i'm sure he's matured since then.
oh-oh-
you're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl.  we get adler and we beat this thing.
this going to work?
who?
fine. but only if we recover the cash.
you know your weapons, buddy.
it's okay. it's okay.
the who?
yes, sir -- i guess i do -- gee --
spock. does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
we're not cops.  we're from massachusettes.  i mean, does he look like a cop?
i'm fine--but thank you.
give me a round figure, mr. scott.
maybe we should back off a bit.
i don't know. american citizens.
bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, i'm busy.
i live with it every minute of every day.
some people got faces that stick in your mind.
don't make fun of me when i'm being wonderful and supportive.  you belong on the court.  just like i belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
gets you where you live, huh?
that's funny.
because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight i was sort of tied up with steve... but tomorrow i figured on doing just that.
cut 'em...
we'll last longer then we will against that death star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
yes. i had thought that... i was loathsome to you. perhaps i am. if i may be excused, m'lord.
no! they will be the judge of that! and so will i... if you shame me!
they told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... in other words, things of that sort.
yes. might as well - all of it.
nobody. i'm the maid!
get back here, rool!
oh yes -- yes. won't take a minute. can you keep a secret?
yes.
no, she was just sitting there?!
fried chicken.  anybody want some?
tom, what do i do now?
lead the way, murman.
a bad climb, no, just another challenge.  what's life without 'em, right, agent travers.
i believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
i'll by that, son.  now, you owe me a favor.  be good to my kid sister...
<u>here</u>?!
i can appeal in five. i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli.
i didn't do it. i didn't do it.
well, what difference does it make where you're sitting?
...elephoned sir.
what other point is -
i've got another one.  warmer.  what will you do when it's all over?
into what?
no, i've been calm all my life!  if i don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
and her lips?
let me out, truman.  you're not right in the head.  you want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
yes.
he's beautiful...
i'm trying to communicate how i feel, jeff. you know raise consciousness. make people think for a change.
gee, i must have been shit-faced at your wedding, i don't --
what would you like to know, sir?
time-warner has a 40 per cent stake in gary's set-top device. that also takes out cnn.  "ge joins outpost in new venture," which means nbc is out. "disney joins outpost," abc is out. "outpost and newscorp in new deal," fox is out. any of these places could have a mole. or all of 'em.  it's like a a continuous loop. we can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something gary's got a finger in!
good for you. protein.
what clip?  what was it?
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
oh dear.
is the thing -- is it over?
yes.
tell me what happened theo.
what a rip-off. come on. we gotta find that chick.
i'm not very good at it.
in a minute.
to be honest, when i'm working, i don't look at faces much. he knew the guy's name.
it might be an interesting case.
hello, anna ahm...  scott -- have some wine.
oh sure.  this girl is a college graduate.
immediately.  is this the daily news? melanie daniels. would you get me the city desk, please?
i got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
yeah, just make sure you do first. let's go, guys.
you gonna talk to him?
you're right. i'll never be as good a liar as you.
if you knew, why didn't you say anything?
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
you'll see!
know what?  know what, goddammit!
he... he's here...
listen to me:  elanora <u>duse</u> was playing hamlet in london in 1905, and royalty could not get a ticket.  she said, "i'm not doing the seven shows a week i signed for."  she said, "i cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  i am an artist. i'll do four shows a week."  the greatest actress of her time.  you know what her producer said?
best speed to vulcan. mr. chekov, take the prisoners below.
i'm saying i didn't sign it!
fuck you! have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
you have no right! you have no fucking right, you bastards! get the hell out of here --
yeah!  and what rim job expert went and outlawed cheesy poofs!?
-- forget it --
he just completely ignores me. he could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
he's mine?
he's on the island, he'll be back on...
there wasn't time?
it's amazing, isn't it? such a gift howard gave the world.
of course, i had my nine-millimeter automatic.
it's time for drastic remedies.
our present.
is there a mrs. dyle?
and making you feel bad at the same time, huh? but that's the way i am, you know, the way i've always been. always picking on poor little roy.
the world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
it's three years old, it --
you want to come?
i would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
those were perfectly good fries, hamilton.  perfectly good.
you ain't going in alone?
yeah.
hey, sid, thanks.
givvem a cigarette...
this is interesting--  why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
gretchen. we're going together now.
thank me publicly?  for what?  for ruining this woman's life?
you're the waterfront specialist. find out about it.  i've got a murder to investigate.
i'm not your folks, man. you love this... susan?
ok. so you were married for how long?
no. absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
captain, if --
not this time.
a humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  if it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
absolutely.
i don't think so, jim...
hey, relax man, i'm a brother shamus.
i mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. i mean. no offense.
trust me on this kate.  i really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
that's right. we don't need no fences, we have the gun line. it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. you are now inside the gun line...
it's all right. i really do know them.
yeah jack, her assistant...
what?
of course, it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
funny. i thought that's exactly what you did. you just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
i know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or i'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
it's not your time. i get time off.
yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
dwayne pinsley?  i'm trying to reach dwayne pinsley.
what's happening?
i was walking past and i saw you in here...
go on. take your bath. i'll beat it.
you!
but it's king westley on the phone.
yes, and just one time can be enough.  thank you.
inspector rock will pay you. in cash. a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
this will do. 
such a vision will be opposed. who seeks it?
the smallest thing i've got.
but, majesty, this is just a frolic. it's a piece about love.
brunello di montalcino, '85, please.
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
sack him?  david, what else can i do?  this business is not, repeat, not breaking even. and david ... notice anything this morning?
i read about it in the paper.
i'll explain everything later.
i'm gonna take clara home. it's close to one.
during my meditation training... i came to a place of deep silence... i was surrounded by light... time and space disappeared.  i had come to a place my master had never told me about.
they're still our friends, annie. it's nothing serious. you kid about them all the time... and i could tell paul really appreciated me being there.
i have to talk. is that okay?
that's right.  c.d.c. found out and closed them down...
who mam?
it's okay.
not in that company.
why?
i don't know it.
wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
how about you?
no. it's never going to stop, period. it won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. it's finished. i'm finished.
just an atmospheric discharge. nothing to be afraid of.
nugent. ted nugent.
we concur, saavik. and saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. i'm getting nervous...
it's the same way with cars. different cars. different tunes. you can't steal a maserati listening to sinatra. you gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that shit. but never, never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car. could lead to disaster. got it... ?
i can't find manolo.
you know, jessica.
"some prophet guy." and a city man. but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god.
done.
i do not state it, sir. the prisoner does.
was it a boyfriend of yours?
hi.  so far so good.  so.  what should we talk about? how insecure we were in high school.  shirley votypka, the first girl i ever felt up. health.  what about health? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
aren't you afraid to leave? you don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
how long have you taken care of him?
how'd they know who you were?
what that?
maybe their whole technology is based on that. controlling water.
but this is different, sir. you're the president.
between six and seven seconds.
at college.
it's burning...
you better take one.  your breath has been a little funky all day.  let me look at you.
and the "triumphant return of dj rob gordon?" "triumphant?" "return?"
why?
but isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
what'd he think it was to you?
i'm terribly sorry.
bug batteries... according to military intelligence, it'll be random and light. drop status ?
huh? oh, okay, i'm sorry.
that's it. they know i'm in here. we've got to find them.
yes...
oh my god oh my god...
it's just fed.  it won't attack unless it's threatened.  don't move.
i tried.
you guess? you mean you don't know?
he's asleep.
you got somethin' against the cap'n?
as i told you about english policemen.
... that was a dr. david gruber's office ...
they'll listen to what we say in here.
a wife.  she left.
i guess i lost:
i'm 53, starling. if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv, i'd still have to retire in two years. it's not a consideration. but you are...  you've done enough. if i keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. cost you six months, at least. i can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  now's your chance, starling. go back to class. leave bill to me.
alicia!  come here, have a seat.  show miss vale why you wear the mask.
was he any good???  he was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
hello.
that chick, erica?
walter can i ask you something?
from you, pard? never. thanks for the graduation present.
i'm a file clerk.
i don't want to be here. don't worry, i love you, daddy, i do. but i want to go home.
i think so too.
...about what?
calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
ugh ...
i wanna report a robbery!
sorry, i should have explained. you see, i have this condition -
why do i feel like the other man, here?
okay, you got it. just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
no.  but i've got something going with ad vice.
grandma death.
yeah, right.  we're not gonna get caught.
you've got the public upset, al.
hey, that's just fuckin' - that's bullshit. you know, you know, what the fuck?
harold, please! i'm on the phone.
you're not going to drive.
who?
have you any place in mind?
came back three days ago.
it’s up to you whether they walk or not.
it will. starting with your own.
what happened to me?
same old daniel.
maybe.  don't mush it.
wait!... wait...
good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  maybe they never would have found you.  day like today you'd be dead for sure.
i ain't no fuckin' kike!
what what? what advantages?
i'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- you've been really sweet.  sleep tight, okay?
...janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
no, the problem, as i recall, was the lack of blocking...
how... when did you...
mr. president!
there are still some boats forward. stay with this one... murdoch. he seems to be quite... practical.
oh my god... what is that?
lord vigo, the mother, dana, is fine and strong.  i was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if i bring the baby, could i have the woman?
yes to me or yes to the coil?
can't it wait, then?
no.  the world has missed you.
you know, people.
i'm sorry .maybe i better go dorothy.
i did.
i was, because if you said "yes" right away, i wouldn't get to say this next part.  and i've been practicing it.  ready?
that's enough.
must be an expressway.... you don't have to stay here, you know....
we've heard from scott, now let's hear from you.
gimme a break!  coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  trust me... they're not speaking russian.
yeah, how so?
i assume a lot of your business is from our people.
didn't you find out anything about the porters?
the acid bath?
i'll never get my washing done.
are you lyin' to me?
well..um...you get an official membership card...  just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... parry?  you want to laminate miss sinclair's card?...
i said, i've seen it before.
what letter?
we're on our way home. i just...we're running a little late.
proceed. but don't turn this hearing into a farce.
well, i always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  how did you know they'd get into the vodka?
i read your report. i had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, tom being nowhere around --
i know where to find him... he lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
i just don't.
sure it's true. i was fighting for my country as well as myself.
that's a pretty brassiere.
when did you start smoking?
reality check, dillweed.  this is 1995.
i'm seeing what a busy man does.
are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
i have to go back to the hotel. i'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. i will see you at suppertime, rose.
don't give up. you're going to make it.
you mean <i'm> going along?
no.  or why you should.
his will.
you can't leave, george.
we sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the state computers, the fbi and interpol. nothing.
now don't do that. don't you do that! don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. that it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! if you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
what happened??!!!?
oh, yes i would. i'd know you any time --
england?
then i'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  go on, now.
you're not goin' anywhere!  get on the fuckin' floor!
when's he coming back...?
i want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
well, congratulations!  you fucking pulled it off!
well, to each his own. so-lunch, thursday? i'll call your secretary about reservations.
cici. who's this?
i wasn't talking about real friends. why doesn't gus like me.
why not? it died?
she went out.  she said she went out to run some errands.  she'll be back.
like what?
don't i always?
she is not my wife.
there's more than one?
come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
i feel sure of it.
no, no--shit no.  excuse me, penelope.
and, what, i'm not serious?
where did you learn that?
i've told you:  i can't afford to garage it.
oh, yeah -- right.
in case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
not such a menace now, is he, pinkerton?
you took bill.
unpack nothing.  i didn't say i was staying.
why?
that's true.
don't talk.  check again.  lie flat and then cut.
no, not anyone else - just me.
money? yeah . . . well, a little.
the land is there.  i know it!
i do. goodbye. 
i'm not from the sea... i don't understand what you're talking about.
emily -

oh. it never crossed my mind.
i'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
no!  they're right here --
sweep the harbor.

pumpkin?

oh. i see.
it was nobody. ah... he's a poll, taker. i'm thinking of voting democrat this year. but don't mention it to your father. how was school today?

you father was seduced by the dark side of the force. he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader. when that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. so what i have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
come on, you brought it up. do you know anything?
sometimes, sure.
you redneck idiot, do you have...
you should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. mauve.  so what's your name?
i want to know... if he's doin' all right. if he's okay.
if you were tore up i would not be claiming you.  trust.
it's not a prison, it's a hospital. there's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
isn't that special?  patrick?
<u>liza</u>!
who the fuck is he?
yeah -- and lednov's only lookin' for one man. me.
i didn't shoot him when he was a man. i shot him when he was-
a big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
okay, santa claus. 2000 lunches.

so have i--i can get it right out of my trunk.
shall i leave, m'lord?
well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! now i don't know if i can make it down to 155. i'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if i don't make 155, i forfeit $15,000! you're supposed to know what you're doin'. you're supposed to be a manager!
yes.
what?! are they going to kill me? is that what they're going to do?!
fire the rockets!
some deal you did there!
oh god, doug.

let's hope so. sally if he asks me again, i'm gonna tell him i returned it all.
oh, hi.  i'm an old high school buddy of dwayne's.  i was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. but i've gotta catch a plane so i'm afraid i'm not gonna be able to make it.
yes.
nothing.
the jockey!
tell eve? you mean mrs. rand?
why?
think about it. you walk into a video store and you see eight-minute abs and right next to it you see seven- minute abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
resting up?  sorry spooky, i've got to go with god on this one. i hate to think we're just in this for the money.  garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. we're going out of oasisburg on a win.
he's pretty laid back, confident.
possibly. split personality ...
it's <u>not</u> stupid.  we're ghosts. do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  moan louder!
i know.  it was a joke.
why does god let us get tired?
i suppose you could say that.
seating problems.
don't say please, fuckhead. what are these?
come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
i understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. they are willing to pay any price! they have a circulation of two million!
are you vice?
yeah.
clark, i think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
where is elaine?
no problem. oh, boy!
look jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
will that be on the midterm?
don't feel that way, honey.
the other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
alexander, i know you're trying to help.  but they don't come back.
he didn't give you much choice.
this has nothing to do with walter.
we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
what?  gimme a fucking break.  is that what you think?  that your not big enough a deal for me?  jesus, gimme a little credit, rob.
oh--
too bad.  besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
thank you. are you well today, fraulein lorl?
i think maybe i have more options than i thought.
what's uncanny?
what did you say?
so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london.
maybe that's my problem.
the airport... no, look out, short round! left, left!
what?
ahh, i hate this town! places like this just make you small...  i should have never come back here after college.
who tells you these things?
excuse me, mister... i'm looking for mister rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and i got lost...
beautiful.
well, i try to keep an open mind, but...
how much do you know?
commander riker, evasive maneuvers!
we want to meet him.
about fifty grand.  i won it at the tables.
it's something they have on earth. you know, where your cousin went.
is this your new dress suit?
he was quite a man.  did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
and you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
better start gettin' into your clothes.
what music?  there ain't no music.
... or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
my life's an open book. you read?
you have to! quickly!
what?
oh thank buddha it's you, kim-lo, i'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
no kiddin'?
yep.
don't give me the musketeers!  how'm i going to keep the guy ashore?
andy, the theater's that way!
sort of.
yeah, but it was okay.
caesar, this is corky.  corky, caesar.
all right, then, and we'll be off.  nice chatting with you.
don't worry, mom.  i know all about cannabilism, i saw it on t.v.
i'm... i'm not the king...
who the hell knows?  everyone's giving orders.  it's all very democratic.
what weapons do you have?
you can change.
perhaps... but wherever he comes from, i think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
altitude fifty kilometers...
you're welcome, truman.
bullshit! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
let me ask you something... you really think i'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? i'll get square with your boss. i'll get square with whoever did al. i'll get square with everybody. then i'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
my hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
not this week. this week he's flyfishing at the oughterard slough in county kildare, with one of our best irish guides.
he is?
i don't remember.
but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
all stop, sir.
uh huh.
you do everything your parents tell you?
instruments fluctuating, captain. patterns unrecognizable.
seen one like it before?
aye-aye sir. engines to half.
all right.
richie said he was coming after me tonight.
hmm... mike and ike's.
because your problem is you're bored. and you have a very big mind.  i am part of what i call a brain syndicate.
you said somebody... who?
no. i should go.
honest?
find out who they are?
i did not.
no, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
in a storage facility.
don't stand there talking!  put me together! we've got to find dorothy!
jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
i want you back too, viktor.
did you hide the letters?
phasers locked...
i just came out to say goodbye.
that he is.
ridiculous!
you're not my father!
uh huh. yeah. forget it.
her fucking body fell out!
give me a break, will you. how often do i ask you for something?
him.
it's okay.  i have my senior lifesaving card.
yeah, unhappy and fat.  and i still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
that room!
okay. let's get serious. of course i know the cult of good is not good. ever since i saw what they did in atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. i've followed them to oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. that computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. this isn't just a story, selina--another damn pulitzer--this is my life.
it'll be wonderful! i'll show you my old stomping grounds!
phreak and joey are being framed. we need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
... i'm grateful to you, chauncey... i would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... but you're so strong - i can trust myself with you. i'm glad, chauncey - i'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
i want to give you something. will you let me?
i see. hank brought them all. that's all right. we'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. how's that?
hi.
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
why not?  mmm?
my mate has been acting very strange.  i can't explain it.....but.  i haven't been feeling very well myself.  i don't know, maybe it's me.  i needed an sp9 last night.  i feel as if something odd were happening to me. something....
very well. first of all, i'll have them search the waters around the island. i brought two frogmen with me... meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
yes, nurse.
don't try to be a policeman, old man.
that is why you fail.
you can learn from books.
alright, let's take a vote...
-- the nazi he knifed?
i don't plan on dying.
i can't.
i didn't know sir.
i was the next man.
you two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
what?
i dunno ... i keep thinking about him.
no...
can't we call someone? admiral lazarro?
i like my work.
50 k don't get you to first base in the big apple, dad, not any more. i pay 40% in taxes, i got a rent of 15,000, i got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, i need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
oh, come, you don't need that.
have you ever speculated, mister harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
epps!
yes. john wants it.
not if you don't want me to.
realize?
hello, neo.  do you know who this is?
age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. you know, each time you westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
no.
keep firing!
like... us?
talk to her yourself...
i dabble.  may i?
how do you know that?
you believe that? yeah, well, i guess you have to trust him.  i'd have second thoughts on that, but then i know 'em.
our daughter.
-- mulder! get in the car!
-- richard.
no, the milk comes when the baby comes.
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this.
your bellmoth case. the fbi thinks there might be mob ties.
you can come and live again in the big house if you want. now that i'm alone, i can settle down anywhere.
i see.  then may be you're safe as long as you only play bach.  he's german. kip is looking around the piano. hana giggles.
it's still sick.
what an odd question!
hal's signalling he's ok.
hello, martin.
but you like that in a man?
i'm sorry.
tom. how's it going?
not my mouth.  our mouth.
i think so. i think that's one of the clues. it's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
they must have clobbered some of our cities already!
no!
it's money.  people use it to purchase goods and services.
lloyd. i never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
well, you get your mind right.  i'm a catholic and i don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  unnastand?!?
who the hell is lucy delaney?
that's astonishing. sera, look...
animal! animal! wake up!
my dog, archie... i woke up with flea bites... creepy. i ran out and bought flea collars. they work really well.
right up ahead, buddy --
fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman, the boy.  i am now a man.
"i sound like an idiot watching the parade i know there's no tomorrow only the charade i am dead deep inside my head all the lies there's no then only now i will love show me how"
this wasn't my idea.
no i'm not, you mother-fucker!
if you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
maybe you should tell me your dream.
i'm serious. it was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. he was a rightie, so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand. just to see what'd come out.
that's right, baxter.
rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but i don't think so.
i think you know. the timetable has been set. it will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. the president will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency. fema, agent mulder. the secret government.
just slow down.  let me get to know you again.  let me get to know this place again.
i love you.
boy.
yes, sir.
we're nearly there, lucilla.
don't tell me my business!  quarter-mile, that way. full throttle.
don't they have to be?...
okay. anyone else have any questions?
she's keeping his name. and one of his planes. and all seven of his children
he's asleep.
and shut up.
i came on a bus.
it's up.  love gives you wings. you can fly away from here.
i am not permitted to speak of such things.
hello, dorothy. 
what is it, starck?
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster. he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
the dorms are only fifty feet away.  you could practically see into my window.  so, what difference does it make?
i was on the 'dukes of hazzard' set about eight years ago.
okay. maybe tomorrow.
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
me?
perhaps. 
i don't believe this.
sure. it's fine.
who is he, pop?
you wanted to tussle, we tussled.
folks, i've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
what am i supposed to do?  call him for cheating better than me?
yoo hoo, bomb...
can't remember?... what do you mean?
like what?
well... how you feel all right about telling liz to put him down...
i can't think of any.
even your own wife, numa.  any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
tsch, what'd the doctor say?
tolerable, i reckon.
the longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, mr. president.
yeah, i know. it's great!
and what are they, pray tell?
there were more then.
you're asking for my documents?
i don't understand what you mean.
i'll be back before you can say souffle.
everything's all right?  you okay?
i don't want anyone else ever to have you.
you will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  only four forms are shown.  after that the pattern repeats.
i got to write my report first.
how's that?
oh...i can't. business.
tucker hasn't penned ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
so what's up?
enough with the stupid voices.
they'll look for you.
it's not my money.  the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  go be a race car driver.  go run for president.  whatever.
c'mon, i wouldn't have a destiny without you. my destiny would be dying at 20. from eating --
i'm sorry. i was in jail once.  i accidentally burned down this house. it was abandoned. i got held back in school again. can't drive until i'm eighteen.  i think when i grow up i want to be a painter. or maybe a writer or maybe both. then i'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. you know, change things.
he asked me to see were you all right.
i'll try not to remember to warn evelyn.
if we make a mistake., he'll burn us. you make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
who we gonna beat?
is he dead?
no, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
compared to me she is.  how come you're not at the cash anymore?  they catch ya steal- ing?
do you?
we'll cover your escape!
i didn't see nothin'.
no.
ok, bye, bye.
i'm just not the type. besides, i want to get out of here.
well, let's see... first of all, you fuck pigs.
come on...
but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus.  i'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
well.  he doesn't think it's god, but for different reasons than me. he's thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop, than i am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be god.
miss wollsten!
i always listen to my feelings....
try a long walk.
carl smith.
promise me again...
they're nines.
look, goddamnit, i never asked you for a goddamn thing! i've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. after mom divorced you, did i ask you for anything? when i wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? no, it was always "ok", "no problem", "you're a busy guy, i understand". the whole time you were a drunk, did i ever point my finger at you and talk shit? no! everybody else did. i never did. you see, i know that you're just a bad parent. you're not really very good at it. but i know you love me. i'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. if i didn't really need it i wouldn't ask. and if you say no, don't worry about it. i'm gone. no problems.
you got it, dad.  i'll call you if i have a problem.
irish m--what the fuck are you talking about?  my name's da fino!  i'm a private snoop!  like you, man!
is he coming?
yes, thomas - i understand.
couple of months anyway.
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room.
we're moving' on. i have to pick up the supplies. just two little boxes.
why are you doing this?
susan, it seems to me -
"o, no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
that's right, preacher. i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and i promised myself i'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
i wasn't going to say --
what the hell do you think's the matter.  i could wait for you someplace.
let's do it.
i've got a boyfriend, mark.
it was only a scratch. far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
there is more in the diary than just the map.
it was amazing.
charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... i mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
honestly, it's a little old hat. they don't want that any more.
boy, that mickey spillane, boy he can write.
comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. michael seems to pull inside himself. cool.  aloof.
sorry. nothing.  see you - i'm going to be late.
he's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
you got a c-plus?  i can't believe i cheated off you.
it's okay, it's okay.
what? the dead guy?  she'll get over fucking the dead guy. shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; i call him dad.
no.  he didn't say what his name was. only that you were expecting him.
yeah, i know.
yeah.  but all things being equal, i'd rather be in philadelphia.  by the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
fron kon steen!
that's a big book you're writing.
did that hurt?
oh, him. well, he died.
he's at a home out here.
no.
it does?  what?
oh.
maybe there's a larger truth.
i didn't mean to insult you. you're an artist.
ah, negative drop.
kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser.
...what?
what do you mean, poetry?
oh, honey. i'm so sorry. but you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. believe me. go to him. don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. and if you need anyone to cry on, you know where i am.
what's going on, bandit? come on.
...well, i've got a large family.
hello, mom?
he set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
i saw you sitting over here. by yourself. i thought, thank god, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
and my hair...what color hair did barbara have?
who else you been to see?
fuck you.
i don't think that's a good idea.
hey, i'm proud of you, kid.
i'll call you later.
frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
maybe the circuit is busy?
you think it's silly. but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
the garden.  take him there.  move, people.  let's do this!
look, marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
what?
by the book...
yes... i... yes.
what are you asking me?
no. ours was damaged.
that sudden?
why not break it up yourself?  you could do it in two minutes flat.
you don't like the way things are, i don't like the way things
what expenses? all you need is carfare to long island. you'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
everytime i get close to you i see my mom. i know it doesn't make sense.
nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
the poem?... the poem was great!
do you think i simulated what happened between us?
i beg your pardon.  li mu bai and i aren't cowards.
marooned on ceti alpha v. he's completely mad, admiral. he blames you for the death of his wife...
we will be ready, lord.
okay. marge, see you tomorrow.  it's really good to meet you.
don't you know? because i got my own ideas.  let's have that civilian stuff.
call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
i'd like to talk to you.  your boyfriend let me in, i just knocked on the door --
they've got quaid!  they're protecting him!
my folks are.
no.
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
come, we have a boat waiting.
believe me, i'm trying to get this over with as fast as i can. but samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
you shouldn't always take me seriously. actually, i'm used to it by now. first my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
i was hoping i wouldn't have to tell you.  dorothy is really my daughter.  you see, it was spring in venice, and i was so young.  i didn't know what i was doing.  we were all like that on my father's side.
how 'bout the key?
it's not a mixer.  it's the senior dance.  and it's important.  you wouldn't understand.
obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
she's dead.
you need to know a lot of shit, vincent.
it was covered with mr. fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
you mean that was a...
what?
shit... shit... what shit?
you cannot, wessex will kill you
that's all right.
i'm great, good, content.  what happened to your arm, roy?
no.
get rid of them.
are you sure?
i'm not painting the fu --, i'm not painting the ashtray. and frogs aren't purple.
now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
it costs.
whoever took it does.
please.
i'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
0150.
no. i can't take that chance. i'd rather kill myself.
sure thing.
but mom, i can't find him!
the ottos always waited for the bus with bear.  they were the only parents who did that, together like that.  i guess they're what you might call hippies.
i'm not like you.
i'm happy, miss flaemm.
i am a lover. in africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
mhravitch.
i wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and i panicked.
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
the barman?  i thought he was called rick?
i just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
i really ought to be getting home. my family will be flipping by now.
i need an extension for my case.
who don't work?  let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  no elevator either and shit.
yeah, i do. a helluva lot more than i trust you.
almost! i'll still bet i'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
now i can't breathe.
i never carry...baggage.
that's impossible.
you wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. i've had my people put together a talent pool. i downloaded it to your desktop.
now, dr. towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  in your opinion is his estimate correct?
she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the doctors.
you fuckin' rule!
even if i'm dying -- i still need clean socks.
out front? you home, baby? i got a surprise for you.
how's that, sid?
...of kittens...
i want to talk to you, pierce.
a good hour. yeah.
where have you been?
luke!
why, i love my father because - because i do. of course, he's nice to me.
put something on. you're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
yes.
no, jeff--please--!
uh-huh.
you'll be deported.
nice try, mulder.
no...i wanna go! i wanna go now!
you have something in mind?
what about before that?
did she believe you?
well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
you're under arrest.
yes sir.
probably to spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
because the past is immutable. frozen.  dead... and you are the past.
so where are we going, princess?
the second note to wake the gods...
i'll tell you what .... you tell me what and i'll do it for. i'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
what are you going to do?
no.
you know what he's like. he just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
fine.
it's all set. my guy in miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  are you sure you don't want to go in with me? five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. a consortium of court street lawyers and judges. they're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars.
yes i did...
what if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does.
hold on, coop...
scott, don't say that...
he ever accept cash for a favor?
'kay, mac!
yes. and now that i've shown you that i know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for jacqueline?
everybody's life's got static. is your life perfect?
chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago... he talks crazy but i brought him along...says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
i don't know.  i think it does.  you know, catherine... if you ever want to talk about it.  what happened to stargher.  that last time.
scarred for life, that's how i am!
immigration's gonna love you for that.
how will it?
you've just made a war that you cannot afford.
oh.
what?
huh? no, alright. well, you know what we need? a hot cop of coffee. hand on. ohh, hey, i was up all night too, man. a long, long, long night.
no, not yet.
this place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
the problem is i have no idea who i'm talking to right now.
you understand what you'll be doing?
don't matter.  they're all the same: dead weight.  can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  make my skin crawl!
it's the lapd, can you open the door, please?
bluebell came in?
we'll see you next week, and if--
wait till i tell you what it is.
for cathy. for her birthday. by the way, where is she?
...what...?
a beach named x? that i'd like to see.
please.  they show previews for foreign movies.
please stop now.
yes, true. but on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...no, lara, believe me; earth is the least of evils. on earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. but with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  he will be fast, he will be virtually invulnerable.
you saw that on t.v., cole?
she left.  she's gone.
but, joe - three weeks in florida!  we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
i'd like to know what...
of course you have a case! now, i want you to go with my assistant, iris, and fill out some forms. she'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  mrs. finley? any back pain since the accident? dizziness? nightmares?
after all, this is a conservative firm -- i don't want people to think i'm an entertainer --
about forever.
you're going too?
i'll be at the bridge.
what do you get for winning?
you mean -- worried about my testimony?
he's the only one i told.
our common heritage.  i am your only real friend, you know.  the only one who truly understands you.  i look forward to the day we meet again.  and i kill you.
what happened?
there's something i didn't have time to tell you before.
then who are you?
except fall down like a normal person.
look at his face, he did the deed.
burbage says you have a play.
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
share the love, tits!
he just came up screaming.
what about everything i said to you this afternoon...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
yeah, screw 'em, huh? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
nothing we can do, man.
you wanted me to be your son.
alright!  that's it!
what?
i call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
i'm worried about him, he's worried about me, i ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like i'm not supposed to know he's there.  now it's christmas, and you know what happens to people at christmas.
i know. it was perfect. [beat] erase my sanity and you erase anything i'll ever say.
well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
don't lie to me, hamilton!  if i had not court-martialed arnold...
who?
it won't hold!
always.
hello...  yes...  no, not yet... all right...  goodbye.  that was for you again.  he wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
really?
we can't stay here.  even if that wasn't an iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
yes'm.
we're getting married. she said she could tell i was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
<i>                      -- it's a bat. --              will it bend? -- it's a rat. --              will it break? -- perhaps it's the head that i found in the lake.</i>
and too many of them are produced.
absolutely.  the church even sent me an autographed picture of god.  ward!
yeah, why?
commes des garcon.
looking for maggie.
since i was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? okay, doll?
that's her pussy talkin' --he gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  he winks at her.  the woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
excuse me.
no. every time i wake up somewhere different. sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge.
you're not.
it's that jerk walter.
go right ahead.
that's just why i'm going.
is it for a child?
they were both poisoned. i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
and if it so happens that you're wrong? if it just so happens that i could care less about you?
okay.
i've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. i want to take him to the ship.
why?
peter redmond. they found out why he can't remember his lines. there's something living in his brain. a parasite he picked up in borneo, doing the movie.
are you all right?
what the hell are you talking about?
all i need is the radio frequency to track them.
oh, of course.
please, i insist.
done. no matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or i should say, two.
ah, c'mere. i want to show you something.
often.
you'll wait till you rot!
maybe two, three months after juarez. i was visitin' my cousin, junior train, in savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. a girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
clear as day.
what kind of life have you got here? scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
ben, the money's not important. we could save lives.
yes sir. you've got the mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the journal --
i am not...a guerilla fighter, toby. i'm not a pioneer. i'm not...i'm not strong that way. i need...
we lost 'em.
who's to say he ever will?  he's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- in fact, i'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
wait, i know him --okay?
he didn't used to be cheap. he thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
starla, it ain't --
i've read up on it. i'll deliver the baby myself if i have to.
they're glass. the buttons.
wait a minute.  i had some licorice ice cream earlier.  you guys could be gas.  what if... i'm dreaming. can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
oh, i'm almost back - i'm driving around moose lake.
that's fuckin' combat.  the man in the black pyjamas, dude.  worthy fuckin' adversary.
i said calm down and shut the fuck up. what's your problem?
who told you to wear men's clothes?
yes.
football wasn't the kind of life i wanted... for ten years i'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. and if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. i've seen way too much of it in my job... i can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  i don't hate the game. i admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, i was in awe of how he could play it, but i couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. and it always does with that game.  it's not a thing many people would understand.
we need light in here, stat.
maybe he ain't so tough.
i hope he got his mother's permission.
okay.
...su-per du-per. come let's mix where rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
what about you, delly?
now learn something about yourself.
thanks again for your help!
i wish these people would leave already. i can't listen to another story. did you see him?  that doctor says the brain is coming around. they're waiting for the heart to stabilize. i don't know who to believe. he says they still have to keep him tied up.
banzai.
but, david.
i hate this city.
yes.
i don't know if --
it's the same thing. goodbye, dear.
you think so?
right.
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
perseverance.
i'd get over there, terry. i'll take the little lady home.
oh yeah... i'm gonna save you.
dad...  i'll pay you back for all this, i promise.
it is a disgusting habit, bertie.  it should be discouraged.
sure, claire. if you don't mind walking my way.
no ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
when's your birthday?
not the point.
alright, i love you too. go to sleep.
for whoever's in that thing.
could you take it just a little easy, mr. udall?
no. i couldn't.
...that's not what i meant.
was it a teddy?
i'm am architect.  i'm working on a site back in --
dieter asked where i was. he expected me here. maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
how much.
don't brag now,  jonathan.
he never told me.
what about basil? where's my snake?
hang on.
nowhere. [beat] i just think i'm gonna be sick.
...what was that?
how about these?
he had the detonators!  theo?  theo!
ah, it's just old, like me. you don't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints...i say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. but, 'long as we're here...
no. i'm serious about this.
i think i should go home.
got it.  nice touch.  okay, pick me up at eight.  the de-brief is at ten hundred.
just a girl.
no.
see for yourself, federal agent, u.s. treasury.  on the job.
don't i know you?
they're in the sub, sir.  waiting.
we know what it is, al.
well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  you do for each other. and other people's rules don't mean shit.  it's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  understand?  okay.  well, my friend and partner was shot last night and i'm after the shitbag that did it.  as my partner, i'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
to see ya train.
no. no. no. hey, that painting in there...  i just want to tell you...
what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?
see, men always do this.  "quiet down, honey.  chill out.  take a valium". i'm not a fucking idiot, nick!  i did not imagine it!!!
shhh. shhhhh.
no, but i thought that didn't happen in italy, that each region was completely separate! i was sure that was the --
what did she say?
funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- i ran into your secretary -- miss olsen. you know -- ring-a-ding-ding? i laughed so much i like to died.
i'll take a bus.
sir, heat shields at maximum!

what?
sheesh!  aye aye cap'n!
what?... oh yes... shovel... create ... verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... iliad... just sit down for a minute.
he's pretty young for that job.
very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from moscow? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
... yes?
i said i saw you last night. what were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
yah, i'm down in the twin cities and i was just watching on tv about these shootings up in brainerd, and i saw you on the news there.
carpe diem... seize the day.
recite the lord's prayer.
you going with patrick?
thanks, handyman.
sometimes. a little. only it ain't scairt so much. it's just waitin' an' wonderin'. but when sump'n happens that i got to do sump'n--  --i'll do it.
or even spirit messages from the next world.
good... pass the beer.
don't you know?
they certainly don't waste much time.
oh.  oh, that's a good one.
what pictures?
let's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly? or careers... clue... snakes and ladders?
ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. you and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. now i'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
margo, as you know, i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith. i have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. you were one. jeanne eagels another... paula wessely... hayes - there are others, three or four. eve harrington will be among them...
you're breaking up with me?!  i thought you were proposing.
frankly - yes.
thanks.  what's in there?
i did.
you can use my car.
relax, roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
make that two.
so i should feel happy that he got away with it?
after all that i've done for that fuck! and he wants to be with that slut? fine! he can have his slut!
you're certain?
zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. they'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
death is a very light thing for you.
where are you dewey?
i thought as much.
it's just that i'm very worried about madame.
believe me, i don't blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
he said you were smart.  he also said you were competing with your dead father.  how did he put it? trying to measure up to a ghost.
yeah, that's the story of my life.
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
you? volunteer? i don't think so.
'cause i'm a new york cop who used to be a new york kid, and i got six months backlog of new york scumbags i'm still trying to put behind bars. i don't just get up and move.
i'm not like wes.  wes was crazy.
a wig?
i'm sorry sir. i believe the flight is closed.
the cretaceous.
gus, if there's anything i hate, it's greed.
scared of oswald, are you?  why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
but we are underground?
oswald was an assassin.  you're not an assassin, are you, jerry?
i wonder...what...was it all...for...
no, silly. forget it. i'll make them. thanks.
what the hell for, man?
...it's -- milo, isn't it?
i was working with a boy named eugene.
it's a rave!  boy, if i ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
stealing his arms?
how long till the drug wears off ?
we're here now.  let's get her done.
in jail.
acceleration is no longer a constant.
sh, sh! fuck you!
i will.
don't be so glum, hawk. the night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
you first, edvard.
fucking sweet.
what?
no, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. she thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
you'd die for fun?
deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
this one could save your life.
so why did you leave?
you said speak czech!
does that surprise you?  it was inevitable.
why d'you come out with me? you slummin' or something?
aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
no.  look, forget it.  i don't want to talk about it.
oh god, oh god no.
dr. grant!  dr. grant!
there's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
ma. if i'd won, i'd know about it. someone would have notified me.
burke. you won't believe it. he's showing cognitive signs. he started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. had to sedate him. he's in a cat scan. i'm giving him every test i can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
exactly.
anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
what do you do best?
and where you goin'?
you've been watching the film.
what?
"...of perpetual distances."  everybody's checking their shoelaces. pins drop.  "i'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  i say...
now, my diminutive friend, what can i do for you?
but why did you want to?
why not?
rather what?
that's vaughan. he talked to you at the hospital.
patch him through....
what other job you got?
the <u>kobayashi maru</u>, sir.
you're unemployed, alfie.  boss is dead.  her plan is over.
oh, just so.
hide the car.
do you expect me to believe that?
but after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
you mean like career?  uh, i don't know.  i've, i've thought about this quite a bit sir, and i'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, i don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  i don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career i don't want to do that.  so, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but i can't work for that corporation, so what i've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but i think it's got a good future.  as far as career longevity goes, i don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but i can't really tell if i'm great until i've had a couple of pro fights. but i haven't been knocked out yet.  i don't know, i can't figure it all out tonight sir, i'm going to hang with your daughter.
he coulda been white.
thanks.
five ten. brown eyes. but you're no pinup.
may as well go out under my own free will, right?
not really. i know how competitive it all is --
vegas!  can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
fine.
when i want your advise, keegan, i'll make an appointment.
hey you two. lights out.
to exchange our thoughts - what does a russian know about business? on the other hand, what does an american know about diplomacy?
the name is josephine.  and it was your idea in the first place.
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week...
they wouldn't know.
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
no more, man.
let's get that tent down!
thank you.
swear to god.
not at all. captain renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  captain, would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa?
what?
ben. are you okay?
tom grunemann. he wrote you some letters.
that's just exactly what he has been doing. this deal should have been closed weeks ago. tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
that's what mama used to say.
senator's son?
lemme tell you something. i'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century. if i have to, i'll go to the open sea to get them, but i'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
c'mon, seymour, please?
no, thanks--i'm doing this on my own.
what?
can it kill me?
and she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
you're such an incredible woman.
grace heard it.
sez who?
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
what am i, a goddamn postman?  i'm way the fuck up here, i'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  put a stamp on it for chrissake!
brill.
great.  i'll see you at the office at nine.
right, but -- i'm sorry, i don't see why you were corresponding with pg&e about it in the first place.
it's a contradiction, numa, get used to them.  the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  or fake secrets.
it's perfect.
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
jenkins!
more and more in the past few weeks. and she wanders. god knows where she wanders. i followed her one day.
applejack's stuck in the elevator?
jah -- you endorse his product -- he endorses your research.
...can't it wait? i'm good for it.  ...awright. come out, get the directions from natalie and hurry up.
you keep it.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
come in! come in!
so you are! the place is a pigsty all the time.
good boy.  call us if you need anything.
what you going to do?
i was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
no.
that was what we were led to believe . . .
it was the window.
yes, master.
i'm glad of it, honey.
that so?  you want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
but what happens when they do find out?
big question that, lad.  why what?
what?
where's the lady who brings the soda?
yes.
oh...lee, you are my whole world.  good god!  have you been kissed tonight?!
it's eleven forty-five let's go
you know, i came back to mount vernon to retire.  i don't need to be in government.
we need to talk --
darling, i was busy looking out for your interests.
go away.
god, i adore you.
she's innocent.
didn't mean to?  you put your sword right through his head!
to mothers.  and all that we owe them...
yes. thank you.
attic space.
go on, cut my clothes. i've got other clothes.
what outfit.
i had a little run-in with zowie.
colleen and johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
it' s fantastic! ----- this place is genius.
it's her birthday tomorrow. and i don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? it'll just take a second. she's right off the freeway.
are you bringing your laundry woman?
you figure him for a dope runner?
you'll get to see the file on this case. and there's another reason.
hmm, i see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  she knew stuff like that.
we did at one point. when we thought we'd have more children. and we after tried. we tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
mr. wallace, i could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16.
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
everything that's been missing.
some little kid stole the hubcaps.
prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
yes.
...i'm not finished yet, mom.
look, man, i'm the bachelor, alright? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
well, you know what they say. human see, human do.
so. five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. no woman since then?
yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
i was friendly with sue lefferts, but we weren't really friends. you know what i mean?
that's when you've got to fight them. that's when you've got to make them. that's -
oh, that'll come in useful.
what?
i'm getting back with my ex-fianc. he proposed to me right around here, so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
he gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
well -- i think you might consider
you would?
i was at first. then i was hanging on.  are you going far?
next week's episode.
yes, ben - are you going to die now?
what?
okay, i get your father, i get your mother and i get your brother, but what are you doing here?
yeah
cinn?
or disinformation... if you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? maybe one degree a minute?
don't say it, hawkins.  i'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
what?! i can't hear you!
don't worry... there will be enough.
butt-ugly owl.
they do? oh no...
is he all right?
i don't know. i wish i could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  i would know.
well, yeah, i was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. like, what if we run out?
we'll do this again! maybe next week. here's your hat. could i wrap something up for you? did you have a coat?
huh huh. you mean like this?
something lecktor said.
yeah, guess so. how'd you know?
the second wave has not returned.  and we have no idea where their carriers are. what is the damage report?
oh, no, that's the style. it's meant to be clinging.
you're right!
solid and genuine is not boring. michael can be completely insane...
all week long.
told you to hide it.
what else do you need?
don't worry, four eyes.
you're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
imposserous!
yes.
no ma'am. i'm a'goin' off sommers.
the truck's here. looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
j. c. penny's?
what? who?
when did you start smoking?
pure idiot.
that would be monumentally stupid. all i'm saying is --
bullshit. you had a vision. you got sign from the old ones.
look, i'm really sorry that mom and dad made you take me in. really.  if it's such a big deal, i'll go.  but remember this, it used to be fun.  it used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and i mean that in the best possible way, i mean it as a compliment. i mean, i'm sorry t-i-m left you.  but i am not t-i-m.
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
i'm not very hungry, thank you.
it's better you see for yourself --
claire.
herr falkstein! you have your instructions!
hey, business is business.  you use a gun, i use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  to put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  hans, baby...i'm your white knight.
yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. zuzu's sick.
not for long...
that is correct, major.
you'll never guess what's happened!!
no.  don't say anything.  don't do anything, and for christ's sake, don't apologize!
never mind! just play dead.
yeah.  it didn't make any sense.
relax. it's okay. take a deep breath.
bruce wayne.  -- i've read your work.  i quite like it.
lula, i got to get some sleep.
i love you so much.
that's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
you mean one leg on each side? scandalous! can you show me?
do you have mrs. george for english?
what?  win vietnam, sir?
it is day, of course, freya.
but i'm human. i know you view that as a weakness, but i'm sorry -- i <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. goddamnit, riddick -- yes. i would die for them.
who are you talking to?
you promised, tommy.
it wasn't reading, it was a performance. brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
wait a minute. what are you talking about?
that's me.
maybe, but if you didn't i think you would have kept on walking.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. figured you'd know something about that, wade.
horses, right. vernon something...  hardapple.
so did i....
horses.
no, caesar, gimme the gun.
even robert e. lee was a loser.
thank you.
well, oh...
the vodka.  what'd i tell you?
yes, a bracelet's been lost, but i'm still on my vacation.
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs. some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
i think you must be mistaken, sir.
but han and leia will surely die.
fine... holly will get you ready. you're in good hands, believe me.
well, fuck! might as well not do anything! let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
yeah. you know, one of those toy things. they sent me to the store to get it.
would you like to start?
you're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
the station complement was nineteen.
we keep going, that's what we do.  we ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
what are you talking about?
no. we'll be responsible for that, mister worf.
and you came here to what? to comfort me?
you boys are off of the spade outfit. got your own string of ponies?
i don't want you to do anything. let your conscience tell you what to do.
does koessler ask about me?
so i just heard her cries for help and all that, and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there, so i just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs. and that's about all, i think. i didn't actually see anything useful, i don't think.
that sign.  do you think i could have the room for a single night?
we offer ourselves at your service, mr denham!
not necessarily.
here? you gotta be kiddin'.
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you. where've you been hiding?
maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  it leaked and stained.
[listen! i will give you a life for a life.]
dead? mr. bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
i'm your sister.
i didn't ask for a closing argument.
thank you.
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
normal. average.
well, you tell her majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  what the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
right.
great.  terrific.  the good guys won one for a change.
where are we going?

mrs. mathews, your daughter is dead. she's dead.
what's the matter with you?
no more of that talk or i'll put the leeches on you.
it's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  want an eskimo pie? or a creamsicle? i'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. i'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
but i still want one.
what kind of a game?
go away.
one thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
i think so... they're just... so ...

hey! fuckin' a!
i -- i -- i...
you want some advice? don't do this again.  you know exactly what i mean.
i might ask you the same question.
why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? after all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. let's hear what the majority thinks.
i'm gonna open the shop, baby, i'm gonna open the shop. i'm getting it together.
after a court convicts him.  he belongs to me.
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars?
yeah, well i turned off the set. i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. you know what could've happened? the dog came in and stepped on it, turned the tv back on.
trickery and divinity.
by your leave, sir.
it wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.

steak?
well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
then why tell me?
naw.
i can't leave the house?
you are mistaken.
so i'm told.
for him, not for the law! i'm surprised at you, pete. hell, i gave you credit for more brains than delmar.
i was away from the monitor for a second. i had it on automatic. i had to go pee.
talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?

very weird.
no.
no, i'm just a friend.  what are you doing here, i mean...you know claudia?
no, i'm not, i'm not worried. i'm not worried.
always?
long ago.
you have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
it's spelled different, but basically... now you said it twice; just one more time, and i'll be free.  and then <u>you'll</u> be free.
and what does this do to our bargain? i cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
oh, my sweet westley; what have i done?
okay.
what's wrong.
no ... i mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  it's just i don't dream.  never have.  ... maybe it'd help if i slept sometime ... just kidding ... no, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  i'm jealous.  it's like everybody has another world except me. you know what i mean?
well, what are you talking about? i just told you i was gonna get a—
i'm not. i'm the sensible one. i'm always the designated driver.
i can't make it alone. you're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
yes. i want this over and done with.
yes it did.  mr. dunn, can i ask you a personal question?
get real.
my god, what?
nothing you could say would change the way i feel.
perhaps he really was a burglar -- but they don't kill a man for that.

nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
we're seeing all the signs in town.

i saw him last night!
joad. tom joad.
no, thanks, i'm nervous enough.
do you have bad dreams, too?
no.
it takes two to tango, mr. scott.
do you ever regret it? the divorce, i mean.
no, i didn't. i wanted to humiliate him. for what he did to dunbar. for fucking over the little guy.

if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this.
i know.  and i'm sorry.  i've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
well, that was a monumental waste of time! i pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
hey!  there are crazy people here.
i don't know. the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on. does that makes me some kind of fag?
i know you'll do it, dad.  you're viktor taransky.

you're out of your element!  this chinaman is not the issue, dude.
murder, sir.
can i ask you something personal?
i thought you called it your pecker.  look, don't make the mistake i made.  twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like miss october 1968, and where'd it get me?  here with you.
but --
come look at this.
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? it's all been denied. you tell your publisher--tell katie graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. good christ! that's the most sickening thing i ever heard.
i still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
yeah.
thank you.  tell me -- what do those words mean? "beloved husband"... "beloved son"... "beloved wife"...
int. ice cream truck/cab - day.
yeah, so where is he?
why?
well so do i, goddammit!  so do i! i had a life too, y'know - i had a life, too.  but you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, elizabeth!  it's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your tv and "i'm jes fine honey."  while our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  well, i'm not "fine" about that, i'm angry. my life is fucked, liz!  and yours is, too!  and if you don't want to support me i can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
what'll it be? the regular? black label?
you know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
haiphong.
seems too coincidental that way.
uhh...
why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
no, i don't.
to tell you?
why?
no, i... i've been out on the grader all morning. twombley's summer people. massachusetts. friend of gordon's. it was his idea for jack to take him hunting.  i gotta go.
is it legal?  i mean has anyone ever done it before?
i think so. what'd he ever do to you anyway?
that's a good idea.
yes. on the texas border. some kind of experiment. something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
stop fucking around, tom, and think. what are we going to do?
no!
what?
sure. are you kidding? sure.
i'm cool.
jason. he's what happened. then grendel hit space lab.
kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. this here is the ocean, and you're drowning. take my advice and go back to puddleville. you'll be happy there.
jordan, dear.  how are they treating you?
sporting events, yeah.
there is something i must ask the gods...
you?
then i can't be hurt anymore.
there's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
may i talk to you alone?
mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
i'm having the garbage searched. if my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like tiberian bats. they couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. somewhere.
you're kidding.
really?
barnes believes in what he's doing.
look at the bills. i can't. i'm not gonna put my daughter through what i went through.
well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in l.a., looking for you.
hey.
i, uh...i'm leaving.
the right nostril.  good.
you went out this morning and bought a gun.
were.  isn't that what you mean?  were. because he's dead, isn't he?  and that's why you've come.
you're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
get away from me!
well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
'course he's coming.
what's normal?
you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
don't know.
i remember you now..the so called art dealer.
who put my client in the hospital for life.
who could better understand than me?
go back to the car and keep brian there. i don't want him in here...  do it adele... now!
i saw brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
could be.
would you care to be more specific?
of course not, joe.  it's just that i don't want to be left alone. not now, while i'm under this terrible strain.  my nerves are being torn apart.  all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
i'm sorry...i just mentioned it in passing.  i never thought he'd use it.
i'll be in my office.
listen, i don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
i never knew that music like that was possible.
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
i don't like coffee.
it's mister marion.
maybe. 
yes, yes--the air--  --i'm getting plenty of air.  miss marsh--mrs. rosson.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  they got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, mantan and sleep 'n eat, y'knowwhati'msayin'?
yes, mikey?
quit kidding!  it's all over the front pages, you know, i've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley.
i start monday week.
well, what's that then?
dance?
didn't you see her this morning?
i've never heard of her. maybe something else was on his mind.
would a jury around here convict their own? i think not. we're beginning an interesting game here, mr. rains.
i see. you want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
that's right, we'll take a nap.  we'll get you to washington, we'll get you back to your buddies, and...
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
where is she?
hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! yes, that phone call.  i been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since i got back from that... "weird" war we were in.  you remember that?  here, take it, man!  you could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
hell, i got a gold watch... it just don't work. maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
really.
four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    and they resume seven minutes...
but the variety of food here is very pleasing... i commend you.
you got up! you *did* something! if you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
what do you think?  now we go in.
sit.
i got lured.
oh, yeah?
but that's what we're here to find out, right?
yes indeed. i need protection.
back where?
the sphere looks different.
there you go.
you're not.
thanks.
frances, you remember my lawyer, alma styles?
it's simple. bastaldi's moving up. he's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
she never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
they're coming in here, aren't they?
what you want me to call you?
i want mine to wear glasses.
do you know all their names?
there's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  i don't think that's a good idea.
harry, son.  harry.
good... good boy. oh yes, i understand you're fond of music. i have arranged a little surprise for you.
before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
that's right.
blow those suckers, driscoll!
no.
you were on the indianapolis? in '45? jesus...
he used to run the nasa. he knows where all the bones are buried. comes in handy.
starting now, we attack them.
sometimes innocents become involved.
huh?
s-ssstop that!
what is it if it ain't a curse?
that's it.
jesus...
well, guess i don't even need to be here...
what happened to 'em after that, willie?
a few.
a useless talent.
you probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  dreams work like that.  you want me not to go on this job?
bye.
i'd rather talk about number two.
he escaped.  he's going back in.
was it you?  in the plane?  who saved my life?
not a big music fan, eh?
it's a feeling you get in the jungle. when you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
answer. 
it's not good... unless i could find the crystal.  then it could be very good.
television?
yeah. she's quite upset. i'm going to fly out today. they want me to bring some pictures.
right.
there's no such thing as an accident. everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
no!  i'm not kidding.  don't you understand?  you're pure!
what would he be doing down there?
i don't know.  for me, i'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. there was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, i'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  she gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  eh?  what i'm saying, what is our life?  it's looking forward or it's looking back.  and that's our life. that's it.  where is the moment?  and what is it that we're afraid of? loss.  what else?  the bank closes.  we get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? none on 'em.  we worry anyway. what does this mean?  i'm not secure.  how can i be secure?  through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  no.  and what's beyond all measure?  that's a sickness. that's a trap.  there is no measure. only greed.  how can we act? 
not bad.  $20.  here, $5.
thank you, lloyd. godspeed.
oh shit.
i think i'm gonna move back east.
you don't ax your sales force.
all right, two thousand.
so?
you're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
you're the accountant inna family, and i figure you might know about these things. my boss wantsa sell his shop to me. his kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to california where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. he wants five thousand dollars down, although i think i can knock him downa four...
then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
brian, let me come to the point. i'd like to offer you a job.
this janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
well, dawn, i'm an optimist by nature.
i know what you mean, i know what you mean, i get this feeling --
i thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
i want him to think that.
oh, that's not me.  it's just that once in a while, i have some people in for a drink.

pretty good. i'm friends with dr. gaskell, too.

i don't know...
it happened to you before?
cahuenga pass. make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl. you should be able to pick up utopia's tracer there.  once you go inside, you're on your own.  you know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
haven't you been watching?
twenty minutes.
what?
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
... i think it would be best if you both left.
yes, and very beautiful.
you, too.  happy tossing and turning.
ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
good job.  and thanks.
he's your brother.
you thought it was just.
i'll fuckin' take it. to go.
believe me, it's no fun. when you fellas picked me up at baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
haven’t you? then why the worried messages on his answering machine, rhian? i’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
please, professor, why can't we go along with you?
heathcliff, jackie gleason, and in the role of catherine earnshaw, lucille ball.

my guess -- vernon hardapple.
michael invited me in.  never invite a vampire into your house. it renders you powerless.
only around humans.
what about?
i'm sorry. it was a national emergency -
i haven't come to you.
well i heard dr. humes stating that - he said...

yes.  it's a present.
i was hoping you'd say that.
they're playing games behind the couch ...
yeah.
that's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
it has to be tom. you said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
you're my only problem, ed. what does it take to make you go away?
i mean, why do you do it?  what purpose does it serve?
you know what i'm talking about. it's all over your face. that i-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.

andy... there is no real you.
twenty-four-five.
oh, on the contrary, the albatross is considered a very good omen.  it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  it's very bad luck if you kill one.  and dolphins too.

'beware romulans bearing gifts.' happy birthday...

poppea.  she was his wife.  and she was unfaithful to him.  so he got mad and he jumped on her.  up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  please don't jump on me.

i never played tennis. you just travel around bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  you must like taking chances.
what are you talking about?  my "condition"?...
that's a horrible ugly comment. "dead whore?" she's a person!

no.  no.
prepare what?
you're drinking it.

all the old men i know think about nothing but sex.
airight.  here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. you are a paycheck player.  you play with your head.  not your heart.  in your personal life?  heart. but when you get on the field --  _ 113.
i never joke about money.
yeah, i can see that. later i want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
how's my favorite president?
do you?
fine. but we're not going to let you do your job. because we're gonna do it. and then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
no, sir. plainly put, i never expect to sleep again.
almost... look, i gotta bounce. i'll holla at you later.
why, i'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
we agree on something.  and for insurance, take his coat.

but how do i know if i really love peter? and if he really loves me?
the rest of us see bathrobes.
this -- ? this is nothing. you know what'll kill me?  her.
weekend after next...
from me the doctor has no secrets. poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
you know how women kin lie... i knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. maybe. 
no, c'mon, i'm listening. i was just...
barks an argument and shakes his head.
you're one of us, now -- aren't you?
i was repairing the stairs.  i found a library and the books were very useful.

charlie?
fuck...  i forgot about that.
why were you scared?
wait a minute. get down off of there, augie.
we're on vacation.
that's an order!
yes, indeed.  it's cost my family quite a bit of money.
aw, don't get mushy.
i'll take some.
... he's an amazing officer.
yes!
i'm -- i'm afraid i have no money.
boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
never mind -- i'll go by myself.
hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i'm just supposed to take it, huh ? well, i'm not gonna, and i guess that proves i just can't cut it.
mark 12.
he's not.
what?
not that often.  he was excited to see you.
oh boy!
well, it's worth it, really? i mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim?
okay.  here she comes.
you liked it there.
look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
fine. roger, what the hell are you doing? you're bothering the serial killer.
this virus -- it... 
you know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. that's my advice.
it was not my intention to amuse you. these are serious charges. however, if you surrender now-
i've seen 'em.  i've seen 'em.
when did we get that?
hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work i go!
consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. no more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
-no cheesy poofs... what the hell is happening?
i don't buy that hot dog shit.  so you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to haleiwa.
yup!
no, sir. i'm as good as it gets.
by friday.
yeah. that sounds good. "hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
he doesn't remember anything, delly.  doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the bijou, anyone...
you're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? we've got your kiss song playing and everything.
yes, captain.
ah... yes, enormously.
what?
and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, i would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
you can't expect me to explain that to you.
don't have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
tell me that!  tell me that!
maybe she did, gus.  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
i got them right here.
i hope that isn't true. we need all the downy innocents we can get.
i'm sorry, honey, i can't.  not today.
and then?
no, not yet, not yet. you worry about it for a while, i've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
"you'll be burned out/or smoked out/an' come back to me, i know..."
what the hell are you doing?  are you crazy?
fuck factor ten.
so -- where do we start?
did you find a scalpel? did you find a murder weapon?
so what's happening with your book?
it's not the one...wait... there's a label.
well, we had talked...
maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
as you remember it -- when you approached us...
i will be with you, like this. forever.
so boring, so useless --
who's going to do it?
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
...what bar?
whatta ya know.  bayside, born and raised.
i wonder who'll recognize us first? they'll wet their pants.
uh-huh.
i'm isaac... i'm three.
get a job doing what?  you gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  to join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the great mother to protect us... why. are you staring at me like that?
what?
i guess.  i've got an ego same as any man.
you know, i've always been fascinated by show business.
that's a-no good.  if i apologize we no got a war.  look -- i send you a scrap of paper.  you send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
or murdered, like nix.
then take her to radio shack.
they never kill themselves.  how do you know it was him.  you never met him.  you never even saw a photograph...
mexico is a large country. where in mexico would you like--
are you in danger now?
i'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
you can't do this! you'll get in trouble!
eleven. in the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
where she lives.  in the guest house. now will you tell me what this is about?
at annie's house. she's all right.
okay, this is working.
mop rags --!
no kiddin'! i'd need the cash pretty quick there. in order to close the deal.
make it so.
what happened here?
the emperor has been expecting you.
do you enjoy it?
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop. what do you want to know?
i don't drink coffee...
thought you didn't believe his story.
that girl was vile to you.
yes.  the man made a business decision.
yes, finally.

have you known this all along?
if you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
he can't stay up there.
what did you do? bribe one of the guards?
cause the russian production company would be easier to find.
you don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
i'm a dangerous man!
jim, you been with a girl yet?
jesus!
vision? i'm a walking anachronism! i've upset my parents. i miss my kids. i could be trapped here forever! and poor charlie...i got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. tomorrow's my birthday! i've got to get out of here now.
ah yes, the lady is waiting.
i'm listening.
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god, and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france.
i have guests waiting.
eight, nine car lengths. a hundred and sixty-two feet.
i'd blame you.  i want you here.
if you'll just maybe ease it into second.
the...fourth of july.
i'm thinking about taking a trip.
and-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
i don't know.  i'm just guessing.
well i've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what i mean?
sure, mr. muss -- uh, sid said i could have the job back.
i haven't got it.
look at jerry graff.  he's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  you see?  that's thinking.  why take ten percent?  a ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  what are we giving ninety per...for nothing. for some jerk sit in the office tell you "get out there and close." "go win the cadillac." graff.  he goes out and buys.  he pays top dollar for the... you see?
i wrote a poem too.
well, then, talk to me some more.
maybe i like to find out about a man first.  maybe i like to know what he's made of.
wait up, i'll leave with you and lock up.
you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.
games?
yeah, well, i'm in l.a. now.
i'm here, cowboy.
i received my b.s. from the university of pennsylvania, my p.h.d. from bryn mawr college.  i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine, during which time i had articles printed in the "journal of educational psychology", "american journal of psychology", "psychology review" and "science"... so i think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
thanks, quince.
you seem pleased by the prospect.
ah, come on now!
yes, ma'am, it is.
call brent on the horn. see where he is. what he wants us to do. i'll head over to the school.
i was walking by when i heard a shout.  your men came right after.
oh, why couldn't i be the cardinal in charge of catering.... if the mayflowers get the three sections of da vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- aie-yi--do we got anything?  what of alex, hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
black, black...
my name is kazim.

so this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
three cheers for betty schaefer! i will now kiss that nose of yours.

hey, bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
i think you know i'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
i see what you mean... you're a beautiful guy. and you're doing a damn good job.
shut up!
that is simple, isn't it? i assume you can prove that if necessary.
it's over.  we have to give up.

i love it!

okay, there was a tasting last night. but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. check out the box.
that's where trouble comes into paradise. but the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. wanna see what "spiderman" number one looks like?
my son magua's pain is my pain.
i have money.
they're just people. alright? they got feelings, you know?
i liked the dog, for laughs.
then who's buying it?
i don't know.  i'm sorry, kay...
well -- i could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
it is at that.
because i must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
thirteen years...
you do? i'm glad. because i feel for you --
i'll admit it's confusing from the outside. you've got to see it from the inside.
i think so.
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
claire...
likes to kill? knox  women find him magnetic.
father?
no, sir!  i just want to do my part. to get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  and i have the experience, i know who the people are...
it's saturday morning.  let's go shopping.
...you are such a great guy. first the money, now this.  isn't he fabulous!?
one. here, in front of my ear.
at the most, which is impossible for him.
cris, you made it.  thanks a lot.
no, he didn't make me touch it.
thank you.
remember high school?
you bet i do, sir.
i won't allow it. those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. what do you think of that? that's from my quote book.
no.
spare us.
how to make a buck!
everything! ... madame colet, if i were your father--  which, fortunately, i am not--
she's just outside the door.
where have you been for the last seven years?
oh... yes... i don't have it with me.  it's at home.
really, why's that?
can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
what did you <u>really see</u>?  this whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  please, you've got to believe me...  he's got a gun, with real bullets!
we're screwed.  he's fucking with us.
i need corrective oral surgery. i need the braces.
i don't know.
look after yourself, grace.
and they all came...
dammit, it doesn't add up!  ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald's return.  only intelligence people can come and go like that.
nothing.
there's a phone in the car.
yeah? ain't that something? middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. only in l.a.
all right, you guys, shake hands.
honey, please...
don't you fucking knock?
look, now i'm pumping you. i'm sorry. it's none of my business. it's just that you're not like the others.
what!
baby, i can't give you anything but love...
why are all these people after me?
and you've no idea where he went?
but, leon, i am only here for a few days.
that's just part of being a woman. diet and exercise should help. avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
gotta meet a guy and head out for silverado.
if she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
let me see it.
hmph.
alive?
i don't think so. be happy to show you.
that it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... he gets like that sometimes.
what sub?
duly noted. now i'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
oh, shut up. you’re an optician.
john, where are we g --
if he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  we fucking had this game.
clean your mouth, or i will.  those boys had no business messing down there.  go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
anything you say, baby.
that's right.
we have it good, don't we?
the contract was stolen.
okay...
you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
well sir, i'll show you.
what?
oh, damnit!
i just put jim into black creek...are you acquainted with...
i'll get the tickets and meet you... in the gift shop.
he's right, kathy.
gee, this is a surprise, mr. gittes.
i don't like your tone.
we'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
are you married?
where's the bag she gave you?
you have a request?
a hospital? what is it?
"blazing guns of the west. true stories of jesse james." only a dime in the hotel lobby.
the marines.  good for you.  you must have served in korea.
i'm sure that's very flattering, birdie, and i'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
good.  it's terrible.
i'm one of the proofers.  i slipped the article in.
i'm working on it.
no!
you already have.  now go on.  do it.
hardly kissing. kissing off.
we got a party tomorrow night. can't have the place smelling like shit.
i'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  and, i accept.
that's not your mother, that's a man!
i don't care, philip.  you want to go chasing barbara zelman, go ahead.  just watch out for those buck teeth.
what did you say to me?
could you fill me in?
jeez... that sounds awful. hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
would you mind moving just a little? you're blocking my view.
what?
jesus, fergus, you're a walking cliche. you know we won't leave her out of this. but i'm glad to see you care.
gosh, this is really a great conversation--i can't believe i said that out loud.
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  he makes us quit the life at thirty.  he doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
it’s just two kids, right?
jimmy!
does that mean that you want me to go there?
you're sure now? you won't hire a boat or anything?
you sold eight mountain view?
really?
i'd wash that out with some iodine...  okay, mercurochrome.
i'm byron. nice to meet you.  c'mon. let's go get your luggage.
well, it's a small town. sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
oh, yes, i am, because <u>afterwards</u>--up here in the moonlight.
what are you talking about?
what? he's going to be all right!
is that what you think?
leary?
coming with you.
what do you mean?
but it's funny!  it's a practical joke.  they'll get frustrated!
what do you want, claude?
from up close or far away?
we're not playing in the street.
what's it about?
oh.
and don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
shit, i bet i been laid more'n you have.
hey, little dale evans.

spanish.
hi...
beautiful but so sad. i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
thank me next time you see me.
i just don't know if this says, "me". what's the fabric?
dallas?  could be.  he doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
you're fools, both of you! it's obvious they're out to crucify norville! they're trying to destroy him!
he doesn't know you.  couldn't you change?
if i'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
i wasn't sure you caught that.
hello.
hiding?
and they will be again, spock. that's the beauty of it.  how much?
just chill.
you lost your head.
i'll be alright. hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
no.
opening pod bay doors.
what's it to you?
so, what's this sarah got that you don't? three tits?
i don't know.
... for a commoner?
watch me.
no doyle. vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
enzo...
i sought only not to harm you, sir.
i'm frightened and confused and i... i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
i'm mr berlin.  mr ross is right here. and mr ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's o.k.?  o.k. .. i'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft- ernoon she left? take your time, and nothing's too trivial, o.k.
to strangle someone. choke him. squeeze out his life between your hands.
he knows where she lives?
now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
who's he?
um-hmm.  come with me, brother. i want to show you something.
bonjour.
yes! yes!
go to! what, goodman boy! i say, he shall: go to; make a mutiny among my guests?!
i'm going to tell the truth.
i'm sorry, i can't do that.  i don't have the time.  goodbye
sure i loved it! it was great.
whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  it's the american way.
just a girl, i work at magnin's --
no, silly - i'm still in school you know. but i'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. you better be careful, jeffrey.
...once or twice. his name is charlie meadows.
you look beautiful.
professor brown grinned. i guess i'll see you in... about 30 years.
yes, mr. hillyer, it was. i... i heard strange voices in the night.
-- cooch. woh. stop.
what's this?
no.
there's no danger. the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
o deadly sin, o rude unthankfulness! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not. hence!
army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  back home, we go out squirrel huntin', i walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
you're as bad as the rest of them, elaine!  it's all here in the design specifications!  look!  it's all here!
hi. you have hard shells, right?
we have decided to move the government to gitarama.
can i use the facilities first? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit.
jesus, what a rude person...
yes!
come here, sit down.
well, i got homework.
nah.
then they're not separated, are they?
you're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
i'm busy, duffy.
a mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. it's eleven now.  they're leaving. beat.
oh, don't be stupid.
why?  can he lay eggs?
new york is dangerous place.
wait a minute. do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
she's got him! you hear that?
i don't understand.
still, i wish i could remember.   but, i guess it doesn't matter anyway.  we know each other now, don't we?
we are always going to be all right tomorrow. i'd like to be all right a few todays.
and your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  and i've come this close to suing you for harassment.  and you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
gross.
well, don't do that again!
how did you guess?
steady!!...  now, mr. sulu!
in the briefcase?
what home?
for what?
well, i don't know how to put it - but i have this thing about girls.
only one way to find out.
in your dreams.
why?
yeah?
can you do that?
killaine's wise to what?
i don't know.  hey bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
oh bubba, think of the possibilities.
i like to travel....
beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
we've decided to go to montaldo's place. in fact, ettore should already be there.
a dress you wear in the evening.
i'll start with your news before i tell him mine, obviously.  mine isn't much, really, just about marie lasalle  playing at lounge ax tonight.  i like her, you know, she's kind of sheryl crowish... but, you know, good.  so i'll tell him before that. good news and bad news kind of thing.
he's alright, i guess. i hope. they're doing tests, that's why i'm home from school. i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind vista, i found an ear.
-- she's a figment of my own imagination.  i, viktor taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! and still no one appreciates me, recognizes what i've done -- even you.
with what?
she brought my digestive enzymes.
he cribbed that from borges.
you buy any of this, blair?
she fucked me.
this isn't '48, dick.  they'll never buy it.
i know, trinity.  don't worry.  he's going to make it.
who are you calling?!
just a minute –– just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante building and loan, i'll never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . why, in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why . . . here, you're all businessmen here. doesn't it make them better citizens? doesn't it make them better customers? you . . . you said . . . what'd you say just a minute ago? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
merry christmas...
why not?
just what i had in mind.  everything dead on earth except us.  a chance for mother nature to start again.  plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  sorry hon, this is for science.  behold the dawn of a new age.
what are we going to do about mike?
are you kidding? you guys'll he running this joint by then...
huh huh huh.

cat.
stay the fuck away from me.
pittsburgh, two years ago. partner died, no back-up, i was too gung-ho. as usual.
yes, your majesty.
and his 'egghead' son!  we'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
it's not so bad.
your doctor?
could your confess to father patrick from now on?
isn't it?
no!
i said stop it.
if i were to spare a few policemen, where would i station them?
oh.	ah...recently. all the kids drink it.
right.  so why don't we get on with this investigation?
will -- you can't trust him.
how un-sixties of you.
that way.
what's tira misu?
will you stop interrupting ?!  you will command the pumps to stop pumping.
i'll only be a minute.
those comics -- they never got the eyes right.
average rainfall, 48 inches. pisses down, october to june.
not a dump, then, but kind of plain. uninspired. and there's a stale smell. sort of stuffy. i don't know. stuffy.
too bad.  because i'm terrible at 'yes.'
i'm fine.
oh that. that was an exercise to prove a point.  about the evils of conformity.
if we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
i may have been infatuated with her - - but i wouldn't perjure myself.
what?!
what proper grounds?  you can't be in love with me.  you hardly know me.  i'm not in love with you.
i know.
what?
like a chihuahua?
what'd they ever do for you?
oh, i don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
you'll be hist...
yul brynner. they're all dead.
i'm coming to that.  vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  a direct hit is a positive retirement.
i only use it for medicinal purposes. don't be a pring...
john n. mitchell, while serving as us attorney general, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
what, you want to come in here and save me? is that what you want to do? do i have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
what's so special about it?
no. please enlighten me.
don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  it was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
damnation!  codfish and cockles! gammon and trotters!  you've bested me, jack.
we ran the i.d.  i could have told you that.
that's the problem.
come over around seven.
i can't promise you anything.
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
no -- a pride to know that i can force you to my will. i'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, i've had to do much that i did not want to do. but so long as the great dr. macfarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am i a man -- and if i have not that, i have nothing. then i am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
all right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! there's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
did you ever go i one?
no, mostly his wife's. she's in paris, france, right now. my husband delbert is real friendly with him. delbert's in law. does work for him.
that's crazy.  my husband is on trial for smuggling.
i can't have been under much more than a minute.
fuck the stereo. what's that smell?
i don't believe it.  you're a romantic, frank.
a dozen?  i got half of 'em elected. i still got the south and goldwater and his boys.  i'll take my chances with the senate.
james.
why do they care about our maps?
everybody ... move!!
then let's go talk to her.
take the test again.
we've known each other since grade school.
that's no surprise.
i don't know. who do you want?
well...
why?
right: lovers of the world unite!
you keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. do you understand that? there won't be anything left.
do you wash your hands before you type things?
that's a thick change of heart.
you said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
as what? a nazi stooge like you?
not with this...
what do you mean he won't do it?  he won't do <u>what</u>?  he won't do the sp...  it's what?  it's <u>corny</u>?  <u>corny</u>?  is that the word?  of <u>course</u> it's corny.  we wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  no we're, are you listening?  locked in.  we're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  tell ames to meet me at the west gate in... 
anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
i know and i'm honored...
i see it. i don't get it.
answer my question!
i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
well the police are going to want to speak to you. you know that.
why?  what do you mean?
oh, but it is.  he's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  that's a game.  it has rules and objectives.
oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
so?
oh sure ... you bet.  betty ...
no, eddie.  it's just that, i dunno.  he was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  all i remember is the voice.  it was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
what's his first name?
very lucky, i should think. you're drunk!
captain oveur, your navigator, mr. unger, and your first officer, mr. dunn.
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
don't go away.
where to?
the eyes don't lie. all this has gotten to you, hasn't it, petra? you came in as yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. tell me if i'm wrong, petra.
aye-firmative.
maybe it's supposed to end now. maybe god wouldn't have it any other way.
oh, some shit.
i don't know.
we should follow them!
this is what this is about?  out building project in indonesia? contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
who's "eleanor?"
el paso.
nobody ever said it.
i didn't know that.
mission district.  gonna find us an indian.
one cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--douglas points. one medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
yes. i think so, too.
explosive. we're blowing the walkway.
what guy?
and heavy...
oh man, i'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
he was watching a ball game on television.
you contacted us.  we were simply listening.  we've been listening for millions of years.
the man understood me. the woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that i was right.
thank you, travis.
no, ben.
when?
beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
what?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
i already said hello.
sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
jesus, mulder...
it's not true.  you have to believe me.
wow. i have to give this some thought.
i don't actually think jeffrey's gonna notice.
no.
seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee-wee hours.
well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
yeah, that's my pen. why?
all systems are working, commander. ,~ -cc	pink) -' c -
right. listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? did he eat some bad snails? slip on the bidet? what?
hold it.  mary patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
that was my plan.
big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  on <u>land</u> maybe.  but...
so we on tomorrow night?
it's right here.  this region; an-nagaf. i got recon photos.  there're no troops there, no fighting--
that ain't the worst part.  her little sister, baby d.  she's the one that gets real physical.  but i got a restraining order on her, too.
goodnight.
i said i'd call you the minute i got free.  and i did -- and here we are.
you guys do all the odd jobs.
pow!  what!  kazow!
that's them trying to kill us.
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. not tom, you said, the dumper was clearly not tom.
i found the car! he's here!
just say no?
i can't believe this is happening.
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
you loser!
i get it.  yeah, i can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
yes, yes -
first things first, we have to get you healthy. you need prenatal vitamins. incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. find out where you're going to deliver.
yeah.
hey, you're a hip chick. you look like you stepped right out of life magazine. any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
i could stand something regular.
there's a tiny door in that empty office. it's a portal, maxine. it takes you inside john malkovich. you see the world through john malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike.
it certainly does.
i don't know.  but the boy, he couldn't kill them.
i remember something lost ... i'm so confused! oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! do you think i could have... belonged to you ...
aren't we all, mrs. peel?
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
do you know that house?
jesus, my legs are asleep. i'll never be able to win this shit.
walter, please--
let the hooker go.  she's not important.
what's fergus?
damn.
we invested in these factories. in vancouver.
kinda. yeah.
i drink. a couple of occasions more than i should have.  i was cited for shoplifting once. but it was a mistake...  i pushed liane one time. we were both stressed out because of the pressure. she went to her mother's.  i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself. and i don't like to be pushed around!
well... i do cheerleading now. it's way cooler.
i'm sorry, lee.
i'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
our saviour...
i don't know.
oh...i came close once.
good. zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. the rest of us will come in through the front door.
that would be mars krupchek.  jesus, he works for me, too.
sill? what else would i be working with?
you know better than that.
really?  i was thinking the same thing. if we could call time and get together for a while.
i'll give it everything.
john! great to see you! sorry about the cunt at reception.
i know you're not surprised i'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
what the fuck are you following me for? i'm not a suspect here.
yeah.
yeah. marvin's old man gunned him down.
not at all.
the senator...
you're a liar.
i don't know.
maybe she doesn't need any.  should we check?
whatever you want.
don't ask me. price was elected security.
um, well, you see...
how's bugsy doin'?
ma'am, i'm very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but i'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. i don't do that sort of thing.
we'll take our check.
such as?
thank you.
you're in a hurry.
oh, right.  baking powder, we need baking powder.
if you mean that you are afraid of us--
darrell's a moron.
oh!
what for?
a common thief.
the three-letter code group.  or maybe some combination of the three letters. p...o...e, or p...e...o, or e...o...p... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
there's another wire from peter, sir. they're in glen falls, michigan.
has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
where would we find him?
can't beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
oh, no ... women is all we got.
no. please, monsieur, it is a little game we play. they put it on the bill, i tear the bill up. it is very convenient.
some.
no.  in the morning.
so reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
--hunch. just sort've saw 'em there.
please... that's enough. i *loved* you, too--you know i did.
people are going to know who's responsible.  and they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
maybe what?
did he tell you where he was going?
why? what difference does it make? you already got his money...
that man -- who is he?
how's the pain?
don't even think that i'm buying that.
no, i'm not going to take it easy. you can't stay clear of this guy. he will be on this until the end of time.
but... but...
cool out.  i ain't about to get blasted.
no, your mother did, then i did after she passed.
you heard me.  you. congress and cabinet heads.
what?
fine.
i mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
but you know, i should  really be the one going .
credit card.
that's just it, charlie. that's what i'm driving at. you could do anything in that time.
murray's dead.
yes, if you can get him free.
oh no, i'm not. i don't like your face. besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. i'm surprised that mr. cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
hi miss dunlop. where do you keep the old town papers?
like what?
how i go.
if it's a suicide, i seen weirder, jim. 
where are you off to young lady?
hello second mate barnes. i was instructed to come to the bridge.
check your code again.  no one at base would pull a stunt like that, terry.
[the what?]
that's not the point.
didn't think about it at the time. so no, it didn't strike me odd.
...hell.
not to me, they're not.
we're running it through the computers now. so far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. it's a haystack.  what's the other?
she isn't?
oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
take charge of him. get him a suite at the imperial and hire some bodyguards.
i expect.
i dunno.  what's he gonna say?  they had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  i don't even know the guy. don't get me wrong, jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  she had her life, i had mine.
then why don't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing?
i should be going.
redneck heaven.
frankly, sir, it stinks.  i have no access.  i'm lucky helms lets me have a staff.
ben, the money's not important.  we could <u>save lives</u>.
i don't know.
that's none of your business.
give me that shit.  your wife.
a few bucks.
so maybe this is my dynamite.
oh no, i couldn't.
are you glad?  i'm glad.
no, i'm serious.  you know what kurt potter is?  he's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. he's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pg&e offered 20 million.  he doesn't work like us, ed.  there's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
i don't either. i used to. but i'm through with that. y'know, if i don't love my body, then i'm just lost. you know? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  so, i've been seeing this guy...
what do you mean?
has to be.
the streamers? they're no problem, you just pull on them and --
i didn't kill myself. i died from a blow to the head. how'd it happen? i have to know.
i don't know.
what do you want to know?
the mondrian, room 504. i was checked out in my absence.
no.
...shut up.  decide who should be dealt with how?  is that the thing? i come into the fuckin' office today, i get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  i get accused of...i get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
well, he's the only one in america who doesn't!
he's lying.
oh, god, no!
mr. lime - yes.
we must be friends, charlie.
it's never happening again. right?
hey!  virgil!  my god!  morgan!  hey, boy!  you look great!  both of you!
what?
don't count too much on my friendship, ricky. in this matter i'm powerless. besides, i might lose ten thousand francs.
quite a transportation jam we are having outside of frankfurt! they are very angry in berlin. they will be even angrier on the east front, waiting for that ammunition train. don't you think so, lieutenant?
yeah!
i can't take that chance... i couldn't live with myself if i did anything to you.
i felt you...looking through me...
sally?
i know.
it happens to me all the time.
something like that.
naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
four.
i'm just so scared of that song. that fucking, "my son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. i got lots of bills come again next day. he's grown up just like me...my boy is just like me." gordon fucking lightfoot, cat stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
1530 hours.  might still be there. base out.
look, ted, i'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  three marriages, two divorces...you're gonna be okay.
blow me.  have i said that to you guys recently?  blow me.
what the fuck are you.. ?
yes.  that follows.
i don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think?
are they too sporty?
we'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
int. gomez's helicopter - day.
he's a soldier.  he doesn't need a weapon.  he's got rocks.  he's got bare hands.
i just got released five minutes ago.
come on, you can make it.
i went out to delmar.
but suppose he loses?
what if i was a relative?
i can't take him.
that's not faith, it's physics.  the second law of thermodynamics.
yes. we lost five.
i know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, i'm sure.  i just... i need you, rob.  that's it.  and we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
sure it is.  you want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  why?
oh no.
like this? look at me! like this?
twenty-four isn't young.  i'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  i've never been with anybody but darryl.
it's common knowledge you hate children and animals. why are you back in metropolis?
you'll find yourself another rich old lover.
then it's true, dammit! i had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. when the monotones did "book of love —— chapter four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." i'm thinking did we break up? 'cause if we did, i don't even know about it!. i thought we cleared all that up yesterday. did that maynard g. beatnik give you what you wanted?
suppress it.
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i'd just poured him. then i tried to deck the sucker.
you heard me.
nothing.  it got messed up.
why do they switch the r's and l's here?
as long as he keeps out of the park.
i don't want him hurt...
it's a crematorium.
no, of course not!  why?  would you care if we were?
no, but between the lines, eh? mysterious circumstances, and that.
pick me up in five minutes.
i'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
if you don't know what you've seen, why should i?
having a pint in the metro, and dil's having a margarita.
jesus... this is inhuman.  uh... i wasn't told of any operations in this area. they shouldn't have been here.
i'm wery sorry, but --
they got him standing by.
what for?
so we've got problems.  everybody's got problems--that's normal--
no. i work for national paper. it's a good job. i make eight-twenty-three an hour.  when i get enough money saved, i plan to go on to college.
go on home. just leave me the money.
were you going to give it to them?
i don't know.  maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  maybe it was all a hoax...  the safest thing would probably be to do a chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
foolish?  tell them how foolish it is, paul -- tell them!
i have but well, you know, i've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, i'd like you guys to take a look at him.
wallace's? for treason there is no trial. tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
i was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on ba'ku children. my last memory is going into the hills, following a boy...
rose, darlin', you break my heart. but i am only a human man myself of the father variety. rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
well, you run on now.
i'm doing this wrong, aren't i?
what's her?
she was just too young for you.
women... nothing surprises me, chip. excepting your late mother... who even knew selina had a brain to damage?  bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  meanwhile i got badder fish to fry.  yeah -- oswald, please.
that thought makes me feel awful.
and you have conclusive evidence of this? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
don't you think he knows something about this, general ripper?
i never thought it would end.  then it did.  it was so great to be saved, i couldn't stop laughing.
shoot.
speak.
yeah, steve. steve was all right for awhile.
i guess it isn't.
what was she to creasy then?
divorce was her childhood aspiration?
think about it.
it's totally out of context.  i was protecting the national security.  i never intended --
how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! waiting for--!
because you don't listen!
i should think that would be obvious at this point.
don't underestimate me .. the mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - how many times have you been up at that institute?
what?  oh yeah, the camera man?  they gave me a list.
please wait till my husband gets home.
you don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
were you a disco guy?
and i'll be a visitor.
right.
i said: don't look.
i gotta get something to eat, i haven't eaten all day.
it's none of your business. she didn't have small eyes.
i can smell her perfume.
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie. everything.
man, i wanna smoke a joint.
yes?
that's right.
mmmm.
killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
snuff.  i must insist you try some.
she ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
oh. okay. right.
nick the greek.
i don't particularly want to talk to you.
how's he get around out here?
why wait?
maybe.  but what if he dies on the way back?  you see what i'm saying, sir?  the best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to caen and catch up with division.
tsk.  excuse me, i didn't think he had change for a hundred.
yeah?  so?
for chrissakes, it's only sand. you should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. that sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. now eat it!
this might do ... i don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  we're trying to keep our costs down.  you know how it is when you're starting a new company.
go get it.
no.
a bunch of us girls are going for a swim. want to come along?
what is it out there, anyway? forty-five knots?
you have to ask?
hello.  i wonder if i could have a little word.
in fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  a completely successful fabrication of the past, the ploughman's lunch was.
i... i am.  mitch, is... mitch, this isn't usual, is it? the gull yesterday when i was in the boat, and the one last night at annie's, and now...
i mean, i want to... i just, i feel strange...
oh yes -- that's right -- look! i win, don't i -- 
anybody at all.  feel free to speak up.
thanks. it does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
i hate to disappoint you -- i mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
paris.  i live in paris...
we don't split up!
has she ever spoken to you about me?
certainly, outside. all the best homes have 'em outside.
my period? no.
well, if i did i certainly wouldn't say it to you!
there was an accident.  a fucking car accident.  all of a sudden. boom.  jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
you didn't answer my question. in fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
tolerably well. i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
so whattya say, kid?  you in or out?
normally, i'd say no.  everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  makes sense.  but what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
that's the core: the gravity drive. the heart of the ship.
the guidance system's fried.  i had to switch to manual.  -- some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
care to wait a decent interval?
why is she eight pounds over?
well, no...
how is he?
he's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
poo -- tmmm anngh ma ritz!
but i want to.
was i picking on you?  how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
did you know him?
no.
notice? like what...?
i need your help.
all bands.
get in.  this side.
all of it?
a journalist! peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! i know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? so a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! no, walter, i'm through.
but i didn't do this!
what kind of talk is that?  so you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
i will. but i must find the right moment.
this is really awkward...
why would you want me to kill you?
all right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. so, you enjoy the suspension. 'cause there's nothin' you can do about it. let the commissioner and the d.a. jerk you around. so you wait.
you take charge.
don't worry sid i'd never leave you like that.
shut up.
get in.
and i can't stay here in my condition. i am going to die tonight. it's already been decided.
set?
...what a world.
pull it.
right.  now whenever he stands at a podium, the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
you what?
come here!
hi.
no harm done.
watch him close.  ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
what's in connecticut?
i'm not! i'm going to the fourth world! it's like heaven, only better because there aren't any christians.
forgive me, don bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
oh he as clever about that.  he called when you were out.  that same afternoon, julia telephoned to him. she said that you were coming, mimi, to ask about wynant. he got terrified. he was afraid that julia would break down and tell... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant's watch chain in her hand.
after all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
what's up?
slow down, slow down.
i doubt it. the water is only an inch deep.
listen, captain cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  but those boots are unforgivable. what is it with men?
shut up, starling...
you've got to pick three more numbers.
you don't look so good.
it's an object lesson in grace.  wow!  look who's here before me!  my leading man is on time for once.
and i'm gonna nip it in the bud.
we will take her. you all stay here and watch dad.
a little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
there probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
julia.
not at all.  i'll catch you later.
watch out!
i bet.
sure i do. he has the best room in me house. the one with the fancy wallpaper.
he said the tower, but he's on comb bluff?  frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the douglas shaft.
hey, no kidding?  in color?
a lot of my friends are doing federal service...
five hundred dollars.
look, sir.  i'm no expert on the subject, but i've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. you can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  and if i were going to try and hide a few, i wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  we're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
big.com. that internet thing.
she called to apologize. i said i was pulling an all-nighter. she said then come home just to say hi. which i always do when we fight, it's suspicious if i don't.
i keep explaining.  you've got the wrong man.  my name is bellini - antonio bellini.  bellini, caravaggio, both painters, i think that is confusing you.
yes, of course. sorry.
no!  nothing more will i tell you now. clear your mind of questions ... quiet now be ... at peace ...
my ex-husband works in satellite communications.
i don't want him.
sir?
nobody knows more about this thing than you do, john.
that's what i said eighteen months ago.
a blank canvas!  i could paint your portrait, directly on you. or maybe not.  so, you?  husbands? boyfriends?  girlfriends?  where do you live?
can't we just dump him fast someplace?
yeah... yeah, i'm fine.
meet me back here in twenty-five. we'll kick this open if we can. but, case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
tell me what i am, rowan.
no. not really.  but also because i really want you to be alright.
it was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  i knew that was too much.
and with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, frank.
why?
no, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
yeah?
go ahead.  sing your ass off.
well, why didn't you say so? why all the coy disguises?
lucky kid.
nothing.
no, you don't. have you learned nothing from this strike? why are you afraid to have me at your side? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none?
i'm sorry.  i don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  you've been a great help to me, and i've let you down.
that is one mean lady. bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
look, there's something you should all know.
i told you i'm looking for someone.
jack.
are they all crazies?
i have to go now.
no.
but, erik...
somebody shut his lights. i guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
really?
the shiny stuff. the ice. the big, big, big money is available's what will the english says.
right. alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, i'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and i'll give you a call back --
you are?
that's not correct.
you know what?
the dead get out?
don't leave me here to die -- theo, please -- you can't let me die --
i'm sorry, i had to get dressed.
my client can't walk, your honor.
after all these years of blissful silence, i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
why not?
i don’t know. he seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
i think it's great.
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up, then i'm crazy.
you see ghosts, cole?
i can't.
i'm sorry.
it's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, louis. but we can do it...and we're going to.
uh, well, i'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
from my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. you scored big.
then we'll all go to jail together.
that's strange. nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca.
your father can be in nome, alaska, tomorrow.  we have two choices: ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the shark can put back into nome...
thanks, nick.
listen, i'm coming over. don't go anywhere. stay right there.
no -- absolutely not --
what do you like to eat here?
guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
someday, you may not mind so much.
i don't want to move away.
a heart --
creasy. just call me creasy.
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace!
good memory.  you must be great with numbers.
i've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
you're the worst driver i've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... europe, united... any place... asia.
you can trust me.
nick, what is it.
who's the lucky fella?
i heard you were back in town, kitty cat. you’re here for the highland flings, i bet.
my money? why, mister stevens? what a quaint idea. come over to the door. i want to speak to you privately. stop throwing away that money. we mustn't let people see any softness in you, mister stevens.... people take advantage of softness, you know. come out of there -- i'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
no. is detective gordon going to be at your house?
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
that's open to debate.
no, benjamin. i don't hate him. unhook my blouse.
well, we all got to go sometime.
of what? they're both crooks.
leland leave her alone... she doesn't like that. stop it.
thank you, keeper.
no.
you <u>are</u> a lunatic!
are you sure?
tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
all of us.
the broad has disappeared...
spock, you want to know something?
right....
and i'm still just a lad myself.
one has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
i prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
what?  you can't do any what?
uh...
i --
abstract?  with his talent for realism?
what's happening?
that's it, i am just stupid teenager, yes?
might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
no. unlucky. i have not been lucky.
fuck you, george.  i knew you'd say something like that.  always thinking about yourself.
no. thank you. i'm in... a hurry. i just want to make a change and start...
i always thought jails make people hard. not you. you're just not tough enough to forget about beynon. i chose you, not him.
every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
it <u>is</u> beautiful. but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so i gave it to my secretary.
so do day jobs.
about as good as it looks.
that's a dumb thing to say.
there were admirals.
it’s because i’m shy, betty.  so, when are you going to leave that old corpse mr. peterson and run away with me?
it's like i go to sleep, and he shows me things but when i wake up, i can't remember everything.
i went up to the magic castle. you were right.  he didn't have a lot of fans up there.
you swore you'd fire me if i came in late again.
you don't know?
no.
i didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. i couldn't leave her in the street. let's go.
makes her look even more innocent.
i am. dinner with brock leviathan...
so you see, i'm not going anywhere.  unless it's upstairs with you ...
enough!  he is dead.  you are here for me now.  michael is gone!
the moment of truth.
. . . what?
never heard of it.
"the" cause of dullness in others --
i underestimated him... he did the one thing i didn't anticipate ... he destroyed himself...
god, i hate that bitch.
i don't know... i'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... he must be still in there.
so, what happened to ms. caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
your reputation is secure, scotty.  mr. sulu, take the con. i'll be in my quarters.
did they have any explanation for this?
my doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. they wanted this cleared up in court. they want their vindication. i agree with them. but for today the offer stands. before we begin the publicity of a trial. for today only.  when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  as long as you understand that.  it's got to be that way.
nonsense- samuel would have done something. 
yup.
he takes himself seriously.
hey charlie.
we have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
actually, i need to review the deposition questions tonight. maybe tomorrow?
i'll bet you're a real yo yo.
i won't be at the office except to sign in.  i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.  i'll come home right after work.
i don't know.
are you serious?
chosen to go to the graveyard?  why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
yeah. good bye.
smell something fishy, huh?
did i?
we gotta move...
i am not a dream.
well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
you've never been here?  let me order for you.
but is she, has...
because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
but surely rogers isn't --
guess i'll get another tecate.
oh... are you... ?
how about your two friends?  you don't have a man dying in there, do you?
i don't think so.
you can't just abandon me.  alone.
hey, take it easy.
you're frightened.
they're not guns.  they're particle throwers.
i'm not snickering.  i'm smiling. because i'm happy.
you...
oh --
they're going to love you.
stop pushing!
would you like a piece of cake?
look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- i don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.
bullshit. marty's plan is only about efficiency. i've got two cousins on the job, you think i'd work for him if i didn't believe in it?
not too bad.
never heard of 'em... new owners?
i might say the same.
bandit?
he will absolutely hate it.
frank.
i'm sorry about zeus, millie.
she didn't give me a chance.
...i thought i should tell you. i didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
but the composition as a whole -- i've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
what do i do? i'm the vp of finance.
hmmm...
gruner switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to chiang cho.
this is another victory, my friends. what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
yeah -- we'll see.
look, i'm just not wearing this arm band.  i don't care how big the deal is.
you didn't have to tell me.
beer?  well, all right.
your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card.
i wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
i could use some help.  show me around.  i'll pay you for your time.
oh, yeah, tell everyone i'm crazy. beauty ida.
there's someone in the house.
i think you know. your eyes say you do.
what do you mean?
to keep it away from them?  no pirate would sail to london, for fear of execution dock.
can i help you?
yeah. i've got it here in this bag. i thought i should bring it to you.
ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
i await the word of vigo.
i'm so tired -- dr. dreyfuss here -- drink this.
it's me. nicky.
i'm fine. i'm
maybe.  maybe with the crazy whites.
what?
yeah... look man, what i gotta say. it's just you, me and the rats, right? alright... well... sabu's back.
are you serious?
i didn't know where else to keep it.  where would you?
i'm gonna be on tv! just like diane sawyer.
naw.
well, you'n me'n pete'n tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground...cause i got no limits in the air!
give eve harrington job in you office.
readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. i've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. these drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  you seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. you got somethin' wrong with ye?
i have money to buy more, but i haven't had a chance since...
this is a considerable move up for you, daniel. the temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
is anybody besides you here now?
great.	when can you do it?
so let's go. this place creeps me out.
i do wish to be baptized.
indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! then he talk in this real scary voice!
kid, the plain fact is...you are. i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. technically, they absolved you. you and i know what really happened. you pushed it. you are responsible and you'll always carry that. you know what, i'll carry it too. i should have taken you out of that cockpit. i guess i'm a hopeless romantic... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. it's no trade-off. it's not one for one. what you learned isn't worth his death. it couldn't be. but maybe there is some value in it. i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you. now the question is, what will you do with it. if it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. that's one good thing. you were an accident waiting to happen.
but you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, i know you have.
do you live in a house back in wherever.
like hell i am.
mr. bernstein, these men who are now with the "enquirer" - who were with the "chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
...'bout ready to mix it up...?
uncle bobby?
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
do you have the musical, "annie"?
you sure you want me to?
what?
may i?
from whom?
i'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
i told you twenty!
alright, alright.  i'm sorry.
swat wants to go in.
even christ would partake socially.
no. i'm learning the banjo. do you?
let's hope i can say the same about you one day.
neither can i.  what do you think they're doing now?
you awake?
yup.
'cartwright, wainwright, whatever your name is, i promised little jimmy i'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that i may be a little late.'
well, sir, if you should do it again, which i hope you won't, please remember the order. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
yes, it was -- i ended up --
from what i understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
hey, hey!  the fuck you doing?!
yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
i'm in love with you, ellie.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
they will be ready. you guys do your job.
hope you enjoy it.
i don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  now give it to me-- i can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
this.  this whole god damn thing.  making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  for what?
that is another matter. there is a price to all this, required both by longshanks and our nobles. pay it, and you will be our king. and we will have peace.
oh my god.
no prisoners. don't worry, frank, just a little psychological first aid.
you mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
i don't know... to grow, to go out. whatever you want.
jesus, val, it's pretty far.
like a drum.
oh, right!  right!  with those things running around.  no way.
i'm here to talk to you, sonny, not ...
oh boy. peggy, what are microchips?
what! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? not so you could notice it! now, look, i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
then what, tom?
well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it. will that do?
jim mason?  oh, yeah. yeah. no, i didn't send it. i've got it written out, though. here it is.  "arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. don't think we should fire him. longfellow."
well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. do you have any reason to believe it did?
you already made the delivery?
minimal.
i'm sorry. how was your evening?
our mission is coffee, tom. a shot of the bull, puerto rican espresso.
lights out, sam.
somehow, when all this happened... i knew it would come back to john.  is he really dead?
when dad died, i saw another fire...
sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  did he say anything while he was still lucid?
market crashes.  bomb drops. greenhouse effect affects.  we'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  in 1992, europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  it's one party we'd love to poop.
but sir, i don't understand.  this report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
david, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? do you really?
if you don't  keep your neck in and your nose clean and you'll never have no trouble down here.
everybody's a doctor around here. this apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  the guy i'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. what kind of doctor?
how?
you'll hit something!  can't you go higher?
easy!  it's forty miles, sonny...horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
i like it.
nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
hello!
no.  they make me sick.  they smell like death ... i had two brothers die young.  but let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  there is such a thing as evil.
baby! stop!
driver!
yeah, let's bury her.
shut up!
lunch for whitey.  something to munch on in case things get dicey.
sorry, flip.  got sidetracked.
i wasn't star--
oh.
what man?
taken care of.
he's three. why don't you wait till he's a little older?
well, you can't win 'em all.
well, i'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  you wanna change this subject, you better have a war.  what do you need?  it's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  okay?  what do you need in an enemy?  somebody you fear.  who do you fear? som'b'y you don't know.
mountain view.  eight units.
would you really like to?  that would make me very happy.
you are reckless!
tofu.  ben, i wish you wouldn't.
jack.
i know daddy. i'm worried about him.
daddy, it's like i been tellin' ya --
you don't understand. i've killed, i've hunted, and i've enjoyed it.
i got half.
who gets the privilege?
for now that's all.
ciao.
it's ok. don't worry about it. accidents happen.
i been told to take your car in, sir.
yeah.
no idea. i didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
you don't know that.
you don't want to hear about it?
now, listen, fred. just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. i'll get results. i'm doing everything humanly possible. i've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
one hour.
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country. he was afraid with no one home i'd— get into bad company.
here. take your fifty cents back.
mr. rose, i'm in the *doctor* business.  if you want, i can help you. you don't have to go anywhere.
i've explained the situation to mr. mitchell up to a point.  now about this mayfield girl?
i don't get you.
that's my name, maximillions. don't wear it out, babe, or i'll make you buy me a new one.
is it real?
she plays the clarinet, too.
i... i just don't want to come.
i'm not unhappy.
socially... i'll have a beer.
thank you, no.
i'm sorry for the woman, fettes. but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  as for me, fettes, i let no man stop me when i know i'm right -- when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  and if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as i see it.
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
i will. you're terribly direct in your questions.
there's another one!
that's right, sir.
sergeant?
well... i'm out of the hospital.
the drinking.
your parents'd kill you.
why not?
ten minutes...
it did?
no, i should stay calm.  like you say.  right, norman?  stay calm.
are you sure you saw that?  in the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
what are you talking about? this is the new mac. you a hacker?
but that's simone's part.
i realized he wasn't serious.  he was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so i ended it.
count it.
i'll look it up for you.
if it comes to that. yeah.
the only memento i ever kept.  my original sketch for the monster.
i'm president of the international fletch corporation.
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
where's sean?
i'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, i've decided.
it's my birthday. i'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and i think i should celebrate having made it this far.
he looks like my uncle.
do you really want this, dick?
just a minute--i don't think we need the word "back" --where <u>is</u> "back"?
george. george - do you mind? i'm sorry, but i can't talk about it tonight.
i couldn't have another bite.
what?
shhh... that's for me to know an' you to find out.
alright. you have my attention, rose. can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
uh... i think i'm seeing something too. it's like a really long time ago...
depends who it's from.
i was thinking, maybe we should ask professor daitz. nobody knows this stuff better.
you lying bastard...
oh, great.
maybe.
sure.
no, not yet.
break a leg.
psst. vince!
you're not what? qualified for anything else?
uh huh.  okay, enough practice.
ludwig?  he's gay - are you jealous?
no, mr. gittes. that's what i am doing with the valley. the bond issue passes tuesday. there'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. i'm doing it.
but he's dead.
confirm this with my office and my client.
you son—of—a—bitch. how could you let them put the implant in my head? how?
my pleasure.
yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
but this guy you called, he's not even army --
but what if it does?  you might need my help.
obviously.
well, you know what that would do to me.
that's fuckin' poetic, craig.
why did you wait so long?
morning, max.  bummer about the store.  you insured?
oleg, don't be paranoid.  you got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  i gave you half of what they gave me.  look - here we are!
i've died once already.  it wasn't so bad -- in fact i recommend it.
yes.
but then we knew that all along, didn't we...
why does he do it?
i know who would know.
no, no, no—that's your seat.
for how long?
and what makes you think you killed a man?
and that is my last word on the matter.
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. push the issues.
i don't give a damn about the money.  i want you, and i want to get us out of this shithole.  there's only one way to do that.
it was on the television.
i wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
thank you.
oh, i put a few games on for your daughter.  i hope you don't mind.
i'm confused about a lot of things right now. charlie's only one of them.
cleaned up?  it can't be cleaned up! without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  that's what we've been trying to tell you!  the only thing we can do is run!  run!  run!
yeah.  a billion.  right... how are you?
no.  that is, i bet it turns out i've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
ahhh...
aww, what's the difference. i'm all washed up... when you're dead, ya stay dead... hey, fella!
we are...  living in their dreams...
naw.  i bet'cha it's something better than air.
what flickering light?
when i traveled through asia this summer, i went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so i could call up sports phone in new york and get the scores. i drove through the war in afghanistan calling sports phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
i think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
hamish, i... thank...
ben!  ben!
overpowering?
i think so. i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
finish the job...
i love you...
laura martin.  this is will maddox, the primary negotiator --
well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
i think you need more help than you've got.
what? oh, i'm...busy.
oh my god. is her son ok?
hey man--
isn't that what we want? germany all over again? only done right this time...
we have.
i don't know what we're talking about.
i'm not scared.
good. where is reting rinpoche now?
pendergast may be in trouble.  don't you understand?  he still hasn't come back.  it's been over three hours --
where's my name?
what do you mean, you're not going? we promised.
what's it called?
in case???!!! in case of what? in case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
you're taking a big chance.
yes i am.
you know i have a way with the computers.  i can clear myself for any area.....almost.
yeah.  yeah, she's fine.
it's fine today, robert.
wow, are you in deep shit.  you know he'll break your heart.
high mag, mr. sulu!
yes.
whoa, whoa -- i don't know what you're talking about.
yeah, you can have the key. it's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. i give it to you with pleasure.  now i'm free. see how easy it is, jack? all you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  i've got to call my brother.
too little?  too little. okay, wait for me.
don't be thinking i'm not already working on it.
what?  like amnesia?
oh, uh, right, thanks...
what happened...?
i call him the boy with the ice cream face!
you were going to drive me around. drop me at lax.  never be the wiser. but el gordo missed the elevator.  so we go to plan b.  pop the trunk.
we're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
you always know the right thing to say.
i'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  we are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  oooh.  it is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
oh my dear yes, i bought a little ranch out west, sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder. a tax write-off, actually.
cause i had a bad dream about him. i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr. crandall buried him in the pet sematary.
you're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  it's at the grand central.
forget it.
sorry - it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
not at all, john.
no... could you?
mm.
you mean until you showed up?
you didn't see the killing, or the body? how do you know there was a murder?
'again'?  dad... you haven't had company in this house since mom died eight years ago.
out-of-town.  that's all he'll say.
but i wasn't sure you'd come.
none i'd like to share.
what?
really?
i also need someone who can read and write.
no, i--
don't worry.  you'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  we can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone. that's what  we'll try for. what about you?
i'm afraid you're blocking my view.
damn, jackie, i was just playin' with you.
pups. bitches. from three to twelve months.  trained and untrained ones. white and brown ones. you understand?
tim, i'll come back for you.  i'll get lex out first.
are you o.k.?
anonymous.  probably nothing.
what pay-check? you ain't done nothing!
she's going to cook something for us?
you are what...?
yes, i know what they make it out of, so what?  it's food now.  <u>you're</u> eating it.
so what's going on?  who's lou again?
well, when i walked up the block, i ... well, my word!
what was that, sir?
hey wizard.
don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
i like quiche.
i told you! i won't apologize for who i am.
never would've guessed.
i go up on missions. listen captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
thanks.
yes!
we try to be decent.
i'm real sorry.  in a while, you're gone from this country. but we live here.  no one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
so, how's it going today?
oh yes.
then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.
are you outa your mind? if i come out, i'll lose the title.
what's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
no.
gee, i'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  whaddya want?
yeah, just --
i'll go right after it.
mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  don't make me wait another day.
well, i am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or i suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
layton! oh shit!
yeah, but how do we get to them?
vegetables.
i want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
scared of a girl?
what'd i say?
just like on tv.
so then miles walks straight into the creative director's office and says "the code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
what do you want -- ?
perfect for a swim, isn't it?
that was two days ago. frankly, i think this place is a bit boring. it's all white. why doesn't the guy put up some posters? maybe some bullfight things . . .
oh you!
what's wrong?
i'm a girl.  i'm a girl.  i'm a girl -
good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
oh come on, that's ridic -
yes.
sorry, kitty! i'll be right back after i choke my monkey.
ten million dollars. ten mi -- you cheapskates! i've just wiped out the stock market. i've cost you billions!  i want ten million and one.
all set for what?
i'll get it.
he was just having fun.
hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. but this wasn't murder it was an accident-
jeffrey told her last night.
yes. that's kind of how it was.
oh! stop talking as if we were married!
sometimes yes, sometimes no. the staff usually forgets.
this ain't the time, richard.
you don't understand. it's already in you.
you need help.
what did you want to happen?
you never even took the shot. you couldn't do it. theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner.
if i could have anything... this would almost do.
of course, he's in the lineup. there he goes right there. hey, babe...!
don't ask me.  the guy's completely out to lunch.
whatever.  you still need a second to tend to your things.
eddie murphy.
what, you think i just dried up and blew away when you left? the world does turn once in awhile brian, even without your permission.
exactly.
pardon me?
they lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. i looked in, an' it was turning gray. i couldn't stand it. i went into radio school.
really? do i get to know where i'm going? it makes packing so much easier.
yeah, well he's still here. i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, i know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
who?
okay... 
very good, doctor.  i've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
yes, there was.
for what?
arghhh! oh!
huh-huh....you son of a bitch!
we've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. that's how we learned your languages. lately, we've been getting your television also.
two bits.
if i had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
be careful.
just open the door, please.
yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
no ma'am.
the biggest. the biggest movie you've ever dealt with, lee. we're talkin' a lot of film. a man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. and lee, you're no idiot.
..."and i won't never tell about the money."
bork! you are a federal agent. you represent the united states government... never end a sentence with a preposition. try again.
i don't know.
you said you had it all lined up.
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
he wanted to see me again.
i drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: guinness.
i enjoy it. does that make me some kind of pervert? just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
so man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
i know you faith.  you're afraid of something.  what's going on?
why?
hurt you, you sonofabitch? i could kill you.
i got seared.
that's got nothing to do with it... you're so beyond my comprehension i can't even discuss it with you.
good.
which do you recommend?
anger, fear, aggression!  the dark side of the force are they.  easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  beware, beware, beware of them.  a heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
it's queens, dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--i gotta live in manhattan to be a player, dad. there's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. one day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
on my way.
you don't want me here --
what's she like?
i think he owes more to you.  but that's not important now.  i know what's going on between you two.
look what you did! you stupid sonofa-
it's more than that.
oh, my god.
i remember..
you got a letter from mom.
don't touch him jamie!
you never thought that's a heavy load?
that's scary sounding.
when is it?
sorry to barge in on you. anybody else here besides you two?
you do.
they asked me to help.
really?
i'm sorry, about this...
i did?
you're talking about a man in a white beard again.  you're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  human beings look for causes and patterns.  how could we know what solaris is up to, if anything?
she's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of edgar sonrisa's managers.  you know who sonrisa is?
what do you want?
oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
listen, kirkhill.  i'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... i thought i'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  unless you have an objection.
and his age?
you got the shit?
my friend li mu bai.  he's given it to sir te as a gift.
this ain't the time.
you have to help me.  you will understand.  and no, you're not dreaming.  do you know where we are?
do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
well, what's the matter?
yeah, like...
no, no... i'm just so tired, and lost, and... i didn't realize what i was doing!
that's it!
a couple of hours.
your mind is just twisted enough. i believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
it's a flat tire.  that's all.
well, i...
delighted, sir.
what?
i couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. it's bad luck.
so does debbie.
me?
no.
you will honor your promise to me!
aw, come on jerry. we've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
how the hell do we get him down. from there?
that's where they keep them.  you want me to bring the tooth out here?
the one you gave me in the metro.
yeah. hold this. it might be safer.
hold on.
we just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in england as well?
not at all.
so do i.  but don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
we'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
blue five, does that glare bother you?
yeah!  next time i tell you i'm not hung up...!
formaldehyde.
would you get that, dear?
yes.
they've started the battle without me!
how could i be so stupid? you'd think i would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
yes?
they scare me too sometimes.
shit.
uh, jim?
freddie miles. you know -- he's organizing the cortina skiing trip.
what do you mean?
no.  i didn't.
right first time.
no, i couldn't get my hands on one.
maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
"nothing but net."
and there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
i've never sent a letter like that, you know?  i mean, i felt like i wanted to tell you something, but i didn't put it in the letter, and i didn't say it, but i want to say it now, i'm not sure if i should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but i think that i mean it, so, um, i just wanted to tell you...
the same. from what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. and they've taken hostages.
he didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
nobody's saying cancel. i'm talking about modifying.
-- transmit now!
hey --
you're a moron, you know that?
marietta, settle down now darlin'... i want what's best for her, too - like i said, i'll do what i can to bring her home.
it's an honor.
yeah kay, i'm here.
he has given up.
i don't know -- am i?
i haven't done anything.
chicolini, you've come just in time. we need a man who's fearless, brave. a man who's willing to die, if necessary.
that sounds like horseshit.
please... no.
if you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
it's a heart attack.
how 'you gonna live?
i mean i've been with a lot of girls i know.
that's not my ring.
how?
no!
but they're not here yet.  tell me about <u>you</u>.
of course.
you call that a compliment?
he didn't say, sir. i told him i didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
next time tell her i've gone away.
i don't know. who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york?
i don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
nope. if you're a criminal you don't carry id, and if you do you're a damn fool.
i don't think so.
why should they call us back?
be sensible - tell major calloway.
static!
i can't hardly believe it.  it's working out just like you said, wyatt.  we're lootin' this burg six ways through sunday.
curing countless diseases, not just ours.
no.  i paid him off.
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre.
that jelly you were talking to right here?
i can't eat before a game.
a friend wrote me.
we'll meet you at the inn.
you thought i was faking?
i didn't know she belonged to anybody.
you treat me like i was.
butcher's hook.  look.  i don't much reckon those minders of his.
me? no. don't want none either. such bastards, man.
plank?
it wasn't only that--ned was in a jam.
no, but we can.  we can do it together. spirit and guts, chief.
thank you.
she's bringing stargher into hers.
who is on this committee?
lieutenant  quinn.
danny, what makes you think you know all this?
pretty much. you know, george, wish we could send harry to college with you. your mother and i talked it over half the night.
that's the code word.  i miss you, peaches.
what the hell are you guys doing here?
why are you doing this to me?
and he still sits there?
self-realization. ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
i don't know what you're talking about.
oh, jim, that's beside the point. this boy's different. he's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. we can't do this to him.
your too good for this town, buddy.
told me what?
you said you didn't trust it.
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
tell me what?
you're not a permanent part of her life.  you're a distraction.
with pay!
hey, baby, what's happening?
he was just doing his job.
you do?!
i know, dad.
why, yes, of course.
we need milk....
hey, ben. thanks for coming down.
not a chance. it's too nice a night.
well, get me and chris a drink then.
are you sure?
created?
they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
i saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... mikey loved it. made me promise to get him one. will you live on the boat?
spock, don't call me admiral. don't you remember: you used to call me jim... now what's your question?
that's really funny.
selfish! but they get a chance at happiness. can't i have that chance?
a woman eh? i see.
yes. elsie taggart was the midwife.
right.
we'd appreciate your cooperation.
i think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
it's cracked -- and you never use it. and it's too ornate. i'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
monkeybone...!?
donna, you are such a crack up. you don't even like mike. is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
i haven't been briefed on any such thing!
then it's going to be 'i killed for sex'... listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. you haven't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
what?
you shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- i don't know -- you're different.
i do apologize.    a student had a crisis.
else.
listen, if you'll promise not to do it, i'll pay you. i'll pay you as much as he will. you won't gain anything by giving me away as long as i'm willing to make it worth your while. i've got to get to new york without being stopped. it's terribly important to me. i'd pay now, only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes. i'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york.
yes, very.  and very married.
he walked right up to me in church. at the holiest time of the wear. he approached me in a sanctified place.  kill him now.
a man in love, completely shaken. he sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
you will what?
well, it's true, isn't it? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. what do you think?
i don't have all day.
so what happened?
not for me.
the best commercial director in the business.  i hail you.
why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  they were wedged in tight.  they couldn't get a grip on them.  they would have had much more strength pushing on them.
what is she...
what?
of course.
and what about the exorcist? any ideas?
what's got into that cat?  well if you do see him, tell him i've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
do you have any idea what this means, simone?  our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
please.
not collapsing, honey.  it's closing!  this is no cave ...
nobody in america eats fish in the am. we're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
she could be out.  she could be sick in bed for all we know.
how's your dad?
you can let go.
hey! you don't know me --
how many you need?
oh, hello, dad.
er, my check, please.
oh, yes, i heard you all right. $20,000,000. that's quite a lot, isn't it?
what a headstrong fellow! well -- i guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
that's ok. we can call and reschedule in the morning.
well, once you're inside, it's nice.
so who... who’s the man? where is he?
i know, i know...
no, eve. i'm not related to basil and perdita.
i'm so sorry.
does she know where she's going?
the matrix formed in a day. the life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. can i cook or can't i?
there isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - what's wrong - don't you like my tea?
 yeah.
what d'you think i mean, kitten? i forgot, that's what i mean.
no.
yes.
it was the room of the husband. or of the husbands, i should say. madame has been married three times.
like mamooli's country...
get more men up there!
what?
it was.
leave her alone.
yes, sir!
yes.
it's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
oh, you come to see doctor lady?
okay.
four goddamn days.  this is going nowhere...
will you let me talk to you, please?
thanks.
goodbye, harry.
victory is mine.  i thank thee o lord that in thy ...
you men shoot, aim for the white meat!
it's mother, sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. do it!
about how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
money.
m'm, wait, i got a great idea.  hang in there for a second. i got a little-little artifact. a little erotic artifact, that-that i brought up from the city, which i think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  i just... there... there's a little old new orleans... essence. now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. there, now there.  m'mmm. m'mmm. hey, is something wrong?
oh, i think you will.
you fucked it?
that's right, shel.
don't fuck around. you're gonna get us all killed.
yes, bob.
i'm your friend.
no, it's awful.  oh my, it's awful.
government work.  had my own think tank.  got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  seen plenty of it too.  so will you if you stick around.
yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
i just saw the mayor, he said anything we...
we got to get out of here.
send for my car...
and i'm arranging deportation papers.
christy.  christy van cartier.
and i'm tellin' you it ain't! now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
what for?
is it the shakedown hon? you picked a loser, i just don't have it.
oil can?  oh -- oh, here it is!
she's my sister and my daughter!
yes.
same to you.
well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
bang-bang ... you're dead.
yankee poodle.
oh, yeah. hey, little fellow –– you worry me. you got someplace to sleep?
i'm sorry about that.  really.  but --
ruby mcnutt. my one true love.
oh, honey.
fuck pets. is this your partner? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again. fuck everything else. is this her?
oh.
sounds fair.
what can we do against them?
got me.
rio isn't the capital of brazil. it was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.
mother, i promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. once i get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named gallagher—
more than that. i believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
and, i'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
all right -
yes. unfortunately it's bullshit. the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
yes, but, joe, <u>joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "thoughts," about...
they're not open yet?
well, it worked, and i will not let you fail.  you are jerry ma- fuckin-guire.
gardiner, yes, sir.
anamaria!  have you seen gibbs?  i need to put together --
good. i'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. i hate that motherfucking house and --
are you jorge?
i could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
i'm...inside you.
how about rapacious and love- starved?
not too quickly.
the documents. the photos! the tapes! the evidence.
i've got what i want.  turn around baby, look at me.  look at your man.
all right, all right! you've got a ship!  but where do we go from here?  they probably took her to find the hidden bases... i don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  the empire has already beat us out.
maybe. but i think the yellow man is on drugs. i think frank supplies him.
welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  load that gun!
you have to see the words. try to build a mental picture of the script. imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
it's what i'm countin' on.
well -- you sent for me.
two weeks from tomorrow.
did you see the winning run score?
that's okay.  i love you anyway.
of course not! i'm a wanderer!  i'd like to go somewhere i've never been!
on the contrary, it matters a great deal.  we're engaged in immensely important research here.  i'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
what?
that's not your tape.
let me come in.
okay— i'll tell him i couldn't bring you in. ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. jump out, quick, and keep going... and god help you from here on in.
its too late.
did you really put her liver in the mailbox? i hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
not really, no.
i was?
hot?  i'm freezing my ass off.
why, didn't they say?
i am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
cute, evan.
competence.
this can't be.
no -- you can't go! something awful's happened. they've got short round and i think indy's been --
how will they come at you?
another little drop'll never do you any harm.
she will, mr.  laloosh, she will ...
hey!  pipe tobacco!  i'm going to need all of this! this is swell!
i admit he is very clever. three times he slipped through our fingers. in paris he continued his activities. we intend not to let it happen again.
thanks for the advice dad.
and i'll just shitkick in my usual way.
yes.
she's a very groovy girl. that's the problem.
you didn't think so then.
sal, get 'em in the vault.
shhh!  don't do that!
they're gonna die in there!
morning. any calls?
about the baby.
yes, i have mine.
no, i'm a different person now, harry.
well, *picking* them is! it's about as exciting as... walking!
go on. go on send the telegram.
don't you live at home?
what is tir asleen?
they've got my amado.
otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you. tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  right, otis?
i don't know what to do.
yeah, ray, he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines' jet went down last month.
anderton --
luke.
he's here, isn't he?  do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
i don't know. like i said, she's not my father's case.
what?  what was that crazy bitch said to him?  there's a war on, man! people are being killed!
"wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day> it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
no. thanks anyway. i've got to get over to the office.
is he an enemy?
if it were only that simple, my young friend.  read on, gentlemen. read on.
thelma kinda took to him.
if you knew why, you might know where to look for him. i don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  now, i've done what you asked me.
what could i do?  if she insisted, i had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  i threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
you would have done that?
this is usda prime, largely available, beef.  with no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
mr. gilroy --
we're under investigation now.  back in seattle.  hap wanted to talk.  as soon as we got back.  thought he could work out some kind of deal.
andy, stop! i think he can help you - 
no. no. get carol.
ellie...ellie...what...
oh, for god's sake...here.
that's why i joined this band. safety first.  anything to get away from those bums.
"the wrong hands"? we're not talking about military secrets, john. they're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
jack!
no.  on the phone.
well, mr. feldman, some people have resumes to show.  i've got my own movie.
i don't need a gun. where is it? if it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
eduard wanted to marry me.
oh, personal stuff. look! i hit one!
oh, leave me alone.
so let's do it.
standard vig.  minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
colonel kurtz, he's dead.
sure.  take it easy, dude--i know that you will.
sorry?
i like it to be what it is. it's sarah. that's a biblical name. you want to know its meaning?

no! do as i say.
he's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. he'll be in soon.
yeah? and what are you going to do tonight?
not to mention my men who lost their lives.
carl, do you know?  like on a map...
thank you.
we've certainly been in some swell jams.
exactly! i speak seven languages, including hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. how about you? kill somebody?
okay, number 23's full.
likewise.
but i never said rudy.
it's not too late to show her you're sorry.
why did you change your name?
let me tell you a story. there's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. the young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
well, if she looked like you -- say! my brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
yes, david...
i'm sure i can come up with something.
i shouldn't have put you through that. it must have been agony. let's do something.
aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
our mistake.  but what does it matter; it was our money.  we don't even expect thanks.
what of it?
seven.
don't play simple with me, jake. you want me to spell it out for you? i'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
i'm fine, thank you.
wha-at?
look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. que sera-sera.
tide doesn't turn for three hours.
it's a whale out there.
you're such a pal to understand. it's as if marge is here now -- i look at you and i see her face -- and i can't, whatever i'm feeling towards you -- i just can't...
youíre wrong about one thing.  iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
yes!!!  you know, people ask me, "doctor, why are you always happy?" and i tell them it's mind over matter.  i don't <u>mind</u> that i don't <u>matter</u>!  do you get it?  do you get it?
i mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
will you shut up and play.
make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
why was it you never took her by force?
oh. uh. commencing diversion.  alarm in cosmetics.
shit!
what am i, earl?
again?! jesus!
can i smoke?
you got my back.
"the sting."
suspended from school, my mother??
no. i just think... anything can be explained. but mary, doing a thing like this... i don't know how to handle...
i don't understand.
thank you.
gee, would you, mr. webster? honest?
what goddamn right do you have to take him?
it's kind of ironic. all you guys have women troubles and i don't.
boss, let's get out of here.
sir, there's something else... a transat relay.  just came through.
really?
what signal?
how come you didn't close your eyes?
you better believe it.
i know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. like us.
do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
one job i'd never take is working around electricity.
i couldn't do it.  how did i get here?
exactly. and i bet she's ugly. real ugly. otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
"perfect"?  mr. wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
exactly.
since this morning.
who's this?
i appreciate your cooperation. i'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, denise willis... have you seen her?
right.
then i suggest you call one of them.
damnit, where's my car!
you thought i was some fucking jerk?
i'm not alone.
sorry, i didn't know.
not too protracted, i hope.
well, in my prayers, i realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  god would never allow anything like that to happen.
look at the bottom of the screen. you see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  click on that... twice.
the britons.
we?
what difference does it make?
look, it's  simple.  just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
merry christmas, son.
really?
i'm not sad, no, i owe the captain my life. it's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. it's a lot more fun to punish crime. then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a warrior for. you just want the kicks. the rush.
may i stay then?
no, i'm good, angelo.
bullshit.
no ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
you believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
i'll see.
you don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
i suppose so. she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but i don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... i guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
come on!  i won't tell.
you work that out with la senora.  you will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the malaysian ship.  for collection in north miami.  you warehouse it. release it when we say.  i'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
no, see, clem, i assume you fucked someone tonight. isn't that how you get people to like you?
are you finished?
he didn't say anything to me about it.
when you find the guy, you'll know.
see.  there.  what'd i tell you?
hey, darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
yes. i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place.
only the wet ones.
speaking of the vacant post.
no, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  hello, hello. is taylor there?-- governor hopper. quickly, please--
yeah, actually i do.
sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
i've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
what do we do?    lean into it.
you felt obliged to.
mother . . .
... i get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --i get this expert doctor to talk to you.  i'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  you're 'sposed to be in court.  i bet you haven't even seen the file.
go ahead.
bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to harry.
here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
yes.
that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
he did it to make you stay with him!
yeah...seems to.
why?
...why?
oh?
oh, jesus. look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
more like jenny is after every man she sees.
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
great!  because, otherwise i'll erase your ass.
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth's relationship?
never.
uh-huh.  anyway, i'm thinking easter, 'cause i just fucking love pastels.
and you, sir? any better?
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
worse.
i'm checking in. barton fink.
just go over to gelford and up to vista. it's not far. can you tell me any more about what you learned?
listen to what?
smokey three: thumbs up, am i right?
this is bullshit - we donít even know what max looks like.
i told you --
mexico?  you're going to mexico?
honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
so, the doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
no!!!
this your present address?
not at all.
possibly.
good deal. lois just wants to hear it from micheal.
you didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
it will take a little time, but i'll order a search for your papers. though it does raise a disturbing issue.
that's what we're here to find out.
go down there and kill everybody, i guess.
in the past.  a girl.  maybe... a magyar peasant.  an indian princess. a slave.
yeah. let's do that.
uh, no. maybe you should try the lido deck.
that's hard to believe.
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
listen, i'm just as nervous as you are.
no. but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. the balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
isn't that like waiting and seeing?
well...dammit, if i'm doing this, how the hell am i gonna watch?
then what do you suggest big shot?
wrote the...?
frank and me have to go away for a while.
but you fellas never get a break, do you?
son of a bitch. they knew each other.
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
none of them had any --
we had a deal. remember that?  he said if it didn't work out between us, that i could get my things and i could leave.
austin, i have something for you as well.
hearts and kidneys are tinker toys! i'm talking about the central nervous system.
then what brings you out on such a night?
i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it's such a shame.
i've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
where's he from?
that's okay.  he's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
--i'm not staying here!
dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
no.
lay it on me.
no one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  this world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
smashing!
just remember: they think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
fine. fine.
audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
does he love you?
i'll know when i find it.
this gonna take long?
i wish i could believe that.
you sound so disapproving, midge.
hang on...  remember that cessna we saw at the pumping station on the haul road?  belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
she's with her grandmother. she's with steph's mom. she spends a lot of time over there. steph's... well, she's stephanie.
there's no need for language, mr. hockley.  go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
i'm asking what you're here for.
yeah, yeah, sure.
i ain't gonna shoot her.
you better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. and if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. if they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. if they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
hi wendy.
three more chapters to go.
fucking sully! look at you!
the soho grand?
well, javier rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
let's find out.
yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
goodnight.
i believe you -- so what happens now?
don't start acting hurt.
you talked about it?
how high up does this...arms dealing go?
what's that?
it was a dreadful, heavy thing.  i only wore it this once.
you can't remember that -- !
that's right. three percent.
you have a good time?
are you trying to insult me?
you mean ray dunbar? well, that ain't right.
actually, you're just in time.  admiral roebuck: you know commander bond, don't you?
you were married?  all those falls, i'm surprised you had time.
toward the pole!
so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
i don't think so. she'll want larry first.
y'what?
then how do i know this is your office?
you're goddamned right, i give the order.  vote!  jesus christ!  listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?
it doesn't make a difference!  i have to move out!
i thought you'd be pleased.
i don't understand.
hey, lowell.
really, "the freeman centre"?
you're backstage at the encore of creation.
blow me.  yellow means go, kimberly.
two at nine? perfect.
you're no bargain either, pal.
i don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. see, when you beat one of these things... 
i like to think so! it's this little idea i been working on!
frank?
do you think lother could have seen it?
he likes to read...  did he mention anyone in particular?
is that so?
they were all gonna jump me back there.  what ever happened to one against one?
accident.
that's not going to help.
well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  and i'm expecting you won't mention it again.  i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  what are you, his shadow?  do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  you know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with w.p.  that means without you.  okay, pal?  let's eat.
i was once. richard!? richard norvik? i didn't recognize you.
meaning?
oh, how are you, baxter.  they keeping you busy these days?
so?
excellent! excellent! my boy, i'm convinced our state has a great debt of gratitude to you--
how?
and i'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
he's a mean dude. i've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. he knocked out his teeth... blood... he was just like boom, boom, boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. he's a nice guy though.
well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.
no! no!
the money would go to frank.  the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
i'll get her.  have a good christmas, matt....
you know who it is.
you need a table.
how long have you been together?
no. what i mean is -- that's why i've been acting this way. i'm not like this. i hate myself like this.
this isn't a request.
that's it then.  finler, mcwhirter, dietz, and perry.  jesus.
then what brings you back?
you're all kidding yourselves. even with top of the line crypto.  cray access. stu 3's --
why bother?
maybe not, but why take chances?
nah i think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. i just hope none of us end up dead.
who knows? if dr. darling is right, you should watch out.
i don't know the details of the treaty, sire, marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau.
what's her name?
i don't know. we'll find out.
well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
yeah. okay. listen carefully ...  you're in the bathroom.  you've been shot in the shoulder ...
for how long?
thanks.
i feel hardly nothing.
it excites him. most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
i don't remember.
yeah. i feel real up to it right now. come on, david lee, you and me'll do the loading.
i checked the place out.  there weren't no dicks in there.
orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
come closer then, jack, that i might give you proper thanks.
what's with you?
i stole your beat, huh? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
it needs a more object-oriented language. this doesn't scale, does it?
if she don't want you, she don't get anything.
that's right. i'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. we gotta deal?
hey.
no way.
i understand. i'm just real curious like you said.
howard!
please!
your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
how can i?
well, what did you want?
no, i was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
if!  if there's a treasure.
sid. you must be a very important executive.
no.
god forbid!
leave then, some friend you are.
you’re not going to get away with this.
and you're gonna die after me, right?
that's great work, hildy... huh? oh, will you stop worrying about the money? i'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
no...
very funny.  i saw you out there on lane five. what do you have the flu or something?
word wit'cha. in private.
no, that's not mr. taylor.
we cannot defeat this --
is he nice?
why, mrs. brenner?
already.
i'm part of the game, just like you.
they... are in opposite directions, sir...
you've done well by yourself.
she was, wasn't she? how long has this been going on? do you know?
i'm not really a musician.
come on--let's parole 'em.
i know.
buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  you got yourself a little playmate, huh?
he meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
no. ...came down on one of my boats. they could have been after the fish, just as you said.
the least i could do for you, deanna.  besides, you know me... i’m a talking head.
that's what i said.
well, i liked you.  you were a deejay, and i thought you were hot, and i didn't have a boyfriend, and i wanted one.
i know what you're saying, man. i don't know what to tell you...
tell me what to do, carl.  i need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  i'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with.  i won't do it.  i want our life back.
where's turley?
carl, i'm running late.  i'm coming right now --
i don't know...
what! not ol' honest abe!
jacob, i don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. i don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. i don't believe in enternal damnation. i don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. we don't need them. we do a good enough job on ourselves.
hey, okay.
well, what the hell, i got nothing better to do.
drop begins... now!  fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  five. three.  two.  one kilometer and slowing.  lock tractor beams.
i told you, all bets are off.
well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but i've been putting it off.
vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
tapert's got nothing to do with this.  he came here to get his palm read.
easier than that, jack.  screwball!  fetch me down a couple of them plates.
well, you shouldn't drink. are you gonna drink?
but you're not married.
no. you're very well-protected.  no one can find our where you are.
i certainly did, sir...
my diagnosis is messed in the head. a poor little rich girl -- i mean check out the jeans and fur look. and lend your ears to this brutality. like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to switzerland to ski over thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
that's right. there's no place left to go is there, james?
you're no longer an extra -
if you have to work...
okay, call them. fine. oh-- and if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
what is all this? when are you coming home?
ronnie...
that's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! hello...?
i'll quit, maybe you should start.
"i'll go out with you." now go get me these old newspapers...
maybe... i... don't...
are those for me?
what do you want with her?
i'm not gonna forget it. what does that mean? if you've got a plan, i think i have a right to know about it. i told you my plan.
there's something wrong with every single place we look at! why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
would you hold on just a minute here, please? look, there's no reason to panic now. epps saw somebody. fine. it's a big boat.  chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. if we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  the gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. like i said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
but i am a captain.  if i were not a captain, i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which i am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
have to wait.
even that could be a trick. you escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
jesus, just what i need, another blue flamer.  johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
you're not a woman.
how did you meet?
well, i spoke with mr. hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  no more test cases. he was only too happy to oblige.  don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  you'd be up way past your bedtime.
--we got twenty minutes to deadline--
rose, please listen. whatever you want to do, i can help you.
your mother got a brother--alphonse--
robert, grace isn't adjusting to school. and she can't sit in this apartment all day... i think it would be good for her.
what?!!
a man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
because i don't like you.
wednesday next. frank looks across the room at jack.
i'll answer anything.
you try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. this is some new form of torture. say it, brother, sir.
arf... you gotta help me.
...just beautiful.
all right, wise guy. go ahead. spill it.
no, what is it?
who did?
harmful, like -- how?  what would you get?
whatta you mean? you're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
<u>negative</u>, golitsynís on the move.
charles...
well, how about hypnosis? that can't hurt him!
yeah.
not that tunnel, the other one!
i did what i thought was right.
what do you mean, you poor ham! this is new year's!
montana.
all right... i want you... to... kill... sailor... as simple as that.
you're working late.
gosh! you see sir--i was fixing some plaster for a cast on amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. i'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
i was the more deceived.
i was never politically correct enough for comrade dowd.
that's the only reason, period. they only want one certain kind of black comic.
he uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  singular.  not can't move us.
ext. dam - day.
now, i saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
yes... but -- how...?
mom.
buff, can you listen to me for a second?
just as the freighter comes through? isn't that quite a coincidence?
oh well... you know me.
it's okay, rose. you can go with him.
beginning of what?
i think we wait right here.
an ode to spring. are there one or two "t's" in bloodletting?
what's the...
thanks, ardelia.
forgive me, father.  for i have sinned.
christ, twenty seconds, christ!
yeah, maybe.
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. want to know what it's really like? it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. glamorous, huh?  and the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
you sure?
bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
you do?
chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
toasty.  were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
did he say anything else about her?
i don't wanna take your money, mr. masry.
i mean tomorrow or the next day.
don't you worry. we'll get some action.
i know...
what the fuck is going on?
so what? so who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
-you'll have to deal with it, nigel.
what happened with the tape?
val!  val!
it's simple, alan.  we send the vice- president to africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `president' to nominate a new one.  the whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
recording, sir.  we see you perfectly.
who the fuck knows?  we'll find out soon enough.
can you believe how perfect it fits?
why what?
you were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. it's tight as a drum.
it's a free country, you can think anything you want.
it must have been safe.
i know but we're in a bind.
just go! i've a feeling he's right behind us!
man, you're livin' dangerously. let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
yes.  no, wait -- let's go crazy -- i'll have an orange juice.
claire:  as an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  stay with me.  i need you.  we start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  stay.  stay.  tonight...when...  when they've gone.  let's talk.  let's <u>really</u> talk.  we could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
why don't you watch?
nicholas...
sure.
for?
i was offered that job as a waitress.
how do you know? huh? when nobody knows that much?
not a chance.
out where?
there's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this catwoman prowling around. we can always dine at the mansion, if..
who gives a shit what he calls himself?
it's three weeks in florida -
and who is "they?"
stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
why not? why the fuck not?
sure thing. put them here... i'll take them.
you're saying no.
well what would you call him.
your brother's here.
you won't have to.
now you've fallen into his trap. when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! lord have mercy!!
he also happens to be the most talented man i've ever known.
what's going on?
what then?
so i'm gonna act!  ever since i can remember i've wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
why?
i like him a lot.
maybe you didn't, but i'm here to find out about a disturbance. some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
nigger, fuck me hard!
is what you?
that beynon's got a long arm.
who are you guys?
oh, goody. i'm so pleased. i'd clap if i could.
be kind to her. she loves you so much.  in a perfectly proper way, of course.
may i ask what this is regarding?
she's lying.  she lost the first one on purpose.
i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
what do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? want to walk to new york? you know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in bedford falls.
cops? you mean they nabbed those cruds?
i love you, conner.
now, come on -- you know i'm not ready for that kind of --
ohio...
you will have to make all the jokes, because i'm going to be very serious.
did you stay here last night?
to be frozen.  to never change.  a life of perpetual ice-olation. there is little perfection in that.
mr. dean--
that's right.  practice makes perfect. i'm practicing to have a baby right now. if we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
okay, kent, call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home. favoring clark -- happy now, he turns to leave the office. shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
shut up.
i hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
george bailey.
if this is some sales pitch i'm not buying --
how can i act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
and isn't there a movie in the works about you?
then what are you stopping for?
is he dead?
no. she's dead!
well we can't talk in here.  they're having the place painted.
no.
we did not.
next week "east lynne."
why?  because they're stupid. "where were you last night..."
i can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  i can give her the brush ...
start at the beginning. page one, the first one. here --
and did you?
mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. he wanted to know where she was.
oh, no, man. i can't.
- guilty.
but what if...?
yeah, i talked to your mom. i think i woke her up. i hope i didn't get you in trouble.
what is it you want?
in the envelope in my pocket.  my right.. jacket..pocket..
if we could send a distress signal...
but you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
well.  considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
you really ought to look at this, linda. there's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. it's like school.
in light of this lurid tale, i don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
run the subscription list...
stop acting like a silly little fag!
oh, look, mr. hogan, i'm really sorry about what happened in there. really--
no.  were you going to you?
come in, alfredo.
what did the lord tell you, ike?
you're more gutless than i thought.
i wouldn't.  he'll be back.  if you want him.  the cute brutal type with handcuffs.  very sexy.
please.
destruction of their local weather systems. i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air.
i would not presume to debate you.
you better believe it, you sweet little thing. you better believe it...
honeythorn gump, is it?  i've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
i know ...
you ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
there must be some way to get it up there.
you be quiet, frank, we're talkin'. the adults are talkin'. were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
that's what i heard.
are you ok?
i want you to stay with me.
i love you.
that's okay. that's his style.
i lost my job...
he kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  he showed me.  i visited a few times.  then one of jonas's guys visited.  when i arrived, your dad was dying.
just put your mask on.
...dat's too much money.  i can't 'ford it.  i needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
no... i've got to go to mr. underhill...
hasn't moved for twelve hours. go on. have a heart.
you take care too, bobby.
because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. this is standard horror movie stuff. prom night revisited.
and what happens when these guys stop paying?  sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  then where are we?
you see, i wanted to surprise them.
you want me to tell you it's your fault? it probably is. what are you going to do about it?  i thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
may i have the surgeon's name, please?
would you be willing to have dinner with me?
no. i'm not. why should i ?
how the hell did he get away?
it's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. now granted that's what "true blue" is about, no argument about that.
so you can't tell me anything?
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
you'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
okay, stop back by. don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
some other time, cobb. some other time.
then let him go and he'll follow you.
possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  it's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem.
my fault.
what do you mean?
didn't you feel the house rock? you must have seen all those shell bursts.
we have to go in the basement.
brady! come with us.
the guy! the priest! the mummy!
'you're sorry and i'm sorry.'
it sounds strange, and i'm going to be very wary.
it's eating a hole in the floor!
well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as i can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
'he'?  whom do you mean-
she's tied to me, r.l.. we tied to each other.
billy, how are you?
tch, no!  we were, we were both going in different directions.
never mind it? that's not my money! that's bruce's money!
best game in the world.
come with me, honey.
how often do you use cocaine?
i'm not sure.
pretty old.  i'll be twenty-two in august.
i would have been laughed right out of xenia.
it's just -- i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. create something...
can i get you anything?  food?  cake? watered down champagne punch?
four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...  ... including the green dragoons under tarleton.
tremoille... don't.  please...
now he's got no ears! you happy, nicky? your father's got no ears!
no! i will not! this is nuts! i'm leaving! i mean it...this is nuts.  this is too nuts...i'm leaving. i mean it!
it makes me sick to see him like that.
well i'm so glad that you guys are.
he took the secret with him when i dropped him.
exactly. so on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a black mass style of desecration in the church.
i don't want to hear about it.
no.
again?  how long before we start noticing the difference?
nicole...
-- what?
so are you engaged, or what?
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
no.
will they consider this a violation of his probation?
sh--sh--i want to have a few words with you quietly.
you know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. that's the thing, romeo.
i thought it was a nice place.  isn't it?
yes.  yes, come with me!
no, a super girl.
something strange is happening. and whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
because, my dear ricky, i suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
in a pasha's harem, majesty. a seraglio.
claudia: why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
all well and good -- but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
i knew it!... i knew it!...
did you do it to me????
yes.
why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
"i guarantee that we'll have tough times.  i guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. but i also guarantee that if i don't ask you to be mine, i'll regret it for the rest of my life. because i know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
fine. how's your eye?
you want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
you know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
yoda spoke of another.
someone was at that window. i saw the curtain move.
and now?
about 250 million of your miles.
i recognize you from the news photographs, monsieur laszlo.
i d-don't think japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
saks.  if he knew you did that! they're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
that's news to me.  so it's over at jesse's office?
i'm just being honest. i just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
you didn't mind too much.
out in back.
no, i'm just restoring it to its normal state.
okay frank.
good luck, since i got the keys.
about 22 hours on site.
we've lost a colleague.  the comedian is dead.
so how is she?
seventy-seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler, did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay?
ken.  i'm in some trouble.  i need an attorney and you're the only one i know. so i figured i'd start here.
sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
and if i want to smoke, i'll fucking smoke.
i am. she is.
how soon can we get up and running?
<u>i'm.  the.  biggest.  sissy.  in</u>. <u>the.  wide.  world</u>.
travis, you haven't even played the record?
say it again.
get on the truck, tatiana.
that ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
what?... oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
coffee, that's a laugh. his belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
she didn't say she had no man.
how about art.
if we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. blow up right in our face.  ruby was just given a new trial.  if he has something to say, it'll be there. susie, what did you find out on oswald?
no.
don't say that -- i know it is --
what?
this is the president.
is it contagious? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
don't go wild, sidney.
it's alright.  i'm very happy for you.
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  i'm now going to even that score.  i'm going to break in his door and i'm going to smash his violin.
i lost a day of production.  i lost a worker.  i expect to be compensated.
the engines are fixed.
look, go home and...work on something. make another cat.
would you tell her bobby's here?
it's all right, finn.
yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
you think i don't know? you think i like to keep this inside? but i gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. it's disgusting what you have to put up with.
the female.
work harder. and get me some results. those black bastards could be up to anything.
forget them...
how many drinks have you had?
if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet--who might become cleopatra ... how would you start?
sure. especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
but how do you know?
come sit beside me, sweet boy, and i'll draw you a map.
where'd you get this?
when it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
what did he say?
they no longer live in tepees, mr. college graduate.
but why me? i thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. look at my father, look at us, i mean...
no. we're not stayin' --
you're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
it's only that ... it's all very odd, sir.
i just can't stand it any more! every minute of the day! do this! do that! i don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! we can't even have a fight! we don't have no privacy! everybody's miserable in our house!
so why am i still alive?
what can i tell you? it's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. those guys i worked with back in boston, they were a bad influence.
winston churchill.
in the old books. it's called a glaive.
oh.
dear me... i must be losing my finesse. if i'm not careful i'll be understood by everybody.
...well, then you ain't got much.
in a word: merk. exposed.
no, no. i just took it.
i'm gonna meet her in front of the beekman. i think i have a few minutes left. right?
i'm supposed to be running.
four o'clock.
you're not going to slow us down! keep moving!
to meet interesting people, improve myself. you wouldn't believe the losers we got over in port angeles.
with you there's a tragic dimension.
well, i might've found him again if i hadn't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
sure.
paper or cloth?
copy.  hal, tell gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
you see... i wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. you understand?
where did you get this material?
colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. to have strategy, ya gotta practice.  and to practice it, ya gotta play --
that's me.
i had to tell you in person.  because there's something else i need to say.
what?
where have you been staying?
you batted or you bunted?
how do you know she did that?
well, i should be in florida now! if carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and i'd be on my way to the keys. on my boat, relaxing with a glass of port!! re-ti red!
not much. nothing at all in this sector.
i have been patient and i've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
wait a minute. wait. whatiya want? for cryin' out loud!
baby laxative? we can't snort baby laxative.
the monitor! i never ask twice.
i do not know -- and even if i did...
perhaps.
all right.  if you can take back the sword in three moves, i'll go with you.
that'll solve all our problems.
what happened, kittle?  we used to be friends.  you used to know how the game was played.
you're mad, aren't you?
that's because you're soft. gimme the gun.
he's a virgin.
they always say that.
he's not here, mom.  woody's gone.
zorin must not have gotten instructions. somebody in their foreign ministry's blown it big-time.
well, i admire your optimism, and i just wondered if it was regional. you ever see any movie stars?
so?
everything.
i ain't blind, you asshole.
he had to leave early to be with his daughter.  she's getting a divorce.
i know.
i don't think we were the first.
no, immediately. the people are demoralized. leave this to me ...
day after tomorrow.
you had better manners as a pig.
you're so easy.
nice one.
you look like you lost your sheep ...
oh, uh, listen, david called me up.
you know who muhammad was?
here they are, then.
hey, you asshole! i want you to arrest me!
ahh, but i declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
he has to. that's predestination. if god is omniscient, if he knows everything -- and he wouldn't be god if he didn't -- then he must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
sounds like they make tennis rackets. what do we know?
you can holla y'self hoarse. ain't gonna bend my will.  right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  gonna suffer you like jesus say, to the faithless and the perverse generation.
okay.  take me to your leader.
yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
god, if chet found out he'd...
don't do anything rash, please, benedict.
i wasn't waiting for a bus.
they're not gone, they're here.
go back and tell dr. neilsen. have him report to the skipper.
listen, i do appreciate your concern, but--
we'll be waiting. over.
this was one sadistic motherfucker.
sure.  every bunco man in the country knows gondorff.
sure am.
you're asking me?  i don't even know how to load this thing.
whatever.
uh, i'm tom booker. your mother around?
it was crazy not to have destroyed them
that's trust.  mr. christian trusted me implicitly.
at what.
well, i've been thinking...  i didn't realize how much...talent walter actually had.  it would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  dead wrong.
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
no way.
but i see, she didn't mean old in years. you always carry an umbrella, bruce?
not very long.  there have been a couple of bids already.
nothing, i just hugged her back.
three o'clock.
this is bad public relations. i was planning to do a lot of business with you. but now i'm going to have to go elsewhere.
it was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
the whole city's together on this one.  we took a vote.  everybody's down on you, you know.
how much do i owe you?
yeah, me too.
through the sweats or not?
no - i've got a sweet-payin' job that i'm about to lose.
that was a great idea, shorty.
christ, i don't believe this!
yeah?
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of. face it, freedom failed.
hey, where y'at, frank?  you're wasting your time here.  big jim gave strict orders.  no fbi allowed.
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. we got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
yes...i'm uh...i'm fine.
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint. jesus, wes, i killed the iraqis in there.
you're not having a good time are you?
good.
no.  that's me talking.  and you know what?  it's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
exactly when?
i know you're cops, but i thought you were just here for that convention. i swear! all i wanted to do was clean up the room. i don't know anything about dope!
he's expecting my call.  i'm going to the station...  and i'm going to call him.
nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
she's a child.  she might panic. she doesn't know me.  she might not come to me.  she might just run.
what is this?
"forever".
now it's menopause. she's always hot. i gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. it's always something.
what, your virginity? well that's over now.
yeah.
takes one to know one.
no.
<u>listen</u>.
how about yourself?
let's move your ass in there!!
you think you're so slmighty -- smart -- who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
oh?  oh!
hey.
mike's out there.
yeah.
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
i'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. give me a month and i'll blow their movement wide open.
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings. they push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. we've taken to chaining ours together for safety. i'm aldys.
i'm going home, donny.
it's a secret.
what are you nuts? a debt is a debt. i was thinking i'd throw a little extra work your way. you know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
oh, what a chance! if i could just  --  get to him.
huh?
what's going on?
including killaine.
not disintegrating, alan -- digitizing. while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
oh boy... in the club, or at home?
they'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  that'll help.
fine? fine what?
temporarily.
and where'd you go?
here's the terminal.
he's my son.
i questioned joyce about all this...
well, i kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
there's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, charley. you made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
saddest thing i ever heard.
well, actually, mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with the marriage guidance council.
dwight. dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago.
nothing wrong with research.
fuck you. fuck you, pal. listen to you trying to pass the buck again. i'm the source of all your misery. who closed the store to play hockey? who closed the store to attend a wake? who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? you wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "i'm not even supposed to be here today."  you sound like an asshole. whose choice was it to be here today? nobody twisted your arm. you're here today of your own violation, my friend. but you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if dante wasn't here. well, i got news for you, jerk: this store would survive without you. without me either. all you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: you push fucking buttons. any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. you work in a convenience store, dante. and badly, i might add. and i work in a shitty video store.  badly, as well.  you know, that guy jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. us?  we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-god forbid- cigarettes. we look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  everything happens like it's supposed to.
'course you would. you belong here, my boy, not the snobby court. you could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! that's what people want, you know: fantasy. you do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because i've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. oh, and a few trick animals. you'd have to use those.
i liked it when you caught me fucking him.
i told you this was gonna happen.
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
the canines will be real. you'll taste real blood! god damit, david, please believe me! you'll kill and make others like me! i'm not having a nice time, david! don't allow this to happen again! you must take your own life!
yeah.  it bothers me when cops get hurt while i'm makin' a play. i don't like it.
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  and piss you off.
pearl and john.
you're, uh, you're minnesota fats, aren't you? you know, uh, they say minnesota fats is the best in the country out where i come from.
how was palm springs?
hey...
what position did you occupy?
you attacked me.
i doubt it! come on, ken.
what is this "i, i, i" stuff? you only talk about yourself? aren't you glad to see me?  don't i look nice?
i know, i need a keeper.
i can't.
i understand.
you saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
why yes. how did you know?
shooting me won't get you anywhere.
why wouldn't it?
he didn't recognize me. back off, willya? he didn't recognize me.
you know a guy named merle?
fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but jurek says they'll let him out.  this is disgraceful.
it's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
i came on at 8:00.
well, as i've said, we've heard about you. we are interested in your case. we want to help you.
i'm sorry, general, if i...spoke out of turn. it's just that...mr tyler is not here to defend himself. he has no representation. i don't believe due process is being served by...
why not?  just once.  a trial run.  what harm could it do?
i'll have to think about this.  i have to get back... i should go...
bob. i didn't...
elois?
yeah, tell me about it.
you might be a hired gun, vincent, but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
ohhhh --
perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
we keep them, in case the people come back.
are you kidding? tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
you're too quick for me.
two-hundred thousand dollars?  who wants a hundred dollars?
what are you gonna do? look at me, nicky! i got no legs, i got no hips, i got one ear...
what's that?
punk?
when was that?
him no white.  him no white.
loretta.
ok, so maybe i was a little over emotional.
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! once you left, she became a whole different person.
you know classical music?
can you just follow me? the back is full?
we're quoting mom again.
rescue mission.  there's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
i'm fucked!
i thought that was for when we were very very old?
oh yes. that's fine.
an explosion, just like paul's.
thank you.
jim--if i fling a party man like horace in the face of those angry committees--
clever.
"i will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
i'm very nervous.
perceptual?
mr. lime's.  accident...
what about ganz?
are you absol...
it gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
excuse me?
you want some too?
jah...
that's what i'm doin'!
oh yeah?!  well you're a monkey-shit-
it's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
i'm not suffering, you know. i don't give a shit.
he got away. i had him. he got away.
whatever.
is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
he's blessing the house.
i'm right here.
we're going to leave that up to detective williams. i'll tell you though, you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
don't just become excited.
yes, i will.
yeah.
you're being childish.
sure.
i'm sure he's matured since then.
tranq guns down, rifles up!
she didn't really say.
good, lenny.  i can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  come on.
it's a pleasure to meet you, faith.
sister marguerite i think.
of course it does.  obviously in denial.  maybe we can help.
i appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
w-we had a fight.  i called him... called him a name...
but, your majesty -
where is the subway station, please.
then what do i do?
that's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock!  like i said.
nice touch.  does the game use real bullets... ?
who are all these people?
no.  you're quite wrong.  right here's the seat of the trouble. mrs. holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  it's revived all their old superstitions -- zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
you do that, edward.
o.k. o.k. without the bird seed. what do you want?
they're good, norm, but you're better'n them.
truman?  it's me, marlon.  i need to talk to you.
on what?
does brumby get a kick out of that crap?
do you have any czech girls working for you?
i have a suggestion...
now you know what to watch for...
we don't have time, smith. in twenty hours we run out of air.
is it inside the city?
what about the guy on the very bottom?
uh-huh.
where's czech girl?
i'm sorry. i guess i'm just tired of hearing about mr. carpenter.  i don't like the way he's attached himself to you and bobby. after all, what do you know about him?
you'll take care of it?  not this time. no way.  i bought it fair and square. and we open tonight.
mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
what?
wow, hannah always swore you were working, but --
it's what you wanted isn't it?
you may go, captain charles.
california, huh?
and you believed him when he told you he had done that.
oh, thank you, sir.
i don't know.
i don't know. i don't want to find out.
"attitude adjustment issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  by letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
why would she be hiding from me?
well, i need to see this with an audience!
correct.  that's for you. keep it.
you consider your life easy.
you've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
hard to say.  i might have...some business here.
that's right.  the world is your oyster.
wouldn't happen to be the lincoln memorial, would it?
...from mavis, also.
what brain?
it's alright.
i know...  we're going to try and get in this way. i don't think you can make it.
right.  we're gonna run.  get ready.
i'm not trying to make trouble, roy. it's just, she's always so nasty to me, i thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. i saw her out there, and i called a friend of mine in baltimore, so now i know who she is.
perhaps.
seitz plastics. that's where he met my mom. she was a fry cook in the cafeteria. before that, she'd been a dancer.
there you go with that we again.
i was asked by my father to open neg-
no it's not okay. it's not.
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
just scratched my arm, why?
speakest thou from thy heart?
certainly not to me.
shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler... i like your chances a lot more.
we haven't build shit.  you're just tearing down your father.
jesus christ. not even close.
no.
john don't like him much.
goodnight, sweetheart.
that's a risk i'm willing to take. deep down, you're good.  even jade fox couldn't corrupt you.
no jeffrey!!
no, i do.
i don't know.  my friends...
you don't think it's tilted a little too much --
jesus, it's freezing!
would you like a tranquilizer?
dr. nebbleman, i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  the instant, understand?
not quite.  he did defense.  i'm a prosecutor...
they're liars and cowards.
don't ask stupid questions.  look at it.
no, you're right. you were hired to protect her, that's enough. i'm confident you'll do that.
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
possibly.  good.  well, would you be willing to accept the theory, george, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  does that sound unreasonable to you?
yes.
i wanna let go. i do...
any reason to think next month will be worse?
she said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  the razor just happened to be there.
wait. what, what are you saying?
where did you hear that name?
colonel will do.
no, i mean - about my client.
sure, sure.
then you use the wrong lipstick--
oh... hi, john.
put those away.  we can't have marks on his wrists.
time for bed, kiddos. say goodnight.
excuse me guys.
i promise.
no, she's right.
you won't die if you let me help.
he was trying to kill me, not you.
hold on a minute.
boy overboard!
most of them.
i didn't say that.
yeah, we'd better keep them for now, i'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
i've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
away from the piano, tita, you have no sense of time at all.
no way to start a partnership.
what're you... what're you pitching me, here?
i didn't sell nothing! i didn't sell nothing! i just carried the drugs from the chief to sam.
tell me what?
well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.
grateful for your candor, sir.
big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
i put the diamond in my coat pocket. and i put my coat... on her.
deep and hard.
no!
i see. well, i'm sorry about that. i wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
you always got something to say.
i don't care about being hip anymore.
she hasn't got any sense. in some ways, she's awful dumb.
what engagement present?
yes, you do. you always back down. you assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
you're tough, j-man.
no, sir?
here! this is it!
has drag city records, i know, i know.  you told dan koretzky about this?
too bad! brings our price down ten thousand francs!
old ties are hard to cut.
george, you're acting very strangely.
it's hard to explain.
because you're having too much fun.
you fucking bastard! lying piece of shit! you're getting married on saturday? what was all that shit you said to me?
i was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. for that, i'm sorry.
no, but i work there--i like it. my dad's a lobsterman.
peter, you couldn't even fix our tv!
yes, very fine. but not all of the pieces look old. some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the goddess kali.
are you jackin' with me?
oh.
well, it's off ration. we know that.
fine with fucking me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
well ya know, delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. yep, it's like our friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. but don't worry, delmar; he'll be back on top again. i don't think we've heard the last of george nelson.
well the answer is that i don't know either.  we haven't done it yet.
he's an actor. one of the great american actors of the 20th century.
i'll tell her but she won't take it.
actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... i think everything's going pretty well...
it's in my family, you know.  my grandmother died in an institution...
y'ever heard of a double agent, bill? i'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist... after the arrest, 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  now here's another one for you:  what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine?
command isn't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
you know how they are... sex...
you have a t.v.?
so it ended. not immediately, of course. i went back to san francisco, and i still saw mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
don quixote.
and cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
we're losing atmosphere...
when a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  the force is all around us.  it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal.  it's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you.
i love that car.
no.
are you kidding? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. i'm like a legend. they call me the cautionary whale.
look.
what are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
why not?
no.
could've fooled me. go away.
now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. rose had a good life. she found her. right, didn't she? she triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
they may. that's why i would keep my mouth shut.
this is the police, ma'am.
i'll try. thanks.
come on, frank. let's go. please.
he likes to play the great man.
son of a bitch.
came to make up, no big deal. your ma home?
get in there and watch 'em. watch their every fuckin' move.
she likes you.  says you're dinky- dau.
i don't know. just one of those. 
uh huh.
sin from my lips? o trespass sweetly urged! give me my sin again.
isn't it true that you --
oh, that 'dukes of hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
i thought you were allergic to latex.
not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
fine. you know. we just went to crossroads.
no, but i think they might.
i don't care if you do or... i want to see mary... before she gets in any deeper...
good luck, mal.
well... send my love, if you see him again.
mr. nevins?
i want him here.  sit down!
god, you have great legs.
you mean, you think i'm cracking?
perhaps not.  you seem to have misplaced a private.  no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
you're not ready.
i just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
out the door and to the left.
gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
what?
i couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
who's the subject?
hello, eve.
anything you want.
oh, no thanks ...
i didn't realize you and hollis were so fond of each other.
according to the njac-the new jersey administrative code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
... you've become quite a close friend of eve's - haven't you mr...  ... chance...?
it's like telling fibs.
once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer.  please, sit, doctor.  i have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  did you know this was once yeltsin's flying dascha?  that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  at least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
yeah? i wouldn't have thought that.
i don't lie, jack. i'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. pretty thin, i work out. my pussy's shaved. my friends say i'm pretty cute, so....
how did nicky collect?
yeah.
i said i like all of them.
you always get what you want?
you can get the general idea...
buddy, i'm a full-blooded chucktow. i can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. the fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another tuesday.
i'm just on my way out...
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of hana on the island of maui...
about an hour ago. i had to hand over all our cash.
ah yes. of course.  to the girl who waits.
where in the hell is he?
we'll worry about that when we get there.
i suppose. i mean they're obviously all bonkers, but i guess they're harmless.
i believe so.
don't you think he's too old, though? how's his health?
you don't know?
just what i said. that's what i --
i know of him.
okay, i guess.
conscience... .  i didn't even know i had one until i met you and edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
you think this is a coincidence? next week half your customers will be buying their scotch, our scotch, from maranzano. in a month, he'll be in scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. i'll be out of business, and you'll be working for maranzano.
why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil? i mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
we all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
 no...
that was beautiful to watch, howard. like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
never fear, tony is here.  ladies first.
hey...wake up.
go on, answer him when he talks to you.  tell him: columbus, marconi... garibaldi.
-- hospital.
i think you closed the bar again. i'll have to go out.
hey.
i sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. you don't mind, do you?
perfect, wonderful, good as i ever felt! except for a big old scar on my stummick, i wouldn't even know i been in the hospital.
the pumps buy you time... but minutes only. from this moment, no matter what we do, titanic will founder.
that's what i deserve for listening in the first place.
that's so sweet, michael. but, really, i've so many things to do.
may i carry your package, grace?
definitely.
your decision. for us.
he's a nice guy. vie ought to keep in touch with him.
baby!  rodeo drive.
sadly, no. hold on! i always keep this on me just in case.
we're both in it, harry.
i know.
jake.
then we've no time to lose!!
yes, edna, and i must say you've been great about the ...
you're crazy.
we're going to get off, all right.  we'll get you off of there.  just...be cool.
i'm pregnant.
can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
john, john.
oh come on. price. there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
...so accomplished.
only a handful of people are aware of its existence. let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
cool....so, if we say eight o'clock.
great! ... if he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. come on -- beat it. it's five o'clock. you need some sleep.
doctor soran?
well!
i got a lot to protect.
later.
yes.
we treat you well enough here, don't we marquis? your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. your antique writing desk, all the way from lacoste. enough quills to feather an ostrich --
you should feed your animals. they're looking peaked.
boy, i hope so, buckaroo banzai.
oh, yeah, "excuse me, sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." he'll kick our asses from here to cleveland.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
betty, i need to talk to you... in person! where're you at?
that depends...
you could say that.
it's crazy, man. instruments are crazy. we're gonna have to eject.
keeping fit then?
one that looks nice.
hardly. who's the girl?
am i home?
mathilda, listen!
whatta you got?
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
you good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you ever die!
they look stupid.
i'll give you a lift, son. too hot to be walking... people die out here, y'know.
what do you want to do?
we've told him we'll deal. what could he possible have to gain by --
my name's sondra.
the hospital...?
not really --
don't move, rudy!
meaning you didn't like it.
the night i take you to places you've never been before.  and back.
graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
i'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay jamie?
the sailor's omen of good fortune. the hunter watching over him on his travels.
there is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin' sorority.
you bet. we'll see you later.
look, i don't know what the hell you're up to, but i think i've got a pretty good idea.
no, i love her, we will be a family. i have her piano. i will mend it, she will get better.
you can tell when people believe you. it's obvious.
you want to do this yourself?  i don't have to do this, you know.
that's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
my present?
it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?
that's right. i was raised very strictly. so don't speak before you are spoken to!
thanks.
listen, it may be a little out of date. you know, i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
laura just took off. she asked me to do the run today. should i do it?
if it helps bring her back, be my guest...
you missed the point, then and now... only his body was "in death," kirk! and you were the last one to be with him.
all this for us?
oh, then you did hear from him?
jordan.  might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  i do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
the situation is, my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford.
i wouldn't talk.
a field trip? maybe i'll join you. see you tomorrow.
is... is it... loaded?
excuse me ?
and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
dead.  trappers killed him.
you didn't marry donna reed.
i have no idea.  her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- i can imagine where she is.  but when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
how do you mean?
that's not correct.
i did at that.
...peanuts.
you don't do that anymore, do you?
but grandpa, you said...
okay, okay.  it's not my job, but what the hell.  i'll do you a favor.  he takes the grocery bags from her.
cause she's dying.
don't get mad.
maggie muldovan? did you...know her?
yes, shaking hands. i don't take a very good picture, though.
what do you mean, he's missing?
okay!!!! anything else?!?
there's no choice.
you could've killed us.
i won't...is missy in heaven, do you think?
you don't know shit!
both sides of the street, i'm afraid.
you look very grown up.  what are you doing?  you meeting your mom for dinner?
jimmy, did you touch her?
i want him back!
right away, ma'am!
alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later.
ok boys. get ready to fire on the count of three.  i'm gonna give you three seconds...
i'm not playing any games! go look at lynette's!
on your desk.
no, i really like my tongue... we're very attached.  oyyyy... okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
you look silly.
what do you mean, dear?
you could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
yes!
we each face death every day we're alive, saavik.
i told you: i'm a sucker for hard luck cases. besides, i want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that gracie is pregnant and calls you admiral.
whoa.  that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
bein' my partner. i'm headin' north up around the niobrara in nebraska. gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
exactly.  now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
...things change.
no! no!
i don't know. i don't understand dickie, marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
well, fortunately, i know how to counter it.  the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
well, somet...
he called you?
okay, martini. that's okay. now you watch me.
you get the job done.
hope for the best? i don't understand all this skepticism. i thought you liked rose.
aren't you coming back with me?
eh, joey, even you don't know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why'd you say them? you coulda said anybody.
i told the d.a. everything i know.
no? how come?
and what if you can't live with it?
we got it. we got it.
you here again? what do you want?
where's the sphere?
i'd love to! or should i pretend i'm busy?
don't you think howard's like that? smart? important?
`til we get a better lead.
i am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, mr. nugent.
you've already made a start. doesn't look that clean, though.
i don't think i'd notice. i'm so used to carl.
very.
can i come? i'll start a fire...
what?
you're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
it's an important speech.
oh, my <u>program</u>...
and a car.
who's gonna win?
the fools! if they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
this is where the stories are. you are going to become friends with these people. you are going to party with them. you are going to hang out with them on weekends. when they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
barton. empathy requires... understanding.
yes.  i'm not out of shape.
how long would they let me sleep?
you'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots.
what do you mean you know?  he told you he was gonna propose to me?
poppy, please --
come where?
seriously. what's it like to be eighteen?
you don't know how to hotwire.
according to the guinness book, you passed the world's record several whacks ago.
probably safe in the hands of the federal government.
i didn't ask you to come away with me--
everyone in the theater is screaming. maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. she eats her popcorn.
i'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
blood...
rob. please focus.
i'd be happy too, if i had such a great family.
[everything on the cellphone. we wait for calls. we have no number to call.]
my name is penny. penny priddy.  there i've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  i'm a nobody.
have you ever seen elaine's portrait?
i'm talking about you. and what you want.
in these woods you are a commoner. now be quiet.  true royalty approaches.
i got sicker.
thaaaat's right, dude.  the weight. the ringer can't look empty.
are you going to do this or what?
you want me to tell you it's your fault?  it probably is.  what are you going to do about it?   i thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
even so. you still got time. relax a minute, tell me what happened. sit down.
okay.  one minute.
so i see.
i want to ask you a few questions.
i couldn't say.
diner, huh? let me tell you what the problem is. i wake up drugged to find what? you've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. he's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue h&k 9mm. i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. how's that for twisted logic? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i "walked" in? and if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money? then i notice how beefy they both are. hell, even the waitress is cut. all three of them look like they went through the same training program. ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. that's how i knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if i gave him all day. why?
what're you, nuts? we had pancakes for breakfast. i gotta go somewhere i can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  not more fuckin' pancakes. come on.
where did it all come from?  or is that a permissible question?
i had such an awful dream.
two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
wait a second sid. don't you go jumping the gun. you haven't seen the best part.  with the aides of the computer revolution of y2ki've been able to steal your voice.  ain't it cool? listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
what arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
did you say 'kill' my sister?
<u>where am i</u>?
what?
you gotta earn trust.
i don't need this--i know all about my condition.
you know there's only one man in the world for me, johnny-o.
rashid. rashid cole. 
another attack?
what do you mean?
you know who the <u>father</u> is...?
it's a waste of time.
but you didn't even taste your cocoa.
sorry. i swear i'm not a gear snob.
yes. you may.  you there. what does munro call you?  the "scotsman" has sent one of his indian allies to guide you.
thanks. roll 'em, donut.
oh, adam, the model looks so good. the historical society will love it.  you've finished the streets?
unwelcome?  i guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
so you have information for me?
michael, take deep breaths.
you have to do it.
tonight.  well, you've started a tempest in a teapot.
pleased to meet you.
ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- y-yes, your honor.  you see, a while back, we were walking down the yellow brick road, and --
my hat?
what are you going to do?
do you want to have some breakfast?
a bill! not *him*!
i don't know... i'm sorry, but dana's a very jealous person. i just don't want to screw that up right now... i'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
what are you complaining about? it worked out. everything's cool. now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. we deserve a little reward.
not anymore. you've seen one of them. you won't be allowed to live after that.
only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... fact is, you are gonna pay me, and i am gonna provide you with a service.
fine.  why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
try?
yeh, i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf.
that was seven hundred years ago.
it's freezing up here, beefy.
never.
sure.
are you crazy?
well i was just throwing out ideas...
i had an appointment at his office, i think i must have got it wrong. we had a meeting...
you must not remember anything. come on.
i know. word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
i guess, the truth is i'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  even when they try to act like heroes.
you've asked me that one three times.
why, yes, margot, i do. once again, we joined hope in the search for her identity. as you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil stefano --
there's a small village in hampshire, near stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. that's where i was born.  my father taught me about the training, about finding the slayers, reading the signs.  there's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  i thought so myself for a time, when i was younger...  i'm sorry.  i'm not supposed to... i shouldn't go on like this.
use your head, you dumb bitch!  he's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip!
my baby.
yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
joe --?
we've repeated.  a few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
then why are you teaching me...?
eh?
thanks. i like it when you say that, sam.
is he not back yet?
no, you don't understand. i've been inside malkovich when i'm with maxine...
what!?  ted okum doesn't know shit. they've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. what ted okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl.
which one?
that's right. so, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
yeah... not bad for a city college boy. bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...i just got on the board of the zoological society, cost me a million; that's the thing with wasps -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
how you doing, bob?
it's always john.
dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  he was at the scene.  he grabbed the cash.  of course.  this is perfect!
think i'll lay down with him. only way i'll get outta here.
i beg your pardon?
i can see that but where ?
you're an attractive man.
in an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. that way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
i'll page you.
no. just pool.
c'mon, lee.  he's going to jail.  you won, now just put the gun down.
like i know his intention? or yours for that matter?  i should join sam. i'm too old for this bullshit.
my plant manager is somewhere on this train. if it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why.
how the hell did tan get away with it?
you just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
call me at work.  we can arrange to meet properly.  i don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  i know what you're like.
what is it?
like you couldn't believe.
it's not like she's a real redhead, jake...
rico! rico! rico! is that enough?  and keep your meat hooks off my radio.
did it break?
that's two hundred dollars a day? so he can get a hooker and some tequila.  veto, darwin.
he.  can't.  answer.
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy.
i was in it.
you blaming me for the traffic?
horror show. what'd you do tonight?
tough day.
they're just eggs, elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
oh . . .
have to be. the shit she's gone through.
whoa there, tex!  we've been through all this.
trent, i don't feel like going out tonight. i got shit to do tomorrow...
love a cup of tea. with lemon.
we've been fully briefed, mrs. brigman.
that's not your line.
i like 'em. if you don't you can f --
i guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? i never even kissed mama on the mouth.
what?
i left my pomade in that car! maybe i can creep up!
yeah. yeah. i bet ya feed maranzano that same line.
tell me what you want me to say. anything.
well why don't you clean up this dump!
you make it up, but it has to be believable.  they call it suspension of disbelief.
yes. with some re-inforcements i'm confident we could impose order.
yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. okay?
to hell with you!
don't ever say that.
if he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
no.
trust me.
d'you get his name?  course not.  jesus, ed --
of course.  it's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
alan-one. he calls me... may i pass?
jason? what about me? what do i do?
how did they threaten you?
i've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
till it's in a powder.  the energy exits within you...
afraid of?  certainly not you captain solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
kay, i'm sorry...
a little comanche squaw - squaw!
he wasn't able to get out of bed today.
no you don't.  you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  am i right?
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg.
norm?
wow.    i'm bad news.
that's all??  that seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
okay, okay... i've got some tequila. you want some tequila?
politics man, fuckin' politics. that o'neill man got his nose so far up top's ass he gotta be pinocchio...
simply preposterous. do you know what i did last night? last night, mr. chang, i held a sort of a self- inventory. i said to myself last night, mr. chang, i said, "lovey"—  mr. lovett! "mr. lovett," i said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
because i don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
we'll go around that way, come up on foot.
we've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
not exactly.
i know.
now, we can't go against the law, dorothy. i'm afraid poor toto will have to go.
playing with something really hot. yeah.
strategic air command.
oh yeah?  wanna arm wrestle...?
she didn't notice.
all right, i'll try...
it should work -- theoretically. if it doesn't, the mission's off. the craft's nuclear-powered. except for your wireless.
you have to warn her - this second! i'm catching the next flight back!
duff, i love you.
and i'm grateful for you, frank, especially with those boors around. we've grown very close in a short time.
-- i'm on it --
okay.
you're totally insane.
do you smoke?
just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
you surprise me.  eliminating a rival like that.  such are the actions of a man of conquest.  i was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
shit, if i'd known you were working, i would've come even later.
what happened, did you hit him?
mrs. lefferts, i just want to ask a few questions.
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
oh, please!
i'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  hi, randal.
uh huh?
three twenty-five.
a little weak today.
open the door.  it's me.
hush your mouth.
no. roy. roy v.
i wanted to see her.  it's nobody's business.
-- a brillo pad, i don't care, anything.
that don't surprise me. if you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that frank burns is a jerk.
good.  that's real good.
how nice. how do you do, senator?
i might be able to find something on the ship. but it's gonna take time.
not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! we just don't add up to dry shit.
you don't love me, is that it?
of course you do, tommy tune.
so what happened?
oh.
one point two million dollars? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
age?
we never had a problem with that before.
dies y nueve.
where?
ha. he was building his fucking porch.
you didn't have to get off the other line. i would've called you back.
of course not.
some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
he was executed. he was on death row and then he was executed.
i can't believe this.
what?
wait a minute -  i've got it. there! off the port bow!
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, i mean, that was like - i mean, i have some dignity.
your call.  have a good night.
nguyen is good boy.
gimme a minute.
oh, did you hear that!  what a give-away.
oh, thank you, thank you so much!
isn't that rather too close...?
electronic surveillance.
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
...yah -- well, at least, y'know, i got to perform. and mom got to see me.  i guess number eight only worked for diane sawyer...
was that supposed to make me feel better? 
they have every right chuck.
hi mom.
no trouble.
of course.
two packs of cigarettes say dunbar never gets out of the compound.
c'mon, i knew it was you.
shut up.  we've lost enough lives already.
whatta' you whinin' about? he said i'm next.
hold it, hold it. here.
that was before he pulled this 'dick me or i dump you' shit. i say fuck his best friend.
barbatus?
you've earned it -- the horse ranch on the toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
the lenape.  he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
up to?
ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to hot town. green lights and white lines all the way.
'but i say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
no.  not yet...
...don't you like me?
so it was "love".
just for revenge. that's what keeps me going. it's all i have.
which few did you have in mind, majesty?
you need time to think. about the case, about you and me.
of course they are.  christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
been to the boat show.
bye-bye!
seven-ish
oh.
segovia begged me for me secret but i said, "no, andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
oh my god. is her son ok?
i never thought about it.
thanks for loading me on the stage. i know now why you did it.
just being obstinate, sir. i'll handle it.
two fifty-three, five--
i'm a dentist
and in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
as i was saying, before i was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. he needed someone to take care of him.  we move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  nice enough place but kind of depressing. but not for granddad.  he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  it just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
he's here somewhere.  find him.  the sub's on it's way.  go!  c'mon!
you're forty-two years old, johnny, and mama is still running your life.
yeah.
well, what was left of him.
what does this have to do with--?
you're not?
and that appears to have been destroyed. it also contained the anti-virus, bellerophon.
i think it's a bad idea.
you little shit.  when did they get to you?
no.
i am the one who is rotting. but i think your face looks graver than mine.
the supreme being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! it's a miracle!!!
i'll say.
no.  i mean yes.
now he's back.
no!
a few friends... just a little dinner party.
look dad, i'm not a salesman. how many times i gotta tell you i'm an account executive, and pretty soon i'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
a hundred and fifty-six. some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. so three a week's not too bad.
why does everyone find that so surprising?
vicki. we got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. he goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  crazy bat-stard!
what happened? you described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on tv?
doubt is a motherfucker.
did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  tell me, because i really want to understand.  did he jerk off to it?  you watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  i'm sorry.
it's ok, eugene. i understand... i'll go fix breakfast. 
you wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
that's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
...girl, y'know i had to bring big mamma through.
if i...you know...
what?
somewhere around "d+2xy something something."
i could go with you.
trick him.
of course. i'm a traditional guy... it's a traditional event.  well, what do you think?
if your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank.  and that makes you my new best friend. i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
she's praying.
sid found me the icepack.
i'm a credit card junkie. i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. now i'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
i know that, mr. gardiner.
really?  what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
this pizda? never seen him before.
what happened to you, nick?  i mean, look at yourself...
show me.
what's happening?
you were there?
you act like you never had peanut butter before --
i'd rather not.
don't shoot!
i hope not . . . i've got to call on her this morning!
<i>her car was in the shop.</i>
yes, it does. the sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
i don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. mr vitovetch is a good friend of the judge.
before you go...
a word of advice: sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
it just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, kenny.
three, four.  he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember...
what have i done?
uh-huh.
i have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge.
all the girls drink - but i'm the one that gets caught.  that's the story of my life. i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
no. poetic justice, though.
you're sick too...he loved to do things to me. control me. my mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. she become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- i liked it. i liked being controlled by jake. the truth was as far out and crazy as he got, i wanted <u>more</u>. i wanted to go all the way. women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. the first time he finished with me, he said i was a woman now. i was 14. then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. it's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... they found my mom right down there  at the bottom of apache leap. she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil...sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane. but i'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. she was born on this earth and she loved it. she was like me. she just wanted to fly away.
you're pissing me off again, ed.
like me.
now you are confusing me, mrs de moraes.
i don't know, i never met your father.
yes, sir.
i'd say it is. not a doubt in my mind.
everyone's invited, of course.
i'm clay phillips.  my brother steve.
well, the salesman could be available soon.
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  you were with her, weren't you?
i don't think so.  you should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
no, no, that one.
yeah?
i heard screaming. the door was locked. are you okay...
tipsy, topsy, turvy.
verona again.
do you know what you're saying?
this cousin of yours... what's his name?
because i should have shown her before... everyday, i should have shown her.
let me do it for you, mr. white.
okay... maybe that would be best.
i resent your tone, sir. i have men who are missing -
she -- was -- an -- invalid!
very good, sir.
why are you so interested? why do you keep asking me?
barnes took a bullet right there. at ia drang valley...  and the cocksucker survived - that's baaad man. that's his high, baby. high on war!
tehronne? tehronne done this?
if that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
you're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
don't gimme that.
what's to sketch?
we love it. i only wanted to prepare you.
i've got it.
you know who the raincoats are?
come on! we're wasting time!
i'm sheriff deeds--
what's this?
i said that's enough!
i've struck the mother-lode.  i'm counting... spade work....
i understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while i radio back to hq -
you are not gonna believe this, evelyn!  absolutely fantastic!  i'm on my way --
i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
unbelievable.
sure is.  so why call me?
i'm a little dizzy...
if this war ended tomorrow, zion is where the party would be.
i didn't kill the watchman.
grand central. you better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
i'm trying!
they say you're in debt.
but that's impossible!! george asked her out! he had to! i saw him walk her home! oh, god!
don't be.  wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
what's a dying giraffe sound like?
stay here! don't stop working!
she's scared! fear is an emotion!  look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with harry zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
look, i'd love to keep chatting-
oh. so...
blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
i've called liz. they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim. i thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
we must sue for peace.
it was the biggest i could find.
it's great when people who work together can become real friends.
what would you be doing now?
we've talked enough, benjamin.
how do you know?
didn't you here all them sirens? it's been all over the radio.  some guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the trattoria roma.
thank you.
well, i just thought i'd call.
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month. the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
yeah.
they can't be serious. the ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
you guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a heaven - and god, i hope so - i know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause his pains he done left down here. baaaaaaaaa! 
i don't know.
i insist that you have it.
finish, please!
what do you want from me? i was reassigned. i'm out.
and surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
touch some deer feces out in the forest. eat a sandwich without washing your hands. then you got lyme disease.
no, dignan. it's not your gun. it's all of ours.
what is it?  how does it work?
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago.
what?
sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
well, are...are they big?
oh, what? you're going to take the professor's side on this?
over there -- that's ricky tan.
we can't do without you.  you're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  you're practically an institution around here.
i think it looks good.
thank you very much, hal.
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
the most respected...
see y'at the finish line.
then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the greater world...how pleased am i to see you looking so well...
well, let's see now... if it has my name on it, then i guess it's mine.
loud and clear.
what's old got to do with it?
fine.  do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  the gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  and when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  it'll be all- out war and you know it.
and last, but not least, adolph... you know who.
maybe.  i don't know.
tell me--i'm dyin' to hear it.
just sit back and enjoy the show.
i've got a theory.
i should have hired this man.  get somebody up there!
yes - i have had it for years.
yes.
take me away...
designed for piscatorial research -- the spawning habits of deep sea fish.
yeah, i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
what was your name again?
good.  i'd miss you.  you can get into trouble, though. you're not really a cop anymore.
right ben. let's go fuck. i'll fuck anything that moves.
this plane can not land!
takes diamonds to stay on this list.
jack.
but...
actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. it's all quantum physics and molecular attraction.  there are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
i had to get away!  my life was in danger!
how would you like to join the denominators? the math team could really use a new brain. we lost our best logarithm guy last year.
a key party?
good. now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
with a ramses graph on the binary tree--
no. you know how people talk. so i decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
captain, what have i done -
i think you've got your t41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. it's either that or a new washer.
so that gives you something.
you would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
what if he doesn't bite?  what if he's an exceptionally bright raccoon?
later.
i knew you would, pal.  a bird in a gilded cage, eh?
betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
really? what else does your mother say?
you stay in the car. i'll come and listen.  what you want to tell me, thorpey?
thanks for showing me the bookstore. perhaps you could, uh, take me to an aa meeting sometime.  uh...uh, i'd love to see what goes on.
they said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  you think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  from where i sit the world could stand a little improving.
mom, i hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  if you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
he's scottish, col.
you harlin?
what is it honey... the frenchy?
we found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
i find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  but if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  there's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  you should prepare yourself.
yeah.
alonzo, you don't need to go home.
i won't let you die.
i know. it was the same when i was carrying will. like clockwork.
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
i can thank you for that. it was a hard-earned talent.
oh, roz.  my mind is so far beyond yours now.  i could beat you at chess now.
stop the damn car.
... i will.
i'm a little worried --
give me one more day, sir. the damage control is easy. reading klingon is hard.
oh, i don't know... i think that once i dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... i could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  like fer shurr!
thank you.  we met last week, at the wajda film.  you won't remember. we didn't actually speak.
i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something.
yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  you and me, pablo?  are we good?
james...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  you tried to call and...
there won't be ... there won't be ... what else do you need?  how else can we help you?
all right, i have detonation time at... wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  all right, i have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  okay, i have six minutes exactly. does that check out down there?
you see, he'd been very clever. everybody, even our astute friend guild, thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. but our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  the telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant. so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case.  mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen wynant?
where're you going to go?
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
wouldn't we all.
what is this?
we should go to the metro it's quicker.
i don't understand that, sheriff young.
right.  that's exactly what i meant.
it's mom.
well, this weekend john was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and i started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
moneypenny! how indiscreet! have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
mhm.
nobody said... norman...  what?  why are you looking at me like that?
certainly.
it's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  anywhere else i'd be an interesting little number, here i'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one.  sag meaning screen actor's guild.
it is not a question of liking, your majesty. your own law decrees it, i'm afraid.
kinda like david and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- i'll do it.  i'll take it on.
see venice and die, isn't that right? or is it rome? you do something and die, don't you? okay, venice is on the list.
no!  that is not an audience!  that is plaster!  an audience is people made of flesh!  they -- live and breathe!  got it?!
i could tell you were sad.  i just wanted to see if you were all right.
that's not what's worryin' me. why didn't she tell us? maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
she wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face margo...
it is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. i hope you will forgive me. i know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. don't you recognize me? i am the duchess swana.
but in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  there will be no way to stop it.
don't worry about it. who sent the flowers?
why, the chairman presides at the meetings.
then you never loved me?
that fucking bitch!
what about?
she came in here, wait, she...i was giving her a massage...wait...wait!  she came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, i told her i could not--we don't know each other, you see...
maybe next time.
you like the women, don't you, wilhelm?
yeah. on the section gang.
you don't have to do a thing. chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class!
do you really think billy did it?
what did i 'get?'
sure, earl, everybody knows about them.  we just didn't tell <u>you</u>. come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  we're really <u>in</u> on something here!
i'd like to be a farmer. i want to help things grow, to encourage life. do you and your friends need a farmer?
cleans dirt. let's go.
[ok, repeat the drop instructions.]
you better not have too much joy.
you can't!
gotta go, mom.
what's that?
don't worry, you...
you're never out, fergus.
well, i don't know what you gonna do about it, because i don't hear no riot an' i don't see no riot, an' what's more i don't believe they *is* no riot.  look for yourself.
sure --
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  you're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
you're actually having sex with your own little girl? is that possible?
whose toe was it, walter?
that's what serafine is searching for. without much luck, i'm afraid. if only we could speak with him. but alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
how come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  how come nobody ever says they were joe schmo?
that's a lotta crap.
where are you-hoo?
i have to.
what happened? oh my god...
the del ammo mall mostly.
what time in the morning was this?
my father had this friend... he was an inventor...
sam?  andy gave sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
that's not right, really, cuz i...
no-o!
give her time.  beauty is skin deep.
well, where do they hold court?
i still don't know what you're talking about.
of what?
thanks... that's ...
hey, asshole! that's not cool!
that means you won't have a gun.
i'm sorry... i guessed wrong.  i though you were a han.
i can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. you tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  come on, tell me...
i don't trust harry to do it.
jesus christ, whose side are you on?  i haven't even gotten the part yet.  can't i enjoy the idea even for a little while?
they came all the way from tarzana.
just one bottle. i believe in moderation.
you do business in cuba with your husband?
then how are you involved?
you mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
well you should all go to bed early. i'll do the cleaning up.
really.  by what right?  six months of part-time screw-ups?
thank god.
you gotta kill yourself.
what else should i become?  there's no difference between virginia and england.  i must be educated if i'm to take my place in society.  my father couldn't afford to send me to england for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  everyone laughs at me.
you're welcome.  dad?…would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
all that detail, just from memory...?
mary had a little lamb.
you don't have to be unfriendly.
i used to like yogurt.
no.
who's they?
please, really. i'm not hungry.
eighteen thousand feet, sir. and two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
not much, admiral. we have partial main power...
yup. claire... please, please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
you didn't, professor. it was an accident! you see, what happened --
you ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
frisk me, baby. give me a real pat down.
i had the cause of death.
did someone say i wasn't nice?
oh, my god!  she's right! why did i turn off allison portchnik? she was-she was beautiful. she was willing. she was real... intelligent.  is it the old groucho marx joke? that-that i-i just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
what will you have me do? marry you instead?
what're you going to do?
you're sure mr. brandon won't mind?
all right, doc...
this from a girl who still plays with dolls.
i'm sorry!  i said something wrong, didn't i!  please forgive me!
they weren't worth a damn.
yeah. yours?
we don't know.
and i got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. why, not all the boy rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put humpty-dumpty together again--
why is that?
objection!
perhaps...
i'll go with you.
sorry.
why not let your publisher judge that?
the funny thing is, i'm not randall either. i'm logue.
he has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
much anger in him, like in his father.
guess i'm not a single type guy.
i'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
your address?
i know, well, it's just that- you know, i mean, i-i-i-i gotta sing tomorrow night, so i have to rest my voice.
a sponsor.
home.
here.
what kind?
i want to see that.  do you mind if i stay... on the side?  i won't bother you.
he's always in a bad mood.  count ya blessin's. ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
i don't know, bob.  i'm flattered and all, but i've got a kid, now.
thank you.
i'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
her dog, yes.
i've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
we have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. we'll be back shortly.
-- stop --
i --
it's pretty.
do we care?
dolores, don't you understand?  i'm a director now!  i made "glen or glenda."  directing <u>is</u> my day job.
very nice.
no girl? only biz, my dear artiste?
he's dead?
you want him to stay in this country.
i've been working night and day.  i haven't had time.
you hear that, bitch?  be quiet!
is everything okay?
this is crazy.  i can't trust you. you can't trust me.  how can we possibly help each other?
she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
yes...!
you have a weakness for lady cops.
nachurly. jus' like i'd tell you.
who's the "we"?  there's you and there's us.  and all we got from you was bad intel.  "low-level producer."  yeah, right...
are you juno, our case worker?
mon general, i have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  i am serving without salary.
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world. canada is completely overwhelmed.
i know all the kids coming up. got to stay ahead of the game. but i don't know you.
in costa rica?
what shall we call him?
yeah, we're just screwing around. like mohammed said. can't take a joke, man? hey, i hope you got a permit for that, mama!
oh, i'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  i'm real low on money.
you walked out on this academy six years ago. one week to graduation. you think we forgot that? you think i did?
it's awful soon after ben's passing.
it will be okay.
are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody.
too happy. that's why i discharged her.
indeed it is. during the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. as it were.
i feel fine!
that's right, harry.
what?
i have nothing more to say.
ultra ninja megazord complete!
okay.  what's the second thing?
ask travis. he's the ladies man.
it's a short film.
what, why?
can we do it at my office?
jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about mr. lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? well--that was *you*. someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. this country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! and when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
what's that?
i don't know.
coming, eileen...
i don't get involved with guns.
how do you mean?
back up!  back...
thank you.
yeah, well i have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>that</u> direction.
damn.
the playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! and this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt, over and over, full of those bill sampson touches!
then how come she knows what's going on?
what he said. we didn't know jack shit about and riot. it just happened. it was kismet. we didn't even know those people. how are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  i mean, it's not like we care. if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. it won't exactly keep us up at night. but you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
what do you mean?
frankly, i'm shocked.  marvin acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
i don't know. there's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
some, military... special program, oklahoma somewhere...
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident. we try to remember we're a military organization.
... thank you.
and a good thing too.
know what we need, man?... some rope.
there is no candy!
no, you said i should get my degree.  i like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold.
now, i don't know amy --
when he uses a phrase like "i am happy", i think we should think twice about what we ask him.
because i can stop now if you want.
i never make plans that far ahead.
natalie who?
uh huh .. he's well rehearsed ..
better than we thought.
tell us.
kay-em 14.
roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  we're on a tight timeline.
after you, doll.
oh i don't think so.
"dracula."
...don't feel like it either.
he doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
there was a recipe on the back  --
let's go. eject.
sure i am.  she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. if you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president's wishes.  i can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
i thought you might want some hot coffee.
...and one of those guys was you! the last one, i might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that i've been faithful to you since we met! all the other guys i went with before i met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  but don't look at me like i'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
your dreams?
i do mean it.  and i mean this... if faith stays you go away and never come back. you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  you understand?
i'm fine dad.
a year at harvard and you'll  see this "federal service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
what?  what movie?
so did i.
that's awful. the poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
yep.
that's right. and you fuckin' lost! and some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
the heroin. you don't have it.
now see here, my good man. i've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
-- i'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the united states government -- me -- i'm the one being ripped off!
all right -- roby and melkonis will go with faust.  hunter and i will make up the second team.
he already thinks you're out of your mind, louise, that don't carry much weight with darryl.  are you at work?
patience. diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. we can wait.
can't help it. you're doing time for me. no greater love, as the man says. wish you'd tell me why.
about how pretty you are, pretty boy.  maybe he'd like to know --
do me a favor, will you?
that's smart.
that's unique.
but i don't want to be miniaturized -- !
very good.  how did you know?
i think the facts speak for themselves. the same noble picard blood runs in our veins. had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as i am. look in the mirror, and see yourself.
the 'job?' alls i know is i'm taking you to the soho grand.
only if new jersey counts.
so sensitive.
they look like good kids.
yeah, a great weekend. forget the weather!
he must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. when the plane landed he was dead.
no, no.  i saw eight geese flying in a "v".
whoa, check it out.
yeah.  i'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
we're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - nellie weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  come on, jerry.
the police always do, don't they?
no, i'm not worried.
naturally.  it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  but this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
you? no, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
yup, you must be harry? sorry, i didn't know your father.
heavens no. we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
this has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
i don't have it. i don't know where it is.
more history, rose.
we'll pray -- and she'll be there.
oh my god. madam elsa, my psychic, told me i would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
and your jewelry too.  i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
no rats. thanks a lot that's terrific.
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain.  ferrie handled a lot of the training.  there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba.  a few americans got trained, too.  nazi types. mercenaries.  but ferrie was the craziest.
photos?
sure.
&lt;&lt;i'll tell you everything. i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. just tell this man i want protection. real protection.&gt;&gt;
no. god no.
you're not going anywhere...  sam...
here, you gotta delivery.
i'm going to the store.
well, this *is* an orphanage.
oh, buddy, i've never had someone be so protective of me!
very well.
i hated myself.  i kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a zombie.
then do it the way you want.
what?
i'm afraid if i stop talking i'll lose you.  just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
what are, what are you doing? look, tim, just go home. alright. go home and sleep it off.
where is it?
i can remember everything.  that's my curse, young man.  it's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  memory -  i was his oldest friend.  as far as i was concerned, he behaved like swine.  maybe i wasnt' his friend.  if i wasn't, he never had one.  maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge -
that's great if you're a computer. in the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. the building's 600 feet high.
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
so where are they? starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
please, it's common knowledge. her mother was a trollop.
mr. thomerson.
it was exciting.
well, i'm a puppeteer...
well...i guess they did get a little carried away.
i don't know why i said that. she's not dead at all.
well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
mmmhmm.
you are ill.
and you have to smile.
is it different where you've been?  don't they have places like this?
that is a contradiction. the borg act as a collective consciousness. there are no individuals.
they went right to the president.
i'd buy it!
your husband?!
i'll die either way.
don't call me "mack," honey.
should we?
what for... why?
oh. then who's this one?
the writings of saint thomas aqu... aquin...
you "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  six years, not one damn murder...
yes...
easy, billy, just open it.
he's right. two people must have pocketed their ballots. usually it's more.
don bobadilla is already a judge, my dear don cristobal.
santos... i can't...
close only by virtue of antithesis.
he's intelligent, but not experienced. his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
probably best. you may want to shoot yourself half way to ohio.
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
thank you, will. i'll do that.
no, no -- just had a little accident.
it may not be your decision to make.
busy night for a tuesday. we had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. full moon or something. what can i get you?
not true.  besides, jack's the romantic.
no.
lloyd, give it up.
not now, elaine.
i can't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush.
we are not a saloon act.  we do not take tips from dirty old men.
but you did have a salvation army- thing going.
i'm sorry. what will you do?
is that right?
oh, sure okay.
hmmm... she's beneath me, i'm afraid.
all over.  chicago, miami, detroit. just lately albuquerque.
what?  how?
it's all right, sheriff.
a rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. i think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
but that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to leslie.  i've told you that a million times...
we'll see.  let's try clark.
i can only tell you what he told us...
you have forgotten my last name?
i will not have them on my conscience. they will stay in my room.
daddy?
no.
brandon.. just in case i die, there's something i have to know...
young? she's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as lovejoy's kid. bernie. one she calls bernard. have you read the script?
if i said yes, then you might think me a norman bates, or a ted bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
good evening, dr. lechter.  thank you for coming.  i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
yes.
how?
he's alright.  he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july.
this is not about my reputation! this is not about me at all!  the event horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. we lost the dream.  i have to go.
kitty...
did you buy that gun?
fine. are you?
well, you know lindsey, too damn aggressive-- son of a--!!
are you sure?
yllo's dead. we...we thought you were too.
i'm sorry.
okay, thank you.
is that good?
...he had a bald skull and...
nice to meet you.
grandpa. my father. it's his.
hey, what's that?
it was all junk!
keep your voice down.
what?
why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named ashley?
you're brill.
was what worth it?
my ankle. just go explain the situation.
yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would i be?
are you married?
will and deanna joining the titan. dr. crusher going to starfleet medical...
yes.
truly.
yeah...
max.
he did?  i don't remember.  did he say about me?  in the trunk?
whose house is it?
yorgi asked me to.
what time you get off work here?
i told you i don't like to talk about it.
yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
the valley?
yeah, man. where is your beer?
yes -- to paris? i wanted to go there always.
mmm.
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
...do you really want me to forget about you?
tourists, about twenty of 'em.
what are you?
and what are the mau-mau's going to do for us today?
uh-huh. so how do you know it was a he?
shut up.
they're my friends.
the infamous wayne charm. does it ever shut off?
makes cecil b. demille look like the senior class play, right?
..in the building...
she said it was coming....
i'm through with puppets, lotte. i just want you to know that.
n...nothing.
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here ain't no help.
the trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
well, thanks.  you wouldn't believe what i went through to get those. right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
i'll tell you at the end of the week.
yeah, but what about--
i'd be careful if i were you. god knows what he's up to.
it's miss america, n'you're bert parks. 
we think we know where betty is.
what do you mean?
i confirmed it on the scanner. i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people.
after all this mess then.
well, i've been on a diet since i was nineteen, which means basically i've been hungry for a decade.  i've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
some of my best friends are scientists.  they're saying the machine is alive.
yeah...i remember.  i used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
negative. cancel it.
you'd never understand.
caught one?  you mean you got shot?
comas are unpredictable. he could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
certainly a nomination.
if i didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, i certainly won't give them to you now.
there is something to be said for silence
it's a growth business.
out!
no, it's not. i thought i was done waiting for reed... we're all in this together now, ben.
sir?
and how long did i tell you you could stay?
seven eighty-five out of twenty.  take care of yourself now, and don't do anything i wouldn't do.
what was the matter with it?
to the shark.
sorry.
are you stupid or what?
why do you ask?
this place is a perk, kate.
come quickly, colwyn. i can see the eyes of the beast.
when you were his student? did he come on to you?
look, ma, come on out. really. i need to talk to you.
well, here's what i think happened. a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. why? perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. the psychedelic drug market is big these days. he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
the embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  gestating.  then it...  ...then it...emerges.  moults. grows rapidly --
yes, i think that one may be.
salzburg.  we were just talking about salzburg.  if you've come from my friend the fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. because i've got good news for him. i'm done with vienna. it's over, finished, done with! done with! done with!
but why?
no, you may wait behind the screen.
man, what do you want?
home sweet home!
oh, yes, sir, all day long. he never leaves the house until evening. he just sits there, writing and writing. he doesn't even eat.
norad's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle endeavor's in sleep mode.
good morning mrs. macneil.
slow down a second, you met with low --
i'd use the word insane.
greg never came home.  a few hours is one thing, nick, but this is different. something's happened to him.
the one with 'philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
you're too late.
it was like sex was a game to her. she got off on the control.  she always used to tell me it had to be her way.
i dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
so what's up with you and dela?
really.
and... where are things?
that's it, i'm goin'...
you'll be gone, period.
that's right.
when served warm --
listen, it's important. we need to talk about what we're going to do --
do you like red?
well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  do it!  come on, you want to do it.  you're gonna die, johnny.  five more seconds.  four...
alright. come on, you guys.
i...i can't do that.
i don't want to see her hurt.
that's my job.
in my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. plain german. for plain people.
i'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with josh.  and george would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
i really think you should talk to him about this.
...i do.
thanks.
yes.  are you shaking?
i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
more than that.
it's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
any better and i'd be guilty.
which one did you take, will?
is linda here?
how about this child? you expect *her* to be responsible?
aye.
emma!
first, about the girl's history. evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
be nice to rose. she's never had a real home.
you mean spies and things like that?
how much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
all right, where is he?
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...tell me a little about her.  she got great tits?
and he still wants to marry me!
thanks, joe.
it's...doesn't matter....
well i'm going to major in business administration and, i think, minor in communications.
you understand which side the gelatin's on?
how much?
hang on. this is important, bob. anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation. the money and the people. you're responsible for the external situation. the streets and the getaway.
growing a beard...
prepare for a change in lifestyle.
what?
we did.
then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
cole, this was a legal courthouse. laws were passed here. some of the first laws of this country. this building was full of lawyers. lawmakers.
what about it?
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt.
ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i don't get if i qu -- it's too complicated. i -- besides...
bruckner's seventh. the adagio.
don't go.
i said, come here!
because it's your job, that's all.
i'd like you to leave now.
i was saying... it might even be possible that anna had left with them.
i'll get home all right now.
jean-i'm not-
what about me?
what?
i don't think it's negative five.
santa claus.
d-day.
open it and count it.
what's he care about?
what?!
yeah, but for what?
i don't answer questions, i ask 'em...
okay.
wedding.  wedding.  you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
just missed deleon.  hayes is up in the squad.
promise! you gotta promise!
the challenger exploded. principal kelly's about to make an announcement.
i'll be a minute.
it's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
well, we can talk about it.
what?
now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. it's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. it's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
jesus, man. plus ten?
say what?
yeah.
well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
can i really believe you this time, adam?
c'mon.
relax.  i've flown with my old man a million times.  and he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
no.  why?
it's the free diving world championship.  i am by the way world champion!
alright, i made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
goodbye.
and i don't like paranoid accusations! i'm a journalist. think. use your head. how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
i've seen enough. turn it off.
make it out to cash!
because my mom gets the bill.
yeah. the things you were talking about.
yes sheriff.
jeez, what's the difference? just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
you say that like i don't know that.
who!
must have been the redman.  a lenape indian lives in the western woods.
i can't, honey.  i promised allison i'd go shopping with her. sorry.
don't hit me! please, for god's sake, don't hit me.
ain't there yet.
meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. for instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
yeah.
know him?
everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
not enough, i guess.
yeah?
half past eleven.
you're not going anywhere. you're 15 years old!!
who was just here?
vivian, what the --
certainly not.
you bet.  hang on....
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
you have what i asked for?
you got it all in your head?
no.
outstanding.
six martinis.  you're not going to have anything on me.
pretty boring, i guess.
do you know how much i missed you?
we have a memo here, from your friend mr. krendler at the justice department.
is that like a party trick?
it didn't work dewey.  we tried,  we're different.
he looks familiar.  did he do a calvin klein ad?
sure...he lives there?
germany.
-- please, get away from me.
i'd like to have a talk with him.
why not?
i know. when the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
well, i just placed a call to your mother.  she had stepped out but i have some news for her.
on that old shortwave?  maybe on a clear night.  come on now, under the covers.
well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
do you see?
well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. do you see the implications? this would be, in a grander situation, as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor.
you guys know her?!  i gotta have an intro!  man, i'd like to --
one of the accountants.
come on malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  and it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
i didn't have a choice.
she sacrificed herself..
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
rat gizzards. they smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
i think you're fucking crazy!
but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy.
i don't know, but i've got to get on there.
do you still want to do something tonight?
the reason i can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that i have a lighter density under earth's gravitational force.
where. up joey's ocarina. didn't you know?
alright, alright, enough with the boy scout routine.
tommy, i promised the babysitter six o'clock.
what difference does it make?
like you don't know...
men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. haven't you ever noticed?
pris.
... hi.
repoed this morning.
no, siree, it didn't. and it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and union. so --  giddyap, constitution -- and let's keep going, mr. stone.
i've got half the british government breathing down my neck. i don't have time for your nonsense.
who are you calling?
...that's probably a more appropriate analogy.
that's it.
who?
i sell bmw's. what do you do?
oh, shit.
one more reason to shoot first eh?
i'm coming with you.  besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
you're a policeman.
you on your way to trial, too, general?  or do you think they've already had our trial?
what?
not yellow, cautious.  see, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
drugs??!
i don't know, mulder.
who?  i don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
so is violating international law.
i don't know, you're not supposed to see them. they're supposed to see you.
united states marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. i have it here, in my briefcase.
let's get a couple drinks, okay?  hey, take a look behind us. do you think that car is followin' us?
you have orders, too.
we just want to guide you in the right direction.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  i have to work with him...
so what's new?
we missed the deadline.
excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in south africa?
i just said i didn't feel like raping you.
god, fred...
alright, roper. you want to come... come.
go on.
yeah, man. you were wrong, suze. my solo definitely works better in the second verse.
hello, hal.
i don't know what i'm gonna do... you know.  boy... i'm dying.
i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come.
he's the pro from dover and i'm the ghost of smokey joe.
none of your business.
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job.
we were told you could "fix us up."
most people did, yeah.
i'm a greek, thank you.  and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians.  give our new colleague some of the cretan white.  relax, tell me everything, i'm your friend.
i can't take no more of this radio...  i ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, sailor ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... i mean it!!
yeah. something slippery all over here...  tina?
fix raft first.
that's right.
no.  this is my lawyer, samuel sutherland.  i thought you two should meet.
what are you doing here?
no, just a farewell appearance, batting for sweeney. i'm going into business for myself.
ben says he and elaine are getting married.
please! you don't know what you're doing!
okay.  i've been hogging it. you're right.  _ 76.
traveling light. i like that.
it's not something he wants to publicize, ma'am.  it's just something he does.
what?
fifteen minutes ago. why don't i go in and wait?
you hold him. i'll slug him.
he's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
to make pictures.
it's much worse now. you noticed that, did you? the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didn't understand. there seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral.
i can try.
don't give me that bullshit.
you've come along a dozen times, stephen, give your brother a chance. we'll be back in a few minutes.  how 'bout it, sport?
let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
i've been in love with her since the second grade.
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case.
what's the matter with you?
what show? would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
i am.  i was just... i just got... i think i got nervous.  it's normal, right? don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
i... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
death, death.  how about the first thursday in march, ten o'clock.
you described the exact contents of my purse.
you have to get out of here.  if tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  he's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  he's such a control freak, he's even paying max to follow me around.
it's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the big con. you're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
well, vincent's american friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
thought so.  turned out he wanted me for something else though.
don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
are you quite finished with us?
they're back here.
calloway - i'm english, not irish.
you want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
dr. woodly?  you know who this is?
how much time?!
i love you! 1 want to marry you!
it's about miss kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
yes, i know, and i want you to know i thought about what you said... i know you meant it constructively but...
i'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  mayn't i come visit sometime?
well, i've flown seven million miles. and i've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. i make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. and now with this arrest hanging over my head, i'm scared. if i lose my job i gotta start all over again, but i got nothin' to start over with. i'll be stuck with whatever i can get. and that scares me more than ordell.
i know.  you're neo.  be right with you.
you already commissioned an opera from mozart.
alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later.
it's not about witches, goddamnit!
five minutes in the microwave. any one of them, five minutes and done.  ready to eat.  do you know how to make juice?
you're making this very hard. i'll be fine. really.
we heard that one already, homer.
you're making a <u>career</u> decision here, i would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
want to see my raft?
i'm not wearing any.
i told you. he already tried to contact me once. if you saw his face... he was desperate to tell me something. i owe him this.
you would?
not now.
nothing on hannah?
it started way before i was around. i think basically it's because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot. but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father.
well what?
i have a pretty good idea. ordell ain't no bootlegger and i doubt he's smugglin' cuban cigars. so that only leaves one thing an a.t.f. man would be interested in.
yes, sir.
take it easy. what could you do? i mean, she threw herself at you, right?
how come?
no.  you, i told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  and, i don't know, the movies, i don't know.  they should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
i know!
benjamin?
tommy jarvis.  we gotta do something.  he's even more powerful now that...
and you could care less --
she likes you.
it looks like the furnace.
i saw you on television yesterday.  you were brilliant.
downstairs... at the front... jesus...
at one in the morning?
you in a dance hall or somethin'? i can hear music behind you.
yeah.
do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
maybe, once.
blow me.  yellow means go, kimmy.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
one last tweak.
shut up or i'll tear you apart.
we're only one payment behind. i argued with her. it isn't right.
not me.
what... what are these interviews about?
i never *seen* her so sassy.  an' she ain't so young, neither!
and before that?
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
problems?
i need her; she's a cop.  i have to kill a cop, and then...
shhh. shhh.
oh, aye, aye.
a bruised lip.
mr. hardy?
what do you mean by that?
on it!  i'm in it ... they think i did it!
oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
i hear you.
you lost the charge?
fine, i will.
no. you can be mine!
it's done with, royce.  let it go.
he's inside you, where he hides.
yea, of course.  now where could they have put it?  on thursdays, i'm sort of lost around here.
i don't want to think about it. if i think about it he'll hear me. he'll find me.
yeah. deep south.  she laughs along with him, not sure why.
the scots will fight for us?
soon.
just take it, ok.
did you reach the next girl yet?
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters. i will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
over forty years now. me and ray gibson out there.
what the fuck is going on?
that. it's out of the act.
what about miss lawson?
i see bud because i want to.  i see bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
velma.
you get benefits?
you think i fear death? i welcome it. i get on my knees and pray for it. you, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  she’s beautiful isn’t she? you should have seen her before. flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
go! what the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? i'm ashamed. are you? well, are ya'?
you're vice, not homicide. besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
now don't you go monk'ing--
yep.  could save yourself a lot of trouble. her name's alice for sure.
no can do. life goes on, pointfive ... you left me, remember?
well... i'm goin' ta bed now.
now, really -
fine as may wine.
do his job.
i know. pull my legs. i'm stuck.
i was decorated.
because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  and i know how to handle guys like that.
ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.
alright, alright...i'll call you back.
right by the airport -- oh, amber...
then scream for me.  a repeat performance.  let me see how easy you can turn it on.  scream!  i want to hear you scream for me!
is that why you came all the way back? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood?
i'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  aren't these the greatest towels?
i can't believe that.
what the fuck are you doing?
i don't want to fight you.
when we got the grant....
make yourself at home. you done it already.
we don't know that --
what'd you rent?  best of both worlds?
city-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
naturally.
what kids?
i'm making my turn.  i see the school up ahead.
what?
you ever try to run in high heels?  you probably did.
you think people hate you.
oh, certainly. i shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  but i may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. yes, i might do that.
wait a minute. you want to go with me? you can meet my mama.
nah, let's just take a look-see.
... blind as a tiberian bat. what do you make of the plantoid beyond?
did you see his shirt?
where?... the new york times. the first one was -- "he handles produce well." which we already knew!  the point is, you have a lot of the signs.
chick only made you nuts. she cheated on you how many times?
paternity test results. christ dewey, you're never going to believe who milton's kid is.
tom...tom, i'd like you to meet kay adams.
good luck!
i got one...
i did a cross search, death certificates with this address. james and marion foster.  they had a daughter.  right here, it says james died, 1882, pneumonia. marion dies september the next year. suicide.
thank you.  i'll tell simone you liked it.
gimme that phillips right there.
i'm here.
miss dawson on the phone, sir.
between journalists and management, yes, i believe they do... but i don't take that seriously.  where do you work?
i though it was... very musical, and i liked it a lot.
this tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of sheriff hartman's bombing squad.
chub says you're fired.
i had a witness disappear on me.
these people are professionals. they don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
they sure do.
those girls drove off because of you.
go on, do it.  i don't need to hear any more.
no, no! just with her hands.
i came to talk to you.
that's the original.  there are no copies.
nlr, we think.  i wanna know...
although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
yeah sure, if i'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
do i need it?
you're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? she's ly-ing.
he was major andrew bryn-...
not listening !
i'm getting over it.  if a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
casper! was up kid?
i'm an attorney. i'm with moss, brice & fromeyer.
biggest in two battalions.
i didn't frisk him. he must have dropped it in burns' office. i didn't know whose it was.
all right. sorry, george.
wasn't my idea.
you like mysteries that much?
roy?
i know.
it's a single malt, glenmorangie. i thought you'd like it. anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
i'm sorry, daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  it's got to mean something.
now, why in the hell would you assume that?
what do you expect when you talk like that?
you didn't say anything to her?
i know.  it's so 'eighties.'  it's the cute decade.
stop tripping.
give me a minute, talk to buddy.
-- take the back -- get another car --
it's from hunger.
ambulance.
heading north still?
"thanks?"  i guess they really did fuck you up.
you can't say that for sure.  it could be a transitional thing. like a post-life crisis.  we just have to be tougher with them. come on.  have some brandy. spirits, get it?
because, i'm your attorney.  i shouldn't be going to your house.
billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
i hate this. turn that off.
admiral, this is spock.
yeah, me too. [softly] every day for the last ten years.
later for that. i'm done either way...
...huh?
fine.  the information doesn't leave this room.
what?
yes?
you wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  i got a lot of bills to pay.
i met some very interesting women at the showers. we got to chatting about this and that. you know how time files.
he did. i've seen him.
i need you so much, claudette.
comrade.
i'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
yes!
if i did, i'd have to give you one, wouldn't i? or we could take what we want. no one knows how much there is except us, right?
very well. thank you.
mrs. jensen, i've told you. you have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
okay, doll.
the admiral's son.
what do you mean, me?
i didn't. [beat] did you have anything to do with his death?
four kilos. that's what -- ten years' worth? russian sailors? mikey forrester? what the fuck are you on these days? you've been to jail, spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
oh, yeah?  terrific.
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
thank you, sir...
a weekend?
why should i worry?  is there a problem?
i ain't gonna fret you. go on!
samuel. samuel lapp.  but what happened here is none of his affair. my sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
i love this guy! 
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
what?
get me air support...  we'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
jesus christ, pop, let's go home. i got waylaid. sorry.
don't play dumb with me, mickey. you know what i mean. describe mallory.  what's up here?  what's in here?
you got my note!
i lied.
and you still believe he's going to come here?
listen to me.
well...
were.  give me the tracking monitor!
i don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
what would?
yeah, i guess so.  it was the strangest thing.  i knew what i was doing but i couldn't stop.  this really terrible feeling came over me and -- i don't know -- i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  whew!  sorry, boys.
lothar, get up here fast, and bring your first- aid kit!  i'm hit kinda bad, i think.
it's not about the money anymore. can't you see that?  it's about
he jumped. down there.  he's dead, cuervo. i did it. i killed plissken.
sir, if someone is suggesting that i'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
watch? --
it's early for him.
huh?
i'm not even supposed to be here today!
so we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. and, krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
i speak english.
i've been dreaming about that smile, ashley mercer. for a long time.
you know i was married and that my husband died. but what you don't know is i think he and i had bad luck.
i tell you what's cooking.  she made the blind see and it was a gift!  who was it from?  let's hear an 'f" for...
norman...
we need to get out of sight.  come down to my suite.
charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  i'll be in it, too, won't i?  and junior?
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
you just said...
well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
you want to know -- now -- ? here? red, white, whatever -- guys are all the same.
look, i swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and i took it from her.
dear me, the man is dense. this is a castle, isn't it? there are tapestries?
the guy on the phone.
i can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if i desire it... it's an art.  they beg for death... i keep it just out of their reach.  the pain remains constant.
listen up, jiggaboo! state of mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
i don't know. that's all he said. he wasn't very friendly. oh, yeah. he said your buddies backed down. they chickened out, he said.
i don't understand?
my kind of place. i always liked country boys.
what do you mean?
soon she’ll be everywhere.
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  i wrote colonel doolittle, and told him i needed to see you before you go.
in a way. you find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
ohhh ... dear. not another word from the shock, yes it would be.
i thought i'd start trying. if you don't mind. but i am going to florida and i do have a new nurse.
hold it!  hold it!  i think we're taking this too fast.
please, paul, 'til first light.
yes.  especially toward the end.
yeah, i have.
it doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, doc.
not all men hit.  and no one is going to hit you anymore.
izzat so?
that's young nehru. he's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. if they don't ruin him at cambridge -- wave! wave! -- he may amount to something.
you were going to get my door.
i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
a dime.
i know. but that's how it should have ended. your dad and mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
that's off now.
we'll work something out, joe.
slow and low, adam a-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  small freighters.  we've done containers...
...you don't have to think.
couple hundred on his person. those hombres would've taken the stash.
yes.
what a nerve!
yes, sire?
hey, this is perfect for you...  absolutely!  you're a woman, you're living alone now.  your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  what are you going to do?  call the police and wait until they get here on tuesday?  traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  i think not!
all right, mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  get some local people to take care of the other two.  we gotta discourage this kinda thing.
oh, that's a relief.
listen, you little worm.  i could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like i did last year, you got that?  you got that?
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
yeah, me too, mind if i tag along?
why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
shut up.
enough already about it - get to work!
so change the poster.  trust me, you'll be better off.  this is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  it's about this guy.  he's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  should he tell her? should he not tell her?  he's torn. george, this is drama.
yeah? you know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime.
yes.
it's going to be terrific.  a whole new world, new kids to play with.
you must be quite a girl.
but it's not worth more than fifteen.
ah, doolittle, i do have a malfunction on this readout, but i can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
spare me the race card, oj.  we're not going out into the sun.  it's too risky.
all but .. how <u>you</u> doing?
there are complications.
-- i know what you mean. i was there, alright. seti's place. the city of the dead.
if i'd known, i'd have fixed him up with something better.
mrs. strode, michael myers is here to kill his family.  and he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  i only thank god that i found you before he did.
nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
i ain't scared of you.
bad people.
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him? you think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
is that what he told you?
yes. actually, he was driving me crazy.
hank was always good with the ladies. always good-looking. hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
what about running number two by itself?
part of him. painless is the owner and operator of the pride of hamtrack. that's where he comes from... hamtrack, michigan.
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve.
i dunno, boy.
how d'you mean?
his victories at charleston and camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  but he has a weakness.
wonderful. except i can touch the place back there with my tongue, i wouldn't even know i had that tooth pulled.
no alcohol?
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. but he's got it, captain.
he did. captain renault did.
you're not lost.
because i...  ... because she'd never speak to me again.
it was a long time ago.-
you'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve.  there is no wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
yes, sir.
well...  i better let you...
he's clever and he's cautious in his way. if he knew i think he'd advise her to do what i want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— i don't think he knows.
it's how he works.
yeah, i guess you're right.  it's just...all so sudden...
hey, lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
lighting coghill' 5 cigar: our good colonel dumford scored quite a coup with the sikali horse.
i guess.
are you sure?
paul.
well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or indian guides--
all of which he's now missin'.
get with what?
i know everything about you, diana.
that's my job.
i -- i don't know what to say. i know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
uh, no. so you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. the question now is, do i allow you... access... to my being?
i do renounce him.
say, ni...
sorry.
let's see!
yes.
nothin' to do with it. i ain't never give john the kind of feelin' i give you, so i'm payin' him off now. don't feel you got to say anything. way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with john i just didn't.
oh.
what else?
no, sir!
no.  she tink lobo is waste of my time.  lobo don't talk.
i see. gold for ideas. you know mr. chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. whose idea was it? how did it all start?
hiding something?
everybody take five.
well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
aye. then we'll leave her be.
as long as he's been here....
i want to be alone.
boys sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
i was a hostess at this club, your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life. he asked me to come with him.  i quit my job and we've been together ever since.
stand up.
you didn't think much about that before.
where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? they all smell of moth balls.
hey.  hey.  if you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
we're fighting wind and current. i though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
that one i'm real familiar with.
just smile again and be reasonable.  i'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
why... in the heart.
what you doing to my nephew?
it's not over yet.
come on.
you know of him?
black suits you.
of course ... look, if she was a liverpool scrubber ...  eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... y'what? ... i know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. you're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
yeah, you heard of him?
what? what's this?
what do you want? my mom will skin me alive if she finds i'm out here.
i was thinking you could open another store with investors.  i'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
by you -- keitel blacksmith! don't you know, erik, that is why he went with you? ragnarok was good for his business...
he's insane or drunk or something. why, if this unfortunate man, williams, has really been reprieved, i personally am tickled to death. aren't you, pete?
you're not funny.
forty-four. they're on special this week from the canary islands. a real bargain.
i guess no one cares what i got a job.
levene!
sir!
hold still, damn it!
we need to go!
c'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over greenland, or something?
she was hurt... pretty bad.  emmett, they took the little boy with them.
well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
why aren't you at work?
dr. klenstein.  it's not a pleasant procedure, but if the ks is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
i know. i was there when she arrived.
thank you.
nothing further, your honor.
um, i think the warren commission has been closed for a while.
i like calling you david.
detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. subspace weapons are unpredictable. that's why they were banned.
okay. later.
wha-at?  what is it?
but alas poor romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter tybalt?
do you think this is a wise course of action?
a rose is a rose.
yes, william, uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...
indeed you must, baron -- you must. humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, baron, you're a thief.
how do you know she's dead.
look, they need a machine to fly.
good day, major.
the cell, mason.
bah!! 
when?
dead cat?
the nanobot... it's not here...
i told the guy i didn't want to talk to...
what do i have to do to get a straight answer around here.
you did.
the bald man! the one who tried to kill me?
was that you? i remember that. i was only three or four, but i always heard about it growin' up.  they say you're well?
i am now.  get me out of here.  just get me out of here.
run it then.
a writer's life is his work. jack kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. he's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
what the fuck?
i'm sure they do - ha ha! but i can't read their serial numbers here. so if you could read me -
he didn't.  that's your job.  i'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. good luck.  nice train.  but mine's nicer.
no...no.  nooo...it's just that i...i...uh... this ain't my car.
the teeth doin' any talkin'?
hey, i brought some friends. and some beer.
i know all that.
it was fucking '60 minutes ii'!  i couldn't say no!  i could've been the next diane sawyer!
oh please -- just till i get sleepy. then you can force me right back to my room.
ted, don't be so hostile.
i was deniro!
she's clouded your mind.  you're not thinking straight.
fine. he's very nice.
that's why it's my fault dan's dead.
i can't.
so what does that give me?  i'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
dr. argon, i know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  the situation is critical right now.  the replicators are growing exponentially.  if we wait much longer it will be too late. you have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
don't bother, sefton. i don't like you. i never did and i never will.
you're not paid to be a canary.
we are in great danger. a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft.
i don't see anything.
what?
i'm sure.
will you please take it?
you're insane.
better get him to a hospital.
thank you.
i went to my room.
shut up beavis! uh, yeah. we'll do your wife.
western hemisphere... north american continent...
i. sold the car.
you have an atm?
the tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
i don't know. she's gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
chauncey! have you seen the papers?
i don't know.....
i've eaten.
i just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
i don't know —— a witness. he seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
you'll find a good man lacy. you deserve one.
wow. you've had quite an evening.
when people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
yes. say hello to col --
yeah. i said a week, and i've overstayed myself...
no! what gave you that idea?
he's not part of the program.
how did you know gracie's pregnant? nobody knows that.
an asshole?  a swine?  a ballistic turd?  pick one.  i never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and i had to take over the company.  you see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  i'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
fantastic.  out here.
why?
denying?
you have the right to remain silent.  if you give up that right...
give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called teddy.
i'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
but not the only victim, right?
toxic dumps, huh.
they have a president. a benjamin yahoo something.
i was. but she quite outgrew the little i could show her.
a place we have, that we know is protected.
...of course...
i guess. except i'm one of the people it frightens.
the loneliness? lonely with all your gold, mister stevens? that hardly makes sense.
i feel as if i'm walking under water.
ok.
i never thought you did.
a complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. definitely not part of the big auto show. there's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
cal, stop! it was an accident.
more what?
valentine wasn't even there.  if he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  but i'll tell you something.  she stood in front of these dudes, man.  eyeballing <u>them</u>.  checking <u>them</u> out.  i felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
i put myself in his stories. i play the parts. each strumpet, each murderess.
well, thanks.
it's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
how so?
don't lie to me. i know all about it. you were seen. where did you take him?
starck, you still showing those readings?
she's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
order out like a philistine, when you got the galloping gourmet here?...
yeah. did you have them both at once or --
that's right.  maria ouspenskaya. blonde  hiya, ouspenskaya.
don't be getting' racist with me, man.
check that ego - come off it - i'm the profit - the proffesor ima teach you 'bout the worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor and he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining and if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - when the sunshine don't work, the good lord bring the rain in.
miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. if you'd only seen her, miss connell. she looked so pretty.
oh...i'll think of something... what are you doing here?
is that why she left you?
why do they tell little kids that?
because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
sure.
you first.
yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  if i can find your money, man-- what's in it for the dude?
i got this gig through a contractor. and he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
nope.
i'll pump the gas. go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
most places are, jimmy.
sometimes. when it's convenient.
i haven't felt like it.
by whose authority?
i hope you're ready for "studs," because that's what's on.
no, i don't know.  tell me.
mr greenleaf.
how will he do that?
just now.
hotel? what were they doing in a hotel?
naw, i play for the chocamunga cracker killers.  you want tickets?
i'm dealin' with what god put before me.
baseball?
can you do it mike?
his heart's beating.
the murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  the captain said--
but there is another entrance to this place.
stick around and you'll see.
the ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  if it is successful, there will be more. thank you, agent carter.
yes, right in his office, the rat. i'd like to take a crack at that guy.
of course.
you ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
well, then, it don't look good for the huskies...
i'm thirty-five years old.
we've just lost cabin pressure.
then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
who was it?
well, i know, more so. that's why i was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
amazing. i'm johns.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
better late than never.
okay, now. easy steps. easy breaths. easy steps.
yes.
help? hmm. it's possible. what did you have in mind?
i like rock and roll. no...i guess that's too mild. i love it. since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music i can really hear. and since my wife died...i dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. not always, but sometimes.  one more time--welcome to ludlow. hope your time here will be a happy one.
i'm putting it on the top step.
yes --- and that's putting it mildly! no certified check -- no story -- get me?
no, she never did.
oh, god.
why, i'm fond of thea.
let's see...international morse, i think ...k...e...o...p...e...r...e...c...a...l... l...m...i...s...t...a...k...e...o...p...e... gee, i don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
what?
that's genius.  that's genius. roger, i think i speak for mr. bloom and myself when i say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to springtime for hitler.
some time.
an accident wasn't good enough...
annie, you didn't. tell me you didn't.
may i have your name please?
was that it?
come with us, daddy. please come with us!
hello, are you still there?...uh-huh...i'll be right back.  we're still working this thing out.
yes, i am.
a planet in federation space...
because i'm interested, mrs. robinson. now what was your major subject at college?
the police department at merritsville. they called to report. the trunk was just picked up -- by mrs. anna thorwald.
probably must be.
and got well paid for it on both occasions.
no man no!! tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
you broke the radio, remember?
i'll do the work. i'm not going to meet with a therapist.
where did you say she's from?
best kind.
hello.
why do you say that?  is there something wrong?
what's he want of you?
well, no one ever spit in my face before. especially some cracker fuck.
huh?
yes.  yes it is.
do you think i would let them harm you?
she probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
you said, "will it change..." wife. will it change...
i thought that, too -- but i found that it does. come along, dance with kringelein.
she let it escape because she wants me to die.
not particularly.
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
there's no other way, lothar.  can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
you couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
may i ask... why do you cover your book that way?
you know me...
they'll wait.  meantime, raise the lid.
about an hour and a half ago. i saw her come out of a place. she said she was visiting a friend. but she wouldn't tell me who.
no dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
[not the heart, the watch.]
delay the procedure. let my people look at the technology.
all right, what do you know?
what happened?
it don't work-
wow... this one's cool.  and it looks just like a shotgun.
i like you too.
well, he's gone.
thanks!  that'd be great.
i don't know.  he sent me.  i'm george.
fine with me.
there is no us, remember?
in fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. you've just sworn to that.  isn't that right?
they seem to like the idea.
yeah. maybe.
no, kevin --  that's the whole thing, that's what i've been realizing.  that nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
you don't have to. i'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
well, then, what can i do for scotland yard?
how unfortunate. so when did you finally get to see a penis?
there was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
i was looking forward to this evening.
oh captain, that is so true.
just electra?
he said he'd prove it.
forget it, jani. it'll never work.
nuke--  good luck.
i've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
and that nasty man that followed us last night.  you didn't kill him.
...metro intelligence cop. but it didn't matter. i mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud.
so who killed him?
when's the audition?
intelligence! nothing has caused the human race more trouble. modern marriage!
daniel webster? sat here? say--that man was a great orator.
i said no.
you're quick.  mayor cobblepot.
oh?
okay.
kool-aid!? but who'd would want to -
either you are with me or against me.
she's getting steamed 'cause i'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe i should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  what'ya think?
i hope you get your work done.
why?
pierdo.
gotcha. okay. supernova bad.
i figured i'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
it didn't work out as planned. where are you off to?
well --- okay. it's a deal. one cold drink, if'n you please. in advance. one chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... that goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
i don't know. for helping me out.
you'll be leaving then.  just as well. you never were cut out for this, henry. goodbye.
no, sir.
don't be. don't be sorry for your thoughts. they make me...react. i don't know...all i know is that i can't go through another summer where i <u>almost</u> did something.
wendy...
in point of fact it didn't- but i'm convinced the idea is sound.
stop the program!  stop the program!
but of course! please make yourself comfortable. perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
missed you too, cousin.
just the same.
what's that?
all right, five hundred guineas.
yes?
i can't describe it. i think it's from the loam in the soil. this very rich, earthy kind of... alive... no. no, that's not right. can you smell it?
yeah.  so you want double condiments on that?
drunks are funny--
history.
you're totally gone, aren't you?
you're talking to the prom queen, eva. do you really think i'm going to risk getting caught?
but why?
it's saturday.
he <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. he never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. she's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
you live around here?
what about me?
how do you people expect this to work? the sheriffs have a crisis response team here.
i love you like my dad loves shelly. i wanna live here.
why not?
i can't remember. in out/out in, something like that. around eight.
what's so great about baseball?
well, i --
don't be so vain. after we found it, we made a few modifications. an extra memory port, a hidden transponder. perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i've gained access to starfleet's communications protocols. i now know the location of your entire fleet ...  you may go.
peace, good mercutio, peace! thou talk'st of nothing.
you realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  how do you expect me to find yours?
mr. stipe. a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago, in chinatown. do you remember talking to the police?
yours truly...  and he even has to write his full name...martin pauley...not even just <u>martie</u>!...  i don't care if he <u>never</u> comes back!
i told you, i'm good at this.
yes--the *benefits*! what's a man called taylor got to do with this?
if she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
i don't be-leeve this.
that's impossible.  if it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? huh?  tell me that.  it's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
it couldn't be simpler.
yeah...you want me to know i ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..you tole me that already... now shut your head!
you do?
whose number do you need?
au contraire, mon cher.
beautiful. what do you think? should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? if he's still alive.
please.  we don't need to talk about drew.
no shit.
i think he's really angry with me too.
hmm.
you didn't write that figure. and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
the tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in.  maybe more for lettin' him loose.  i was up in my cache.  saw the northland man come talk to you.
yes. he has a long journey ahead.
who cares?
yes, thanks.
it could be a million things, something in the air, food....  but he went on that ship and so did williams...  i want to examine the crew.
okay.  yeah.  we know
the point is, they are paying for information.  real information.  not tooth paste brands.  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. you are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
not much free time, gerry. lambeau have you ever heard of a man named ramanujan?
in school.
i hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
twenty-six.
doc?  ...  doc ... hello?
johnny, i know, but...
that's very nice of you. thank you.
erin --
oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you? we've discussed wittgenstein, for christ's sake. not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
talk to me, hudson.
these guys, man, they're crazy.  shit.
first of all, mr. fox, you can't just come barging in here. and what makes you think it's his birthday?
it's only two-thirty. what, are you tired?
this is april lee, auggie. april, say hello to auggie wren.
this is a very special, very old cb 275...
you said nobody would miss her.
on a good day i couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  but now, no way.  folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  bring him in yourself.
put the sense/net police on it. the matrix is their turf.
you had the whole human race pegged.
wow.
i thought he was with you.
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
hey, it's with the gods.  we don't have the money, we have to write it out.  the best or not.  and that's a lesson.  you get your typewriter yet...?
no.  something wrong with you dwayne?
for one week!
how much of a hurry are you in?
i watch him all day.  the only time i have more myself is at night.  let grandpa watch him.
ouch!  something's biting me.
honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  i tried --
mr. appleton, do you know an "albert lucas trumbo?"
what???
i'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you.
if you want your ear pierced, i'll do it.
no, i'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... i've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
get your things.
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.?
don't do that to me!
well yes, what did you think this was all about?  fun and games?
well, uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. meanin' the best. on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
looking for him for what?
how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten.
and, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. he has more concentration than anybody i've ever met. it's spooky how he can concentrate.
there.  you see the guy sitting on the porch?  the old ladies and one guy? you know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
what i am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to look out for our own...now:  they want to close down main street...
hello, baby.
look, jason, i need some fast answers if i'm ever gonna fix what i've done.
that's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
yeah, but where's the third guy?
what?
i guess i lied..you can't get both of us out of here, can you?
there is no alternative.
maybe miss wolf has them.
why don't you shut up now.
are we going to argue?
there's gotta be something. we have to dig deeper.
what shape is the scar?
why not?
six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
i wouldn't do that.
aw, come on, kid. throw me a bone. i'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
- we made a fire.
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
nothing. as before.
his file listed you as a known associate.  now spill.
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, ben, be a man and just get it over with. i would have if i'd had the chance.
there is no problem.
so he says now! but if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
you caught me on an "up" day.  how about you? how did you end up in san francisco?
now you're angry.
romeo tango zulu, copy one the television, graphics of the first family against the presidential seal.
thanks, guys.
c'mon. talk to me. tell me what you're thinking.
oh louis, i just don't know about this--
doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
well, bill -- mind if i call you bill?  let me be frank. i've made a lot of money. i've got my own business in detroit. rivets. i make rivets and sell them to fisher body.  well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. when my business manager told me i should shelter some money, i thought i'd try this.
we'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  you think i can get in that poker game, eddie?
it is.
the point is that i don't think napoleon will sit in moscow until the spring!  i don't think he can afford to.
soviet russia will put all its might behind this case.
get lost!
nossir.  i'd gone to tell the wid... to tell mrs. heine.
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, i'd worry.
i wanted to talk to you,  i wanted to tell you about the other children.
the torture of small children--
i don't want to rattle you, but dee was here for the war of the worlds.
hold up a sec...
but there's no more drug.
what was i trying to say? oh, yes, i think, we think, or at least i suppose we think -- am i right?
mainly.  and also that i'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
mrs. christian, tom welles here.
do we have to?
well, you showed them. you're rich and famous and successful. and you have a beautiful wife.
kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  why don't you throw in another shark?
oh, well, i'm goin' uptown, too.
we don't want to tire you out, dear.
we have to stop meeting like this.
okay?
it has nothing to do with you.
a shark attacked thea and some kids...she's going after it....
i say a lot of things.
i know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled al's gonna set out an' look for him. how 'bout gas, tommy?
her name's inez. stop calling her the housekeeper.
there has to be!
good.  that was the plan.  we couldn't stand him and george needed help.
well, i mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  how shall one say, director?
you have to karl. you have to look out for me. you don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
why are you doing this?
oh yeah? i mean i know.
i'm not scared, buddy.  you don't understand.  they're playing for keeps, buddy.  the press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
the genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. but at the rate things are going now...
yale thing?
i played the cards i was dealt, wyatt.  your problem is you're always trying to play someone else's.  allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free: there is no happiness, wyatt there is no normal life.  there's only life, that's all.  just life. the rest is relative.
how did you know!
please, sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. if you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
was he with anyone?
what have you been doing?
it was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but i understand you're a difficult man to see.  i thought you'd have the solution by this time.
why me?
somehow, i don't think that was walt whitman.
it's my father. he gets it from his doctor.
yes.
you should have told me.
you go dry off now.
tomorrow.
what're you, nuts?
what are you talking about?
exactly.
i think that's for the best.
to new worlds...
...yeah, okay.
you glad?
in exchange for endowments. they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
what?
you don't understand.  you don't know what's going to happen.
i thought i was doing you a favor.
you think i'm pushy now, wait 'til i get you on the stand...
you're so nice. 
-- you can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
no you're not. how... nice one. how dumb do you think i am ?
vegetable meaning paraplegic.
why, it's an artistic institution—
i'll light the lamp.
what did she say?
the best defense is offense.
we had a date.
...alright, let me know when.
okay, sweetheart. well, i have to go now. tell mommy that i called.
others are waiting.
he can't be far away.  find him. go!
you just might.  i'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  at the time, i was bald with a beard, no moustache, and i had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, i won't be offended.
what do you want with those two medical officers?
an hour ago. <i></i> i tried to prepare myself, but i didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. i can't even bear to look at him... how about you? you're okay?
yeah, eddie was a real character.  had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes.
don't mention me.
good night cecile.
you got that right.
sure.  just a minute.
there is no baer/grant publishing without alan baer.
there we cannot help you.
yeah, honey, let the kid watch t.v. hell, let's all watch t.v. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
your stereo broke? god, i could hardly stand that. i live on music.
yes.
does osborne agree?
just from his agent.
yes?
damien karras.
far enough. maybe up to san francisco. or st. louis, someplace new. start over.
impossible!
why don't you just shoot him now? here, i'll get a gun. we'll just shoot him. bang! dead. done.
you killed them.
it's bob's, the day manager's.  he's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
i seen your fucking face.
but they told me it was ee gor.
you heard the sergeant. outside.
i remember you...in the elevator.
[the car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
well i know how it went with cecile. she won't shut up about it. how'd it go with mrs. jesus?
don't hold me so tight.
well, what marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
i can go to the bar.
fine.  everything much the same.  when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately.  whereas you... i've watched in wonder.  awards, glory ...
said, a person's gotta make a living.
what happened to you after ...
the premiere. i never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
...i know this must look... funny.
i wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
she has died.  you are the next to be called.  why do you think you were sent to me?  trained as you were?  you bear the mark.
yes, i'm pretty amazing. you should see this...it came this evening.
she'll never call again.  she called last week to tell me she'll never call again. where's sally?
looks like you'd make a good runner.
somehow, i don't see that happening.
thanks.
well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, i'm, like, a comedian-
then let's get started... it's senseless to waste any more time.
yeah?
if i had pulled the trigger, sybok would be dead.
--personal rivalry? i'm not getting back at you.
but where?
i need you.
well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. on a balance i reckon i'd choose being a cow.  would you mind passing that salad young lady?
everyone has to follow his own plough. a man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. city people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. you don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  it's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. you sell it to a stranger. you worked your whole life, for what?  i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. all what we've experienced has no meaning.
i don't want to scare you. i want to be yours, and you mine. every night like this one.
stop crowdin the plate!
you weren't disappointed in her, then.
don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
hello.
m-m-m-mack?
blow out the candles!
michael, take it easy.
because i took it out of your memory.
if you believe in voodoo.
it won't work on you.
-- but they got it all wrong.  any fool can figure it out.  spider-man nailed this guy!
i just need to talk.
well of course i'd want to give her that.  i mean, what do you think, i don't care about her?
shermin...
i did tell you, didn't i?  that i'd be ready to start the berlin model today?
i'm too tired for this now.  i know i'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up?  i need to be able to think while i do it and i can't think while you're here.
it was the experience of a lifetime.
but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.
i am selena. give him to me. now. or you'll both be sorry.
man.  fuck you guys.  i have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
what's with you?  every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
we was born to die, boy.  from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  you just don't know where, or when, or how.  don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
i can't say.
shit!
let's go.
it sure is.
yes, miss.
shut up! this is a professional relationship!
it's a lie!  you're a deserter! you're an impostor, sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
i have a sore throat.
take it.
you found him.
what happened to jim?
you're boring me. i have a husband. i don't particularly feel the need for another.
i guess.
then why are you still looking at me like i'm asking for the square root of something! what did you say!?
well, i wouldn't mind.  but my name's daniel stone.
well thank you, hun. that's real good of you to say. i wouldn't know what to do without him either.
i'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
well, i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
no, we're not!
thirty-five.
love holds you to me. and we are in danger, not you.
and that's why you're losing your bet?
nobody cares about me at home. they wouldn't even miss me.
you kill me, you sign your death warrant.  and hers.
okay.
i'm better than that.
then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
pheromones?
that's what it cost, david.
wait a sec. i want tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
i had no idea you'd be this good!
i'm not sure what --
somebody told you.
we're what!?
we're -- conducting a new experiment.
that i would find the one.
where i come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
don't do this to me now, joel. really.
yeah.
i am ergo the magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
i killed them.
do you know where she's staying in hawaii?
my wife.
larry young, a california lawyer--
have you.
right!
oh -- you would!
now that's more of what we're looking for.
bless the maker and his water... bless the coming and going of him.  may his passage cleanse the world.
i'll just try the first one.
want to what?
now that it's out of your system.
ah - sweet transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  to take that step to the right...
how is that?
you mean she bit you?
leavin', boy?
pain? oh, no, doctor. i think if i had pain i'd be too happy to notice it...
thought so.
where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
okay.
mr. hadden, i'm a scientist; i don't make deals... but.  if you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
long enough.
no.
when was that?
...of possibly working together.
yes. i don't remember where agnes was. i was needed in the sick room.
everything about what?
could this be a trap?
i'm asking it.
i'll try, captain.
it's okay.
i'm on my way to chicago. very important meeting tonight. well -- any new developments?
do?
she really say she was pregnant?
what did he buy?
no.
that case, i tell you what you do. you go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. not the motel, that's the other end of town. this is the hotel. now you take a right turn there, you got that?
had enough ... ?
well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
what did he say to you in french?
--admit what?  that i was right about you in the steam room?  that you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
let it go, captain.
paul, can you hand me the olives? ruth, i need you to, what was it?
who?  martin... he’s martin...
yes.
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians.
very sweet.
jeez, that thing... can't you...
oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...you're late.
epps.  what if they're not saudi.
and if you didn't believe me?
i'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
no. don't stop.
you're getting a workout, you and captain forrest, your first night.
i'm not a podiatrist, i'm a cardiologist.
wear it until you love it.  and die in it!!
i have nothing to do. i'd like to help you.
i bet your parents were happy to pay.
i just joined up.  but i'm quitting! i got a trial membership!
i'm staying right here. doing my job. fighting to get my show on the air. you don't like it? hey, i'll tell you what... fire my ass...
timex...
he must be replaced.
listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
what? forget it.
...what? what did you call me? george... mccord. you're my favorite actor on...
so is this.  come now, you're upsetting the little one.
help me put him back in his chair.
when we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
we'll just be a minute.  get a little more sleep.
what does that mean?
almost three hours.  but i've been getting ready all my life. 
i answer to grissom, punk.  not to you.
hell...
he couldn't get through the door, then?
just now...
you knew?
i want you to know... i don't know.  i just think you're a hell of a guy.
yeah.
damn. your dad did this?
who? applejack?
where are your bills, carl?
hey, ang'...
that's the boardwalk, sam.
what are you, a cop?
is that a fact.
sir, let those laugh that win.
he's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  he can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
yeah. tv busted?
sorry jeanne...  did you both meet already?

indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
motherachrist...

like hell. play the goddamn tape.
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore.

if you want...
only from a distance.
maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  and then i gotta explain about the homeless...

my lawyer went over this beforehand.
and you think it's worth all this?
i'll see yuh.
) what do you think?
we live in 703.
checking........
breathe, carl. four, nice, deep ones.
you haven't told me everything.
all hands, brace for impact!
sure, what do you want to know?
then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
are you a virgin?
you look good yourself.
i am sorry.  sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  it's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
roth got out on a private boat. he's in a hospital in miami.  had a stroke but he's recovered okay. bussetta's dead.
it's more than they thought. they're going to stop chemo.
your raoul?
well.  congratulations.
bad fuckin' news.  even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  it'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in.
how about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
yes, i'm with the underhills.
no, the reason i ask is--
i know how you feel about me, but i'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
he took his stuff. he's gone.  i should of seen this. i should of expected it. bob doesn't have any character.
tonight we open new doors.
no harm, no foul. but you want to watch out for that road. those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
i, um, need an estimate on some jewelry i might wish to sell. but d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because i don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
that's going to fit me?
it's true. i can't live without you.
so all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be. then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite--
i haven't seen you around here before.
please.
those people?  i doubt they'd think of this.  ooo, you're wonderful this color!
do you know where she would be?
but what -- 
let me finish, dear.  you had your say, now let me have mine...
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs - giga electron volts.
yeah? give me a goodbye kiss.
why am i so--that's new--the way i figure it is if i can get through to just one camper...then i'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] don't get caught. i'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is. look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't i come through for you? ain't she stepping in style now?
they recruited me. promised me fast advancement.
why not?
mr. carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
well, anyway... sorry.
okay. go ahead. i'll settle up for the beers...  an' walk rayette over with you, will you.
i don't know.  it would be small, easy to transport and hide.  gold or jewels. probably gold.
there's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  and you blew it for 'em.  now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, i'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  i've got no feelin' for you.  but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance i can actually do them some good, or i'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  that's a sincere promise.
that is my least vulnerable spot.
i'm not sure i'll last all week.  i'll tell steve.
it was good of you to meet...
parlay!  i invoke the right of parlay!  according to the code of the brethern, set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew, you must take me to your captain!
no, no, please! it is not a holy relic.  you know we have met already? in this very room. perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  he was giving the most brilliant little concert here. as he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. my sister antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? jumped straight into her arms and said, will you marry me, yes or no?
i mean it, grace.  i'm getting out of here, and i want to take you with me.
actually, i volunteered.
restaurant.  let them know we're running late.
yeah, the best.
oh, you've already met rick, mademoiselle?
they're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
what does it say?
i put up new drapes, jake.
just what army do you think the colonel was in?  everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the klan.  "special recipe".  i'm telling you.  there's something in the batter. say it makes a black man sterile.
shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. gettin' some work at las'.
oh, me -
give the man a hug, boy!  that's your father!
i'm a gambler -- i'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, i really belong in jail
we've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  i'd like you to go with her.
i'm sorry about luther.  he was the best street worker i ever saw.
i think you know, frank.
it happens to be a matter of life and death.
i pray to god there is.
have they?
yes.  mmm.  yes.  precisely. precisely. 'cause your partner depends on it.  i'm talking to you, i'm trying to tell you something.
really?  how?
shit. sarah darling.  i interviewed her too. god, it's happening again isn't it detective?
you're here because you figured i might show up.
i am arthur, king of the britons.
how is it this hag knows the truth?
look i know what i'm doing. i have experience and training in space walking.
you know, i've got a perfect little spot here for "brian mccaffrey, fireman"...
i killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... i left nothing for you!
lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman!
what does he want. the russian shithead. what do you want ?
a camp! well!
well, how do i know who you are?
captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
he's learning his letters.
can you spare three hundred? pay you back next month, promise.
all men are cheats.
that's okay. i've already had lunch.
not very well, i'm sure.  i'd probably start doping myself.  or maybe i'd...
fixing it?  but i fixed --  where'd you get all that?
what...
you fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? the union ain't gonna like it.
oh yes... they found our knowledge useful for a time.  they used us much as your people did.  then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
i thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
do me a favor.  don't pretend for a second that you and i don't know the truth.  you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want, but i was there.
could be.  across the river into zululand. . they might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
oh, yes. i heard.
i can get into the den.  the office is right across the hall.
oh. all right. i'11 watch at home, then.
uh uh.
she's involved with these drug dealers.
one day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. the first saint of our century. that's a prayer, too. a catechism. something the priests tell us to believe.
sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
"ride the clouds". good picture.
i love secrets.
they are here!... your jewels!... here in paris!
maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
thought i'd take a walk. any law against it?
i don't want to go to vanderbilt.
yes, sir.
we named the dog indiana.
yes.
what do you mean???
that's bensinger. that's his desk.
the chest! the chest that i put my papers in.
and all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.

i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can't i?
without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
we have become aware of these concepts only recently. in our dealings with sarris. often sarris will say one thing, and do another. promise us mercy and deliver destruction... it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris.
of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... arnold is a man and will understand.  what i need to understand is, john, sam... what is happening here?  who are those people in there?  the fat ones in silk?

well we got some workin' money anyway.
i kinda doubt it.

irena.
this is no joke. if some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
yeah.
are you ever going to tell the truth about me, mr. taransky?
in a month.
yeah.
uh, alex, we've only know each other one day.
our penguin, right?
please be quiet for a while, would you?
tolerable well.
will you lead me to her?
i like you. that's the thing about my psychic thing. i think that's my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you're a really good guy.
i always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
just what makes you so popular?
oh my g-d, how embarrassing were they? i wanted to shoot myself.
nonsense. we came here to find the american dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. you must realize that we've found the main nerve.
that's right.
bye, stephanie. bye, siena, caryl.
i...

thanks.
where's the dock ?
perhaps i did... until fear turned into panic. that’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “you don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “we’re in deep trouble,” he said. “we,” he said. “we.”  we’d both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. we had to stop you and friedman meeting...
you changed cabs? you're sure no one followed you?
yes.  but alfred's condition is less severe.  freeze's research says he cured a case like alfred's.  it just doesn't say how.
one thing at a time.  we don't even know what it is yet.
much better.
sonic death monkey.
--turn the camera off--
yeah, you gotta go 'yeah', strength.  poor little man.
senta. we have to ask you to stay in rome.
so, <u>we know</u>.  we know it went through a black hole.  we saw it.  norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  it'd go in some report like some big discovery.  so in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>but they didn't</u>.  the called it an unknown entry event.
tell you what.  if this thing burns us, i take that heat.  i give you permission to point your finger at me and say "it was all his idea."
oh, my god!!
loretta.
i've got a lot of thinking to do.  'sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
one hundred percent.  and i like him that way.
sure, see you later.
yeah.
my god.
decidedly. yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
no, sir.
almost.
you weren't looking for company, were you?
not me, bones... they did it.
look, chum, this is a guy, from what i understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? island hopping, practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth.
andy? andy is that you?
yes!  i've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize i've got to take action.  goodbye, penis!
walt!
then why do you want me to lay down to them?
i care.  don't you know what caen's famous for, sarge?
was it davy crockett or jim bowie?
enthusiastic?
yes, can i help you ? maybe a donut or something ?
that's what gordon's always saying.
good god.
it's ok.   it's good to let it out.
no.
that's okay. it's not really my business. i have wondered though. why was it? was it like a nervous breakdown?
hello. i just met amy and she pointed out where you live.
just...images, really. feelings.
is that what she used to sing?
come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
i need to talk to annette.
i'll take you down there.
oh yes.
what <u>kind</u> of stuff?  hello...?
how much?
i'm sorry, inspector, i don't know much about..
mine, too.
who's up for a night on the town.
i don't know if whoopi is the way to go.
keep your voice down.
..harmonica style is okay.
i want to go to an east coast school! i want you to trust me to make my own choices.  i want --
you're kidding.
baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
later for that, walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "old mill"...alright?  we need a new title, we need a...
her?
nothing personal --
it's only our first date.
i told you -- he and i were old friends --
good-bye!
'cause if you say another word, i'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
it - it feels like - like i'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   like i'm fading away-
you know, i jus' can't remember when i felt so good before!
i want to go home.  i don't like it here.
[you tell me.]
that's three. nobody should have more than one talent. okay, do an impression.
well hurry then, and get it.
what's a metrix?
you're not cured yet, my boy.
just like old times, ain't it?
he just needs some clothes?
one day he's gonna find out what we're up to with mr. reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
shut up!
then why are you eating alone?
this is crazy. we're loosing our first strike capabilities!
just get me some horses.
i can see. and you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
hey... hey where are you going?
what?
it's a big part of the show.
your back? did you fall?
it's okay.  forget it.
sure thing. please don't worry about me. can i help you with the dishes?
jack, if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
what do you mean?  you said you wanted to see me.
sean, i really don't think you understand--
oh, don't worry. you won't...
i don't know...
it's left its mark still. the last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. take them into town. get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. it's good medicine.
who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
i didn't do anything --
dehydration.  vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency.  any or all of the above.
ray, think about how she looked when you married her. think about how happy you were. don't lose that, man. don't give up everything.
he might be.  i don't know.
no, i will.  i don't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you.  you're a liar, and a thief.
is he okay?
i've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  shit, my grandma used to say, "which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." no, wait. i fucked up. she said "what's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
yes. my treat.
it isn't... ?
so where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
i am?
i studied the diagrams.  but you hid the details!
how am i going to conduct an interview if i can't ask him any questions?
... we've got a committee meeting.
i tell you, we're going west, and shanghai is east of here!
never had to.
who's sonny chiba?
quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. go -- go at once, -- mr. preysing --
yeah. my name's not john ultramalensky and i wasn't at your wedding.
how could you have been so stupid?
that kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. no, i think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. i must have been an antelope or an ibex. what times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
as a tumor.
are you?
what's your name?
what?
yeah. it's pretty good.
book of jeremiah.
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife? to his daughter?  i will stake my reputation that barnes didn't kill those guards.
let's do the small talk in the car. load up.
then bugger me!
let's just say it's what's best for the country.
what the fuck am i afraid of?!
i'm very proud of him.  he's been through a lot in his life. a lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. a couple i'd thought had broken him... i mean emotionally.  they were bad... but he made it. yes he did.
why not?
how would <u>you</u> know, what--
oh, it totally does. i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing. but you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
i think his family wants this kept quiet.
very good. now we play round 2.
what's the point?
then you're going to have to dye it, anthony. we've got to hide our identities. especially after bob crashed the car.
yeah.
...doris--
with the emphasis on self, and in selfish, right?
i did not know him before i married him. i loved his brother, but then, i married his brother, too. he is dead now.
how do you know what i'm going to say?
general korrd's military strategies were required learning when i was a cadet at the academy. when they put me out to pasture, i hope i fare better than korrd.
you know that was like a quadruple negative?
mike's out -- i think he went to silver meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
she is much younger than i am. that's something i'm going to have to get used to. isn't it, larry? they'll all be much younger than i am. here.  tear them up.
you are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
i've got one now.
what the fuck is going on there?
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  if we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
but, sir...
it's not a matter that concerns you, mr. torrance - at least not at this point.
what do you mean?
i shouldn't, mike, it's a weeknight.
i'll get it.
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
what's your name?
gopher, everett?
call the police.
what is it?
search me.  i mean - i'll see.
thirty-two.
only give me leave to ride out again, to do what i am most able to do, and happiest doing.
at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
and your husband works for somebody else.
it's the scientific method. it's all the rage.
right.  auto-shop, you all set?
right again. you're no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.
you've got to tell me what she said.
you're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
how's your hernia?
i swear, i don't know this girl.
he said if i told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
they all kick out.  you run in streaks, pal.  streaks.  i'm... i'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  shelly levene.  anyone. ask them on western.  ask getz at homestead.  go ask jerry graff. you know who i am...i need a shot. i got to get on the fucking board. ask them.  ask them.  ask them who ever picked up a check i was flush. moss, jerry graff, mitch himself...those guys lived on the business i brought in.  they lived on it...and so did murray, john. you were here you'd of benefited from it too.  and now i'm saying this.  do i want charity?  do i want pity?  i want sits.  i want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  give me a lead hotter than that, i'll go in and close it.  give me a chance. that's all i want.  i'm going to get up on that fucking board and all i want is a chance.  it's a streak and i'm going to turn it around.  i need your help.
i don't know.  i once asked dr. maxwell the same question.  he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
it gets worse.
jesus, she's my best friend.
good idea.
don't you even think about it.
sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
may i ask a question?
nothing... i promise-nothing...
ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
and your point?
like a haunted house, right?  i don't believe in ghosts.
there you go again. stop saying that. you can make it.
play a song then
okay, babe.  what's the matter?
just a few loose ends to tie up. dougherty out.
i don't know.  it probably would've been the same.
what a spectacular view.
fine.
yeah, although it's put an end to the stanislavski catering company. which is why i have to speak to you. and...  you're gonna get impatient, but...i have to borrow some more money. 
you're absolutely right. the focus is on the college admissions process today.
what d'you know about how joanna felt?  you went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
i remember that night.  d'artagnan was drunk, the only time i've seen him that way.  the three of us were reveling, remember, athos?
that where he was shot?
you ruined my life, mister... me and my wife... and i am going to ruin yours...  you don't have to go out there to see that girl. we been going four years.  four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
...and i have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
why should i ?
the past fifteen minutes.  it seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? they strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
orthopedics?
don't belong?
holden caulfield?  <u>catcher in the</u> <u>rye</u>?
damn you, blair!  you've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
every damn day.
you think you could make an exception just this once, boss? she came all the way down from new york.
bad place, man.  bad people.  some guys loading some trucks.  some kinda deal goin' down.  i don't know and i don't care.  maybe they're shipping fava beans to eskimos.
lady patrizia!
she's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
i can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
maybe the owners are from texas.
i knew you'd want it again...
and a share. we will be partners, mr. fennyman!
it's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- i'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
more so than the shark?
he could've monitored the calls on a scanner. did you call her from the set?
that's not what he meant.
you are the man who wrote this letter. you are the man who has come back to lead us. you will soon have great responsibilities. you must know what to do.
chet, i am calling you from portland... oregon.
no, i don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  my whole interest, if it's not too late, is in susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
syevodnya
it says, "ray."
answer them and quit kicking me!

edgar william jacobi, aka william edgar bright, a.k.a. moloch.

oh, some insurance man. are you in?
i -- i thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
how about a passive radiation scan?
thanks, stan. i owe you.
hello.
nah, it probably won't turn up anything. i'm just gonna talk to him.
wait --
the wallet! he took derek's wallet!
gimme a break.
 where are my feelings... i feel for no one...
i know about your fucking condition, leonard! i probably know more about it than you do! you don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
yes, your majesty.
so you're saying that ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? he just wanted to fuck around?
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
you don't say.
well, it's a good morning, anyway.
it is.  go on, mr. thatcher -
i don't trust anyone.  that's what comes of working in television.
look, can we talk in a minute? i'm almost done.
girls, this is sister mary clarence. she'll be minding you until sister mary patrick's return.  mary clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  do not attempt discussion.  am i understood?
francis, may i ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
why do people think i'm you?
seven fingers...ay-eh...seven...
doesn't matter. game's over.
there's an air-lock.
we haven't slept in the same bed for years.
we didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
go back to sleep.
close!
you're great with the advice, clark. maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
no, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, i just stay at the four seasons. it's easier.
because i don't have to.  the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  and by the way, they call it acheron now.
uh... i've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... i graduated today.
there's no room.
yeah.  i suppose he is.
we like you, leon -- don't we like leon?
six ayem.
yer damn right.
sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  as for a photo -- if you can't do it, i know twelve million people who can.
bon jour.
defuse the bomb.
well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
i just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
you can heat them up and eat with him.
oh, i think you can do it. probably.
i hear good things about the new play.
how did you get in here?
ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  you must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
well, i'm fully covered.
you should be thanking me.
well i parked illegally. see y'later?
save yourself. master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned.
it might still be worth trying riki-tiki- tavi.  r...t...t...there's only three combinations of -- t...t...r, or t...r...t...
that's right. you're going to rio. rio de janeiro. on your own. come on, you should know. you bought the fucking ticket.

whee, you shoulda told me it was tony lacey's party.
that guy, the one that died.
yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. cory does that to me when i hyperventilate.
and has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
oh, here you are, justice zinnowitz -- i'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
it's okay.  she scrambled the transmission.  luther, continue feeding the gps her position.

don't kill me. oh shit, please no. i'm rocco. i'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
suppose someone knows about the money?  they're bound to ask questions.
congratulations.
sit in this chair, and i'll pose you.
okay.  i think that's all we need to know.
no.  have a look.
i understand.
there was no card.
get it while you're young.  and you better fix your lips.  you want to look nice for osgood, don't you?
i like the sound of that.
i would if i knew where i was taking him.
well, i'm not.
my father always said to me, 'son, don't invest your money in anything but land. land! stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'remember that ,' my father said. 'land."
i know you'll be.  three hours.
this guy laplante won an award?
don't let me die, epps.  i don't want to die.
did he tell you about my party?
canelo!
george bailey. yes, tonight's his crucial night. you're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. whose turn is it?
i don't think we'll go to war.  we shouldn't even be here.  this isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  it should be decided regionally.
l-l-lyndon johns lyndon johnson is a politician. you know the ethics those guys have? it's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
not today, burgel.  send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for god's sake don't bother me today.
you play an instrument?
that are called rommel or something, i guess not that many. 
and get someone to help around the house.
no, you don't.... if you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. you know what tefillin is? tsitsis? shotness? you know the kaddish from the kiddush?  eichmann? he went to israel. he studied the torah, the talmud, the mishnah, the whole bit. he hated jews.
how do you know? you know her that good?
we'll finish it tomorrow... goodnight, bobby.
i'm loving this. it's such a treat to be out and about. what a wonderful invention a city is. the immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
shall i?
i wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
i think it was a disgrace.
keep this job, ya eat better.
vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
adam! calm down.
it's his show for now.  look, you want to get some dinner?  inter- agency cooperation and all?
until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
but how?
well, mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if i were a woman and i...  were not around, i should be in love with rick. but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
your mother met her?  can i talk to your mother?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
fill 'er up.
too bad... thought they were harkonnen.
yeah?
are you there, sir?  we're going...
i know who he works for. where's your phone.
don't blame yourself, you did what i told you to do.
no!  spies or something.  and harry from work...get down!
fine.
you aren't going to the party?
i don't want to.
what are you doing at the office? you wouldn't believe what i've gone through tonight... i'm calling from the mega beta pogo sorority.
no. that's cool. bring me back eighty.
today i'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, nancy thompson.  let's make her feel welcome.
in a way, yes.
excuse me.  i got a bullet in my leg.
daphne.  another guy came in asking me about her, too.
haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word i said? ...oh, i'm sorry. can i say fuckin'? i can't, can i?
he gave acosta's people a receiver.
you have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
ohm i would have been... one marriage ago.
i'm sorry, but i am waiting for an associate.  can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
learning our history! the last 5000 years that she missed! she's been out of circulation a while, you know.
no.
i never laid a hand on her in anger. not a day. not even when i's drinkin'. but this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
but i have to know.
it's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--i mean--in case i act sort of strange--it's the suit.
you mean profanity. that's simply the way they talk here. nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. you'll find it in all the literature of the period.
mr. nixon.
are you hunting wabbits ?
hobbs was insane. he was attacking college girls and he killed them.
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out. i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
i don't know what these cops got to do with it but i don't like it.  an' these here are our own people, all of 'em. i don't like this.
was i?  i'm sorry.
oh no, rob, that's not obvious enough. not at all.  dick, did you hear that?
what do you do with the company, if i might ask ?
basically, i'm completely smitten with you, and i don't care if i'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
the glucose will begin working in half an hour. you'll feel better then...
what the hell you doing?
why?
i'm going to level with you officer.
we need to talk.
ray --
something came up, murman, my man.
he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly.
somewhere.
listen, he's my brother and i don't want to start trouble...
i'm not sure that's possible.
i'll take care of that.
i been thinking. i hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
i know!  you can't imagine how surprised i was.  who would think you could find anything divine on the upper east side.
you don't remember you did.  but i'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry, don't you?  you remember that.
she's coming. charley vidal gave her a lift.
jim please --
no, really -- i'm crazy about you.
that's terrific.
don't be cruel.
it's this big hole.  you could almost see bone.
what are you talking about? it's 11, i've won. with this lady.
and english, and trig
you try that you little monkey.
easy, johnny.  now ain't the time.  i tell you, boys, even i'm worried what'll happen once ringo runs this outfit!  god have mercy!
dismiss the company.
that's right.
cq what?
we should leave the past alone.
it is.  yes -- that's where they had rorish, for god's sake, before they made him anchor.  i can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
'gonna wait outside.
but a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
jack wade. citibank. commercial loan division. if you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
good guess -- but no.
you've got a gun, haven't you, chad? will you let me have it?
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
not to worry. so... see you tonight, right? right?
no. no, i guess not. i don't want to get bruised. you're right, i should go.
well?...
worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
man, i hate work even when somebody else does it!
they are?  i'll be damned.
crazy with greed. not crazy. not like him.
too many people. come on!  shields!!
no way.
i just wanted to congratulate you. you did it.  you've created a world without murder.  so what if you had to kill someone to do it.
don't worry about the loans. i'm doing good dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
yeah, i just came in. i decided not to park here.
there's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work.  but what the hell, jack, i guess you deserve it. right's right.
thank you for loving me.
what?
think about it.
now ask him who his mother was.
enough for everybody to breathe?
i left like an hour ago.
what will they be made of?
well i bet you they're happy.
it's okay. they pre-order. there's a choice of three entrees.
no, you won't. you'll die of cold out there and then i'll have to feel guilty. and i've already got more guilt than i know what to do with. [beat] do you want something to drink?
certain?
hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
...that's what it is.
watch it, archer --
perhaps the police?
they've hit us on cherry hill. i just got word. we have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
i'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  i've got a lot going for me.  i'm going places.  i'm going to be someone.  i'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if i have to kill to do it.  i'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. i don't even know why i'm wasting my time here with you.  i should be with my people...
that's what i said.  is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
lemon it is.
no.  we go straight.
say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? let me alone!
sure i do.  but the bet defense is a good offense, right?  you're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
i know...i know.
not without jamie.
huh?
crash override.
excuse me?
is that a threat?
no.
you are the wisest person i know.
i wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
how many times have you done this? i'm interested.
good evening, commander. everything ready?
i think about you. i mean, a lot.
you lost ben?!
relax!
they're called subways. a nickel will take you from one end of manhattan to the other. helluva ride, too.
one too many safes dropped on his head?
i'm so sorry, kalen.
well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
carl can wait.
you mean for you.  a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. and you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  this isn't going to work out.
it doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
after the market, you followed me to the hotel.
alright. you want some pie?
shit all looks the same here --
that's right. how' you doin', barney?
i'm guessing no.
yeah, right.
no speeches!  what's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
at the risk of sounding stuffy, jeff -- i'll remind you of the constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim. he must ask for evidence.
yes.
i don't like them.
let me have that one. where's the nearest hardware store?
all i wanna do is tell stories.  the things i find interesting...
oh, no place as wonderful as this. agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
i don't want to be a martyr.
he's here.
cool.
fuck how they operate. just do it. like your man says, "by any means necessary."
clark kent, if you had only seen it the way i did, you -
just a cold. the doctor says it's nothing serious.
i'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
what is it?
she'll be away on friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt.  if she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  she'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
what you mean?
what's it like where i'm going?
how long have i been here?
condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
yes sir...
of course. of course.
they said it was here. they told me this morning.
i can't do that, bob.
have you slept with him yet?
norman.
any books you like to read for fun?
i feel different right now.
italy!
i see them!  i see them! rd street	pasadena 57
are you frightened?
what little boy doesn't...  my god...it's, it's...catwoman.
well it's just one of those things. you know... purely an accident, um. my husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. it's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured danny's arm.
they're just leftovers.
remember when i told you my dad was in hell?
you asked me if i would --
i apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  disaster...
i found dad.
hi, i'm-i'm tony lacey.
the day i left you i just drove and drove. i drove all day and all that night, and i didn't go anywhere. i just kept driving. i stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and i sat --
well, i'm-i'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
i know... but i'm a little pressed.
i'm here.
how'd you get in here?
whose then?  lindsey?  talk to me...
i didn't create this world of ours! i only record it!
not you. some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
back against the bars.  now.
who's coming?
what is it?
i'm willow ufgood.  i'm here to find fin raziel.
my lord.
how did you know?
get out of here.
if you want to do it.
you know me?
come on, man, i'm telling you what you already know.
what?
you're very smart, joey, very smart. nobody gives me a straight answer around here. you're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. did you fuck vickie?
the one who lives in the white house across the bay?
why am i doing this? why am i here?
cause i'm tired of bein' his nigger.  i want you to help me break him.
i want ta tell ya one last thing before i pull the trigger.
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. if we don't blow them - who will?
it wasn't me.
it's really nice, tommy. can we go home now?
shut up.
she got me at a more impressionable age.
wait a minute.
have a nice day  sir
tell me how.
i said back away.
you took me to the house.
nowhere in particular.  don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
now let's get down to business.  kuato wants what's in quaid's head.  and he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  now i have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --do you think you can play along?
i like your outfit. you got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
it's not real?  crain?  he's not real?
and i don't like what we've become.  i'll cover any losses you have on this one.  now get out, you asshole!
shut up!
for the time being.
damn straight. i expect those pittsburgh crawdads to remember that.
you're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
no, i need'm now!
smoking?  i'm not smoking.
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
you're being narrow-minded.
my mother and i used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  get in the fucking car.
shhhhh...
meaning...
i still don't know what you're getting at. right now i want to take my nap. it's important that i-
i'm just temporarily off my game.
i'm not rich people.
yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  but that's all it is. mystery.  not malice.  what, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
yeah, but didn't you love vanessa when you married her? if you love someone once, you can love them again, i know it. my friend leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. you're just not trying.
yeah, i don't feel so well.
and you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! this smells like a set-up to me!  and by the way, ray, i don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film i've shot is in a vault at the lab that only i can access. no one's getting that film!!
who?  where d'you think they come from!
"when i grow up i'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. i always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
don't be silly -- he would not do anything. he is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. he says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
way i see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. what you willing to do for me?
don't do this... please...
stop saying you're sorry. i want information, not regrets.
okay.
yes, but... i thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, i might... stay here with you.
your mother mates out of season.
did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, emily, or to let me use your phone? because we seem to have a slight problem...
can't.  need water.
who?
good. that's standard military packaging for plastique. get a look under it.
no?
they took over a club i was working at.  caesar started managing it.
death first!!
i'm in love with you.
no.  i love you.
raising the shields.
o, let us hence; i stand on sudden haste.
yes.  tell me.
playing.
it seems fine.
... where are you taking me?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
none of this was here before.
i'll take his place, all right?  put the gun to my head.
neither do i.  but my children, they're still young.  do you know who they like even more than jolly old saint nicholas?  his helper, black peter. an old russian fairy tale tells of how santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  that was black peter's job.  he was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  and if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  that was a warning.  if they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. and they would never be seen again.
lookin' at?
yes.
what happened to them?
jim looking for somebody.
there are others.
real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to mr. whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. he was born with what he does best. eat. he's a swimming appetite. 'course he might eat this stuff, but then i've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  next time, ask me.
eighty-two thousand dollars.
blow me.
the man wants speed, let's give it to him. ram it in and break it off. go hard. shag it.
what?
why not? oh, come, papa! what better way could i spend it than on you? my kissable, missable, suddenly visible papa!
you have me, i am here. what more proof do you need?
i can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but bernstein."  i want to send a reporter to miami.
double-exposures? but they're not-- i was in--
i'm not from a newspaper exactly, i -
bids from possible chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
hi... where are my shoes?
mama is keeping score.  frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
you be careful of that little bastard. he's dying to get in your pants, you know.
take a look at this. chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail.
i know exactly what you mean!  hey, honey?
perhaps it was a wrong number...
raymond, raymond, lower your voice! what's got into you?
camelot ...
second.
is he working?
presumed dead.  no one knows.
go back to them first.  then you can decide about lo.
i've lost my car.
you gotta be hard, eddie.
don't worry, duffy, you'll have it back by five.  thanks, duffy. stick around. 
you are forgiven. goodbye.
no, please.
listen, i'm gonna take a steam -- did good last night -- shoulda seen it.
i'm sorry.  you'll do all right without me.  keep my share.
good.  you've got nothing to worry about. soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  and listen, don't talk so loud. take it easy. coast a little.
why?
my mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
he says it's easy.  especially with sad people.  with closed-off people.
if i'm going to die for the cia, i'm going to go out smoking.  besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
well, uh, i - i gotta get the family farm back before i can start thinkin' about that.
well, i wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all i wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
hey.
someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
you're twenty-two, aren't you, ray?
i'd kill ya.
i've seen it.
i know, be still.
sorry, sir.
what is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
get that thing off me, fergus --
i'm on a break.
what are you doing?!  stop that!
oh, for god's sake. really, cynthia, really, i don't think he's your type.
tired?
too late, it's written.
i do, please.
my name's johnny utah!
let me see that.
how do you do?  what did you say?....  he is?.... where is he?  very well.  he's back in town....  wynant.  thank heaven.  he's waiting for me now.  forgive me, mrs. charles...  but i've been so upset.  it's no joke working for a man like that.  i must be off.  goodbye....  goodbye,
what do you mean?!
frankly, i don't remember.
let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  maybe take a look at ripley's place while we're at it.
why not?
your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
who won? how did it end?
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department... and here we are.
there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.
there <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your dad's?
i was just looking at carla's picture.
yes, please.
i'm sure i can make your mother like me. but then do i gotta worry 'bout your father?
yeah.
exactly. two hundred dollars a pop.
no, a major, were you really?
that makes me feel just awful.
oh, yes, yes.
amazing. i'm very impressed.
not particularly.
just one little thing. how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
shit...
'bye, son -- i won't be gone long.
okay. what do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
maybe ya better forget it.
and then?
you know how long i've been begging to take you on the wine tour. i was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
why??  i... i attend every year.
war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.
just smile.
ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
help me!!!
denham! go back to the wall ... tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with ann!
better make it a week.
that's the grace of this world.  nothing's impossible.
and this - if you decide to take the rest.
alright, louise!
yes... yes, let's go in.
my pleasure.
34,000. but they're real short lines. 'just came out that way.
you got a deal...
there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt, see? so dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? so he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! see?
how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going?  to the best of your recollection?
could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>like slo-owly</u>...
i don't know what happened to you, jack ... but i can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
because you're my sister. there's nobody else.  the men who killed daddy are after jake. i gotta talk to him.
beautiful but dangerous.  once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  it's 400 years old.
no--<u>this</u> is weird.
hey.  you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. let me worry about your date.
we don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
-where?
you's better believe it, brother!
if you walk out that door, bain will still come after you.
just relax.
no...  i can just tell.
how's the book?
watch his hand
managers get ten percent.
well, mr. fazeli, the bowling congress says i'm a thorn in their side.
i'm not the police.
i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, dave, but it would be a crying shame, since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and i have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
jack gordon.
you had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
we won.
you didn't hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
black... i understand. what else,sam?
a roma, circa tre settimane fa.
pleasure.  very nice to meet you.
and please don't call her my mother.
not from where i stand.
and you should.  your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
tryin' to save his girl, man. he's in another world.
claim...? ... oh, claim, that's what thomas asked me.
what?
someone wants to play with me?
it's the white house, for crying out loud. you can't just drive up and ring the bell.
i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
bullshit!  i'll go postal in this mothafucka!
okay.
i don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
i would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to cary grant.
what team?
that's what i thought.
oh... "i love you... i can't believe you're doing this... drugs are bad..." whatever. after-school bullshit. the role is brother.
i forgot my glasses.
let's go.
well, uh. she didn't say mr. duke. but since i know you're here with the police convention...
yah.
he said you didn't have one.
someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
my very best to johnnie... bless his soul.
i understand. maybe we'll see each other after the show...
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
you're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
you're livin' in edina, then?
no, i'm just not that hungry.
top level review, my ass. there'll be no cover-up of this. not after i get...
who is knowing? but the drug i have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. by tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. so i think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. okay?
well, no wonder.  we just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and i can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
uh ... yeah, well, you know, ma, john kennedy went by jack.
her mind is set.  she won't change now.
at present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. if my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
i guess not. you'll be heading east from here, huh?
as i said, in every way.  physically and psychologically.  more endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
what?
all the insides are gone!
i got overhead...
doucet killed my partner.
but --
you are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  watch!
grady.
right.  like you were hog-tied or something.
let's get a hot dog.
maybe different.  i don't know, ellen.
i want to tell you what somebody should do.
dad says!
look, i don't think this is a good idea.
yeah, i like it, i'm high up, i can see everything, you know? it's the cadillac of minivans.
she's on the account. there's nothing we can do.
fuck you
we think nlr.  we don't know! alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  he wasn't deep into the crew.
it's just another case, sailor.
sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
come on, let's check the bite radius.
who's next? you? me? bob?
after i graduated college i was all set to go into my father business. umbrella frames -- that's what he made. it was a sensible business, i suppose, but i didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
one chip?
he makes films for mr. eddy.
don't worry. i have a job this morning. i must go to visit my good friend george rutagunda. you know george?
yes.
that's logical. and if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. saves you money, too.  so what's this story you're working on, anyway?
sincere.  what are you talking about, of course i'm sincere with you, mike.
how do i know you'll keep your word?
he was trying to get into my apartment and... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on. i grabbed him and kissed him!
yes. don't worry. everything will be all right.
no rounds for another three hours.
nice day
and bobbie says...
how could i fail to notice that! - i have to go...
that's great.  now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  or, as i always called it --  "stroke the salami!"  ho-ho, jim.  there's nothing to be ashamed of.  hell, i'm fifty-two, and i still enjoy masturbating.  uncle mort masturbates.  we <u>all</u> masturbate.
it's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
i hate this job.
yeah.
i'm jp monroe, you stupid little bitch. now get the fuck out of my life.
-- whatever, and the israelis and the palestinians don't.  art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the israelis and the palestinians are. art garfunkel and marvin gaye --
son-of-a-bitch... my nose... this fuck-up is interfering with-
well, it looks like you're a little late.
yeah?  what about the other five guys?  the five before me?  what about them?
may i offer you a drink?
i'll bite. what's the catch?
oww! my arm, careful!
he wants to see us now.
so, five hours.  plenty of time for a call.  he was 'excited', you say. in the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
sounds great. where do i sign up?
that's the trouble. i am. being shrunk...
miss sloviak's.
we, yes.  yes.  they, they present their side, and i get the same chance.  to cross-examine... to... to...
yeah... sid?
you're telling me your name is frank sullivan, you live in queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 series...live?
i can't.
i worked vice, narcotics... violent crimes... and i saw every known depravity.  i was lost, mace.  in outer darkness.  then i busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. when i met faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  another lost soul.
what?!
oh, yeah? what did he do?
yeah?...
yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
but i am involved!  we're all involved, mom!  a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
a bit.
and we'll digest our food better.
well it worked.
i loved her for how good she made me feel, and i hated her for how good she made me feel. and at that time, i tended to express my feelings non- verbally. i couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
please! you're being foolish!
look, i'm not saying you don't have a daughter. it's just that she's not my daughter.
i'm glad you're here. can you stay for a while?
enrique's gay. i'm sure of it.
allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
oh, him.
no, ben.
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
itís all right, ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
my name?
let him go or i will deliver you, right now. 
i think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
of course it matters!  it throws off everything!  "superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. manhood!  your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. you were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  you tried to turn the cult of good into some after-work softball team!  it's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
you do not want me to do your cover.
well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
...who?
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet.  janet.
well, there it is. writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
cora, in my heart, i know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in england. let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. in view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
sustained. in all fairness, dr. zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
it's hazy...it's got him! stay here and don't let him out.  i'm going to get the doc.
it's barry.
where were you tuesday night?
yes...
yes... but... i didn't...
yeah. says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. and according to my brother nathan's abormally close with his mother.
i'm not quite sure.  try it again.
they burn many villages. even walled cities fall to them.
do you mind if i come too?
good for you.
that's not why you came.
don't make an issue of my womanhood. we are here for work... all of us. let's not waste time. shall we go?
you're out of bullets.
eliminate her.
dorkatops!
i'm tommy.  tommy doyle.  laurie strode -- jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
call off the manhunt looking for me. i didn't kill the transport guards.
restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
we're gonna die!
... idiot! open the damn door! go, go, go, come on!
how could you let her see this?
no... no... i'm just a messenger... he needs me... a higher calling...
no fucking.
fuck you!  <u>you</u> come out here.  hey, toss me that j.d.
we sure need this flamethrower.
we gonna take whatever they got.
dude, get back out there. you gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  hang on girls! just get out there. i'll be right out. you know how i do.
awright.  get into position.  i'm rolling.
my dear rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
this is amber.  her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
he's an undertaker.
your existence.
what i know is what i see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
marylin?
..sorry...
if that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... i mean...  my, i sound a bit --
oh, but i just told you. --
what's there to talk about?  she can sing. that puts her at the head of the class. that makes her the only one in the class.
what seems to be the problem?
they were for the fucking boat, brian.
yeah.
but, keitel, if erik ever finds the horn resounding... if he ever crosses bi-frost, the rainbow bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
this is it?  i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks.  sarah, please don't bounce that here.
because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
honorable discharge. may 1971.
ch...
that's a good little girl.  i knew you'd see reason.
don't they, though?
still makin' jokes?
what? this isn't normal?
[me, too. tell me about the guardians.]
are you sure?
forget ricky. you should be glad max got you driving for me.
not really.
oh i like her a lot.
what caliber is your gun?
i love you, honey.
shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
big truck went right by before you opened the door.  life on the fault line.
pff. all we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
his rug.
that's what i said!
because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
that's not cheating. people say crazy shit during sex. one time, i called this girl "mom."
it looks wonderful. and so do you.
and mine goes with you.
i'll call you.
it is no trickery.
well, i wonder why.
where's snow?  did you call him?
let go of her.
i've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
well, i did.  and you know what i think? i think that it was almost... too perfect.
that one time was just the bumper.
i can't believe i'm really here.  no kidding.  if you're through work now --
well what is it!
yeah.  sorry i barked at you last night.
well, where are all of you off to?
sit down, jake.
we're not certain!
do you realize how paranoid you are?
what are you?
seven hundred each.
over the edge of the world.
i did. down to the cent.$900. always wondered though what mrs. garner got for my brother paul f. must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years. but then they hung my other brother paul a. up on a tree so i guess he wasn't worth the same..i wonder what was baby suggs worth? and halle? i wasn't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti. her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. a breeder.
only six?
i went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in montana. they had a ranch.
but what?
of course, sir.
what is the northcountry development association?
the same thing that always happens! you blew it! and this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  he was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  like you let everybody down, always!  what did you do, take a mudbath?
uh-huh.
anyway, i'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- i won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
i don't.  patrick doesn't.  and his brother and sister don't.  and they're in the house with him.
no -- it isn't.  a cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  i want some answers, nash.
i know we're prepared. i just don't know if... i'm ready.
that's enough, yvonne!
i'll come back if you like, but i'm not promising anything.
ginger's mad, he says things all the time and eddy's good at punching and spitting.
we don't....
i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
i saw budgie gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  said, "what are you doin'?"  he said, "i'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
i came up to dance, wadda you think? you here with somebody?
well i'm not sure why you're calling me.
fine.
all right, i'm not ashamed of it! i split it two ways —
you know what he is talking about here?
but if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
no what?
i don't want to make it. i came here to get you out.
yes.
surgical assassination?! but that means you suspect --
i wasn't asking.
"what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
i guess that's for the best.
okay.
about twenty-five years ago. they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
i'm not kidding.  i want to get out of here - now, ok.
we're only talking about six weeks.
so -- you're behind all this. i should have known.
okay.
pick 'n' save.
no room there. we'll have to set it between us.
yellow pages.  v for veterinarian. there aren't that many.
a man wouldn't do that...
sit down, jack,  i could weep. i really could. sometimes i think i'll retire. just piss off to the bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  glenda, get jack a drink. what is it, jack?
yeah, jesus christ !
i don't mean anything by it.
it's utterly fantastic! this is the sort of thing i'm talking about! we should be learning this!
i tried a little while ago. the phone's dead.
that's the idea.
new hitman wants to leave his mark
you are that and much more. you are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. now we will be together--
i hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
...yeah....well you have me now.
it's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  she's never been less popular.
will you take of f your blouse?
i'm sorry.  it's just ... you know ...
any particular kind?
god, you're beautiful.
frank?
what?
molecular-memory.
yeah, that's tough!  you don't deserve cole porter.  you should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
maybe later.
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
this david's a friend?
there a part in it for you?
i got scared.
okay, give me my belt.
i'm trying to.
a famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. don't i feel special?
this is the official composite of the three precogs?
take some men and get the antenna going. let's see if we can catch the bbc.
you were asleep.
do you know what that is?
who is she?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. i wish there was something i could do for you—
yeah she was a big 'un. you ain't drunk drivin' are you doyle?
yeah.  down there.
where?
and how did she get close enough to disarm you?
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
wanted to give you props on making first team all-american.  and then when magic retired, i tried calling you again.
no, i never.  i would not do that, george.  never.
that's the thing. don't know if it connects, but harold here had a thing about eyes. two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. took polaroids after.
shhhhh.
yeah, i hit a three at the buzzer.
neither do i, i guess.
shhhh! just like your mama, always scared of things...
my brushes, i have to clean my brushes.  thanks, though.
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
didn't realize you were watching the clock.
what people?
yeah, let's just get outta here.
when? how?
not a problem.
what do you hear?
home?  this is your home. you're dead.
i been thinkin about that, too, and i got me a idea.
wagner...
i don't know where. in your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
take it into the living room, would you, hon?
what is it?
you want what?!
sure, just a sec.  excuse me.
maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
i am in a room with lights.
that's right, stud, hold me down.
you are so full of shit
and scary.
huh?
yes, sir.
i know we're early, we're so early. sorry.
i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
i think you have a call?
[do you ever see the hand of god in what you do?]
dr. jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
very good.  now if you will excuse us for a moment.
help me with two minutes of silence!
have a good night.
well, they didn't think too much of 'em in paree.
yeah, she won a fellowship.
already? all these letters?
evan, i am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
i pay you too much.
the king? jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... they put the lug on for nothing at all.
he's saying, "take me to your leader." he wants to know who's in charge.
it makes us human ...
he'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. he always does.
no.  but let's do it, anyway.  it's gonna bug the shit out of harp.
get the grader. go out 29 past toby's. don't let lillian get to you. she didn't belong here. that's why she left.
they belong to the people.
better make it doughnuts, huh?
yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
i wanted to.
don't open that!
what for?  i haven't done anything.
no. what's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
oh, darling!
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog?
coupons.
that's obvious.
yes, mr. brett--right away.
i'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  yes or no, edmund.
that's the name they gave me.
sixteen years ago.
we commend the soul of our brother departed. we love we commit his body to the depths of space.
what are you talkin' about? i said i wouldn't hurt her.
you're a strange man, mr. hutton.
two scotchmen met on the street... and i don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. well, anyway, one's name was mcintosh and the other's was mcgillicuddy. mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "hello, mr. mcgillicuddy," and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "hello, mr. mcintosh," and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "how is mrs. mcgillicuddy?" and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "how is mrs. mcintosh?"...
disco blows dogs for quarters.
no, but we're making excellent time.
i can get them -- but what do i get if i do?
she looks terrible, just awful.
oh, icey, i'm a sight!
take care?  where the hell are you going --
i'm getting a doctor!
from your mouth.
he leave you?
the english??
"i came back. i thought that's what you wanted."
i don't know.  i think so.  i feel very strange.
don't remember.
oh, sorry.
trychticholorate? alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. it's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
you ready?
i told you to send it back.
isn't it ridiculous? coming all the way up here, but you know. they really are the best.
you're insane.
thirteen hundred.
yeah.
you all know me.  i'm one of you, i grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda ...
okay, man, okay.  i'm with you.  i... i heard how the shit's arriving...  it's coming in a lincoln.
ooh, the sister! she is hot.
yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. but... they were still attached to god. agnes has that birth.  no more... we're born, we live, we die. no room for miracles.  oh my dear, how i miss the miracles.
she'll be all right baby.
i'm holding you to that.  gabe, what about frank?
the ones you built?
well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. he's got everything and you've got nothing.
who?
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
i got that.  how was your day?
no, you're not....
i'd be helpless and useless. they don't have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
put your tiny little mind at ease.
there's nothing to hear -- i haven't done anything.  and why haven't i done anything?  because none of you will listen to me!!
listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- i'll do something drastic.
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza.  i got you one of each.  he likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
count on me; that's my specialty.
no.  what do you mean?  have i talked to him about this?
love, you can still write to each other.
it's a great game!  you should play sometime.  i bet you'd be good.  you seem very athletic.  do you have any hobbies?
forget it.
they're ready and waiting.  you'll soon be with old friends.
it was just a visitor. but it's all right now.
with particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
good evening, mrs. lieberman.
i assure you i feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
easy, dignan. it's ok.
she's washing her clothes.
no, i'm not.
sir, this plane carries the president of the united states.
i'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
...how ya feeling, boy?
ah, the witness?
hasta siempre.
and, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  i don't mean to be...
no.
i'm sure you mean something by that, addison, but i don't know what...
- inauguration balls -
i... i can't!
yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. i've made a lot of sacrifices for you, juno. and in a couple years you're going to move out -- and i'm getting weimaraners.
he's always got it bad as long as i'm running in the other direction. don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  he knows how to chase and that's it.  once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  so he runs away.
you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
i think he's weird, but that's me.
just one question. did you calculate the risk?
there's no "we".  there's a me. all i have to do is make it along the north wall to bitker ladder. what you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. and don't put on that mad face.
for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
a manual control on a moving torpedo. this day keeps getting better and better.
tough break.
may be please have the wallet.
nice car.
'love will find out the way'?
maybe now. it was different back then. i had this place, i was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. what do i need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
that goddamn neanderthal? i'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! did you know that?!
naw, i'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
no. she really liked you.
you weren't waiting for me.
that's correct, sir.
greetings.
where are you going, diane?
sir, no, sir.
i'm not breathing right.
so you're saying she moved out.
of course he did, for god's sake.  didn't he, mr. pritchett?
but she's moving away from the door.  who was sitting at this table?
it'll just be a few minutes.
you’re jumping, sweetheart...
it's what i do.
we need to put together a meet for the whole country. we all got the same problems. we could talk. meet the guys we don't know. lift a few with the guys we do.
yeah?
ma'am, i answered your question.  i answered the darn - i'm cooperating here, and i...
yah.
this boy's a troublemaker. he used to tear this place apart.
well -- i've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
huh?
for what?
did you - kill him?
...and put them in your mouth.
what makes you so sure it was one?
what are you talking?!  he's had two months training in those choppers!
just a couple of kooks...
look blair, maybe you're right about this.  but we've got to be rational. we've got to talk this over.  i'm unarmed and i'm coming in.
yeah?
you look beautiful like that.
what grange?
why not?
one day you'll be nice to me.  we might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  at least civil.
you've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
up ahead.
good boy, thank you, billy.
you know that's not possible.
if he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
and who's dave when he's at home?
all right, i suppose you have the right ta know.
breathtaking.
tomorrow morning.
what about michael? do you know the extent of his...
there was an inquiry.  it was his word against mine.  they believed him.  i was fired.
suit yourself.
i get so irritated with daddy. he's so dumb sometimes.
oh, you can come off it with us. you don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
max never had many friends.  so much with the piano.  always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
where has it been for the last seven years?
well, i know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
i'm a businessman, kid.
my father sent luca brasi after them.  he tied the two capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
no, after you.
what wouldn't make him suspicious?
you don't wanna know.
i <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  it was <u>monday</u>.  the day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  and had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
what a guy.
no, it's not.
you ain't giving the orders here!
you wanna know?  well, since you're so goddamn curious, i'll tell ya.  one of you toons killed my brother.
no.
do you take german?
yes, the justice, that's right. but i think you had it in the column.
that must be it. it's a great smell.
okay.
hard to say.  it may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  that's if she exists, of course.
i want you inside me right now.
as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
not her. you!
we'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
we?
if you liked notes from underground, you'll love the idiot.
she's upstairs. she wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
i'll be in the car, okay?
it was a different floor then...
you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
i'll take care of it.
it was okay.
come on, don't me give a hard time. i'm just trying to make the place look nice for katka.
jack kerouback, herman melville, henry miller and hunter s. thompson. i dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. so from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
oh, a *boy*!
don't do it! don't do it!
a couple of weeks back.
daniels.
yes.
i am.
i'll send you a muff.
okay.  you behave yourself.
if he was so good why's he so dead?
do you get to meet ed?
how do you feel?
why george, are you proposing?
erin. i'll always be with you.
your family sent cards.  it was much appreciated.
i had the shot...
assuming we can trust joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? he's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. even if joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... jesus christ! i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. if i was him, i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, sailor. you tell me sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
routine--i'd just call john mitchell over at the justice department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
no!
oh, it's not that. it's just that i'm - harmless.
he's probably a gigolo.
just tell him to call me.
dolores, meet roger rabbit.
anybody want a peanut?
i can't believe it!
you're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
he wouldn't leave her.
you came to tuck me in.  that's quite a switch.  i am looking for my brother, wilfred. he is first butler to the maharajah of mirajanpore.  but mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across india, so wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
please ... we are doctors.
look! they follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
i don't know you and i got nothing to say to you.
harry.
no. it would be convenient, but no.
yeah, yeah -- that's great.
you and me?
maybe i should check lareaux's book. it's in the car.  be right back.  don't go anywhere.
except for me and billy... we were left for dead...
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
it's an inside job. that's a cinch. whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. now brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
oh, i'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
then tell richardson to fire him.
you don't know where you are.  you missed the shipping lanes.
yes.
i know no more of shame than i do of fear.  i wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
ben damon. christine perkins. sarah darling. tom prinze. that's four, last time i learned how to count.
right. now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? give me some form...
i growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
wait a minute!!
not good enough.
mr. weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the fbi. there's lots of footage of you. we know everything.  if you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
yes.
so, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  there's still a chance we'll get back together?
me llama eladio cruz--bienvenido a tejas. [welcome to texas.]
on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
why not? you went farther than that last time.
yeah?
i'm gonna help you.
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
yeah -- fine.  excuse me.  i'll be right back.
it's me...
miguel alvarez. we've lived together for nine years.
but why do you want me?
ha. ha.
yeah, my problem is you're tired.
you're just back from corto maltese.  i saw your combat photos.  quite a departure for you.
you share dreams?  that's incredible.
who?
i don't want robert.
i didn't imagine it.  i know what i saw.  are you sure there are enough men in there?
w... what is it?
there are no twos, max.
hollie was always fond of tide-pools. you know what he used to say about them?
like heroin?
none of the id photos match the enhancement.
the f.b.i. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  i think he's a first- timer.
well, riddle me this, batman. how do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see mallory again?
i wanted you to.
yes, you could. cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. marry me.
then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
you win.
you wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? maybe with the gambling?
where is he?
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
thanks.
you bet. i got a terrific hand.
with pleasure.
who says she does anything for me? she's my friend. when my friends get into trouble, i like to help 'em out.
daddy . . . ?
he's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
out of the mouth of babes.
michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
you know somebody around here?
well, i tried.
what do you read? what's the last book you read?
bull... loney- sir.  i'm sorry.  sir, i'm sorry. sir.  i just, i find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  i mean, everything here comes from you.
i'm sorry it's impossible. it's the truth.
yes.
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
you found him.  i don't know how to thank you.
i've come from jacqueline. she needs money.
she doesn't know -- and she never will.
good. it's supposed to be.
hmm!
i'm blind because my father drank.
nope.
hey?
sure, sure.
are we going to eat soon? i'm starved.
i saw it.
look--i think we ought to skip it.
hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
it was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
shouldn't they be there by now? what's taking them so long?!
you can say that again.
very well.  now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. how do you feel about that?
meet me tratino's at nine.
so good bye, shi'ites.  thanks for playing.  we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
then tell me, what will happen? tell me!
not dirt. see, dirt isn't bad. it's filth. filth is bad. that's what starts maggots and riots...
yes, really! basically, they want what they think they can't have.  same with guys.  that's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
do i have a lot of brothers and sisters?
vecchio.
why, you bully. i believe you would.
hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  i just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
don't worry about it. just go across the street and watch. you'll know when it's safe to go back.
i need to talk to you alone.
worf, what the hell are you doing here?
i hate it when you get like this. this catwoman is becoming an obsession. i say we call it a night. tomorrow is a big day for us...
junior who?
well, i'll have to look someplace else.
bernie.
i'll miss you too, honey --
why'd you invite me here?
what?...oh, no, thx.  that's not true.  not satisfied?  thx, i need you so much.
how is he?
no.  it was mine.  i didn't want any more bloodshed. that's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for nix to come after.
i'm not going to hurt anyone.
nothing wrong with ketchup.
i'm ok, walter, thanks.
then what do you want to stay with me for?
that's great.  let's do a take.
he's over at the boat show. he'll be by later.  it's so beautiful here.
i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's god's gift to women. one twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.
yes.

who...who...
but you have.  you've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow i'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil.
bill.  come on.  the question.  the question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  the question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
have you ever figured they might extradite you?
no sir! but you have to be ready.
lula... i learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show i heard on the radio... how leeches is comin' back into style.
what?  who the hell are they?
tired... and i'm getting tired of being so tired. other than that, i'm doing very well.

i can't go back to jail.  i gotta get out of here.
you are beautiful!
what are you staring at?
huh?  no!  what the fuck are you talking--i'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
you couldn't have made that jump.
do you want me to come with you sid? i mean, remember what randy said?
they can't shoot us in here.
you've got to get me out of here! six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
i'm not your wife.
right.
nothing. two nights later i was robbed. i'm pretty sure they were pros.
exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. you only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
never mind. let's get right to the heart of this thing. twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly wills hotel...
five years ago, my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case.
my mother.
charlotte?! how's tokyo?
you gonna sing me somethin'?
any particular reason?
i can't get it until monday. honest.

where are we going?
oh god, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
uh, hi....
you may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in new york city, but down here we take murder seriously.
no bother. i'm very grateful for a little company. you see, i suffer from insomnia.
the day i show respect to biff tannen will be the day i win a million dollars... what's the matter, biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
no.
he won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
when the bottle in my arse has contracted i'll let you know.
okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got aids, that he'll infect his wife.  and maybe he really does catch something--
you'd be surprised.
just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, jeremiah.
i resign.
the home of eternal damnation, house of hades, h.e. double toothpicks...
who else?
the massive fellow... brom.  for someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
what do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? is that it?
i do! if i can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. if two new hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the indians.
nothing about you.
well, are you satisfied now? can we just lie and talk, huh?
i'll do it.
well, i'm in the emergency air lock and --
yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, i don't care how soused he was. that's like drowning in a teaspoon.
ben. this is business. just work.
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them.
ugh, not pecs. sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
and i am the falcon, winged lord of the sky!
yes, sir?
what do they want?
yes. yes, i will.
because here everything goes backwards. people walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
don't worry.

you should. do you have a resume?
we're here to stay. we don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
nothing can. not ever.
i know that; but who gave the go ahead.
yeah, all right, listen...
stay here. if we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
then how'd i get here?
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, adolf hider.
don't be fresh.
we never really shared one.
sure they do.  the camera can pick this up.
jack.
that much i think we've already established.
you get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
a regular outlaw.
'cause i'm a guy, i have pride.
they believe he's out of state by now. we'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. if he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
what do ya mean?
i remember a bat. a monster. a demon. chasing me.  oh my god, alfred.
just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is.  i am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then i will go home.
megan, take your friends back to the camp.  i'll let you know if i hear anything about your counselors.
do you now, mr. watson?
i will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
all right.  you won't know what to look for at first, scottie. even i, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. she looks so lovely and normal...
it appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
yawing right.
what?
arlight, then.  cheers.
where is she?
taking you for granite?
yes.

thanks so much for planning it, letty. jake's really looking forward to it.
yes.
way out here?
no me mate.
just like that?
a most perceptive choice, madam, if i may say so.  monsieur?
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
like, this way... sort of...
how can that be? he was getting better.
this little thing says i can't.
i got it ta my head now. i got it ta my head now.
come on, don't you screw with her, please!  you... you got to want this: armored car job.  caltrust bank. they took two million in cash...
no, darlin'. just that damnable insomnia in reverse. i sleep like a baby for an hour then i'm wide awake. you go back to sleep.
this has to end.
you never spoke so well of him.
i have it all worked out.
-- ruined my exit!
left? when? i just come from his place and there was no one there. a neighbour of his...
what?
he should be put in jail.
no, i'm gonna drive.
who put my client in the hospital for life.
i'm worried about you.
listen to her? <u>her</u>? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?
well, i have to get a message to her. i have to let her know i'm <u>okay</u>. until i can get out of here...
there were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  i went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
ok guys...have a heart.  this is my business.
yeah, he's a pirate.
so you're gonna take the word of some trick over pop's?  he wouldn't lie.
and then some people you don't like right off. it's funny.  you know why i want you to play ball with me?
i heard what happened.  it looks like somebody murdered him.
but, mr. president...
absolutely duncan i'm on top of everything.
it's beautiful there.  your mother and i were there once, before you were born.
how much time is left?
it is the fortress of krull. i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. they did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. this time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
where's my family?
a room... there is a room, and i sit there alone... always alone...
boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. you just sign these papers and i'll give you ten dollars apiece.
...don't worry about it.  i can punch you in the nose later. right now we've got to get you out of here.  you all right?
am i starting to look norwegian to you, bwana?
nah - i had a shmuck of an uncle named lucas.    grayson.
i'm calling her!
it's the right thing to do.
i'm telling you, they love that shit.
look.  it's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  and maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado.  there are ways of dealing with these things -- i mean, if people are so inclined.
suzie.  then you're not her grandmother...
no.
why do you say things like that?  you're so much better than you know.
don't worry about me, jerkoff.
what?
d.c.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  there's just one problem.

say the words, "i understand."
i'm sorry, your honor.
no, dr. hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  they are science.  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
not at all.
i don't care, dad. i love you.
in a second...  and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
mmmmm.
i heard about your son.  i'm sorry.
he's a big one.
is it now?
i've decided not to open a practice here  i want to set up a research clinic.  for infant genetic disorder.
did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
plus a bonus.
i know i am. why, i even heard a shot up there last night.
...i thought that we were only talking...
no man. pe -- "political education."

he's earned an early retirement.  but enough about losers; buzz fazeli is history. lets talk about your future.  i wanna show you something.

you know what... i'm just little now, but i'll be big soon.
merle? jesus!... patty?
it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. mutated by seventeen percent?
roy! what are you doing here?
i fantasized about you.
and i think that the security of the country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  gemme a federal judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.

he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. his offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th street, and he was using all these words i never heard before. he even offered me a job.
for what purpose?
how come the police never had a record of sanderson before.  this doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
shut up ! it's me.
for him?
yes, sir. 
it's a long walk.

i guess i've got wander in my blood.
hilarious.
-- but i don't believe it to be the truth.
<u>i'm</u> dressed.
funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. i guess... i guess it's kind of pathetic.
i don't know nothing about it.

same one.  i didn't know no impersonator.
don't you think i know that?  but what are you judging by?  bucharest??? this was always a hick town.  they can't get a 'bus and truck' company to come in here.  are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
okay.
one moment, sir.
what? another job? stealing the eiffel tower?
what happens if you don't?
if you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the kronos suit?
one of the other sisters?

lemme talk to him.  will?  shoe?
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum.
arrrghhh! ah jeez... christ...
deputy commissioner palmer strickland.  the sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  i know this guy.  if there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
won't you step into my office, mr. thatcher?
it takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca.
put the gun down, case.
yes.
you don't have to feel any way about it. lecter did it to amuse himself. why not, what can they do? take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  i know it got ugly today. but this is your report, starling - take it as far as you can. on your own time, outside of class. now carry on.
my name's, penny!  but who cares?
synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "i could eat a horse."
i know you knew i'd know.
fine. could you please see that she gets this.

get out of our way.
i just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
i will.
oh yeah. oh that's load off. i thought everybody gone crazy.
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, captain.
he have any special dietary requirements...?
that we could use you in and i think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
oh, okay then. maybe later then.
what good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
i told you -- with my mother.
if they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? help him?
bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
in the hospital. i was kind of excited about it at the time, but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers.
what are you talking about?
honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
machines don't fix themselves.
where are they?
i write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! the whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
...-ed.
because i am the director.  don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.

hullo, sam.  slow day?
huh?
three days? we could kill 'em tomorrow.
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron's love is pure.  purer than say -- joey dorsey's.
no, no ...
i should.  i've been doing it half my life to humans.
easy for you to say, sir.  fucking james ryan, i'd like to wring his fucking neck.
listen to me. the press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. and meantime i'm dealing with the stockholders in new york who are scared shitless -- and i'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. so you have got to trust that i'll do what i can to--
not now, wendy.
i am a doctor. i teach medicine.
you're jp monroe, right?
-- leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard. he came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy. he tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. he started running for the open grass. with the car moving, jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed leo's spine. leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. and some chicken feed. stale chicken feed with four days mold.  electromagnetic printing.

what makes you think i'd go for that bet? that's a seventy thousand dollar car.
no. not everything.
... yeah, that.
flattery! do you think i am ignorant of your stupid little games? preying on you weakness of others. that's your power, a petty evil. mine is great. great plans. impossible dreams. laughable endings...
thanks.  i'll keep it in mind.
we did it, kyle.  we got it.
the down drafts would wipe her out.  it's the only chopper.  if it goes, you got no ride out.

i thought ten years.
it's about time we did! it's about time margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
yes, i am programmed to answer any question.
we wouldn't be having this conversation if i didn't. swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
ooooooops.

you fucker, don't you ever touch lula - you fucker, i'll kill you.

i feel better when you feel better.
no. you have the ring. wrigley has the pre-nup.

i cannot.
it's not a homicide, lieutenant.
look -- i'm sorry -- i've led everybody wrong. i mean yes, i get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  i'm sure this will amuse you; i'm scared of the dark. and sometimes i get shook up, i hear people or -- well, i'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
i'm trying to get susie to stand up to you.  but your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
i wet my pants! my seat's all wet.
maybe you’re not hearing me.  i am jack campbell...  right here.  jack campbell, president...
how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson?
sorry about today, man.
darling, darling... please!
well, we'll see about that... hey, lookie.
let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
please. i swear i won't say noth-
people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boy's town in cuidad leon--
it's very strange. how many people are truly themselves with their love? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. there are no marches against heartache, no ministries against loneliness, no concerts against disappointment. we look away. and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. the one thing we all share but don't say. look john i will show you something.
so we got a plan?
how about the other one?  his friend.
i'll admit i was worried when max called. i had my doubts.
not yet.  called fbi yesterday. thompson's going to try cia this afternoon.  y'never know.
what?
forget about me kat.
that's the bad blood between you and johnny?
really, frank?  when was that?
that's funny, i was just wondering what i was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
i'll be right there.
mummy!
no, kringelein, not tired, -- just --  well -- well --
i just - hate it when they're - finished.
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
saturday night's the 'springtime in paris' dance. i'm taking suzy parker.
memento pink revisions - 9/7/99
i'll do anything in my power to help you restore the republic but i can't be that power.
we also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
mmmmmmm.
yep.
that's nice of you to offer, karen, but i got all the help i can use right now.  instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
well that hardly sounds like you...
jesus, frances, how'd you find me?
yeah.  and it might have even worked too.
what do you mean?
it didn't seem like much of a bump. i'm sure we're okay.
it's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
yeah.  i got some stuff for your cut.
i don't rattle, kid. but just for that i'm gonna beat you flat.
yeah, right, i'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... do you know the cook's chicken franchise?
okay.  but i do understand that your partner, leon jackson's been injured. is that correct?
he followed my birds into their coop. here, you want him?
you scared the shit out of me. i thought you were killing yourself.
what are you talking about? there's no fat on this body.
people make you laugh?
shore it is. it always is, this time a year.
that's right.
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. and make no graven image of the lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. because he's not like anything. not only can't you see him or hear him, you can't even think about him. i mean, what's the difference between that and him not existing?
charmed.
talk has never proved that question, mr. webster!  cup for cup -- what do you say?
i can see no other hope for your planet. if the meeting should fail, then i'm afraid there is no hope.
hell, i don't know.  if i had some input i'd offer it up.
i can handle it.
i don't believe you.
those things can be nasty.
oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
hairy women are kind of sexy. women in their natural state.
no.
it's not so rare. he grew up on our street. he's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
only make bets i can't afford to lose.  only way to be 100% committed.
your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
i'll talk to her, and to dad, too.  a few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
you know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete.  pete.  pete.  it's a nice name.
not quite.
this sophistication ain't tough. all it takes is a credit card.
dr. darling, peter ... all you ...
good-by!
yes, aaron.  i know the names of the cabinet.
look.  i'm happy to entertain you, as always, but i have a question for you.  are we really "friends?"
miss swann, if you'll be so kind?
the new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
it was an accident.   gifford, too.
actually, it all starts tomorrow. it's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from madagascar such.
what happened? jason bourne happened.  you've got the files? then let's cut the crap. it went wrong. conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find bourne, couldn't adjust. it all went sideways. finally there were no options left.
when they're born its like vietnam. it's terrifying.
sarcastic, moi?  maybe i'll mellow when my ship comes in.  it's expected any day now.  i'm all packed and ready to go.
hi dad. hi nora.
but would you stake your life, that's the question...
could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? not about this, but...daniel?
oh.
what?
there's no way i'm taking you to see my mother!
you're skating on thin ice.  my passion thaws for my bride alone.
just do it.
oh, adam.  i don't have gloves.  my nails keep getting longer.  i'll break them.
doing what?
...tonight!
six bodies, sheriff! that's what i have seen between here and ridgemont. a filling station in flames. i'm telling you michael myers is here in this town. he's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
yes, yes, it's just -- you know i've never been the first wife. rex was married before me.
yeah?
you got a better offer?
i was hired, you told me, to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century.  this merger is the vehicle --
i'll check it.
i'm obsolete.  i have nothing to live for.  tonight, i should die.  and you should come with me.
page 32. "deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence." i think you've explained yourself.
let's have a look anyway.
baby, we're money.
i have to ask you that. if you were vice you couldn't deny it. you ought to dress less square. you wouldn't get hassled so much. here, let me help you get that tie off.
when are you gonna be back?
do you always drive like this?
what are you talking about?
all information on 3rd level suspects is classified.
it's automatic.
look, reese, i didn't ask for this honor and i don't want it. any of it.
a thousand dollars!  get out of this office before i throw you out bodily.
they have. but they never found a lab.
no, no, no. we'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
mother too.  sad case it was.  the young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  never even saw her son.
i understand you have suffered. i know... about your woman.
what is it, five days now i don't see you!
knock it off, will you?
and you can only do it once, right?
not till next year.
as you wish...
oh nothing.
she killed herself a week before he died.
and no boys, promise me, oh those la people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and don't make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
my wife...
you're leaving tomorrow?
who's your friend?
you...made that?
mister welles. you're very prompt.
what's it like?
i'm scared...
you've lost your cause
sensitive -- what is that?
tina! tina!! tina!!!
what was your grandfather's name?
huh?
ignore her?
who was it answered the phone?
did sidney tell you about it?
back in the old days, yes.  but now -- no one give two fucks for bela.
i'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. it's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn teldar paper around, what do i need this dink airline for? i'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
hey, i saw that movie. true story, 'bout some killer in texas.
dean fulton...
i've never heard of it.
afraid i'm ruining your reputation, m'sieu laval?
yeah. i suppose i could. but, walter --
oh i know plenty.  i was raised by a single mother.
how you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
i knew she was japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
charged. receiver?
watching tv.
don't be a fool! he's carson dyle!
look on it like a honeymoon.
you'll get blown outta here some day.
i don't care if they wear galoshes!
the marble?
my cousin? my aunt found him. on his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. dick in his mouth. my aunt freaked out. it was a mess.
i'm... i'm doing a very special thing here. and you can't even ... respond?
mimi...
that depends.  where are we?
how?
not yet!
it was a diamond and you swallowed it.
they must've scuttled it. nobody just lets a ship float away.
no more listening!  your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
would you mind?
you're looking for catherine, not me.
garry's missing!
sun city. i've been meaning to call you for months.
but what's the point?  how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
we want brooklyn one hundred percent.  no more taxes to you.  we want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  also we want you to inform michael corleone that we can deal directly with him.
maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
i know who you are, ma'am. how's the eye?
must of happened durin' the night, i don't know... lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. i touched him, just to see, and you believe me, chance - that's doin' more than i get paid to do... then i just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
leave.
how many guys you conned in your life, henry?
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to.
of course.
you heard me, pick 'n' save.
hello, operator? i'm having trouble dialing a number.
who?  the other woman.  your wife.
what's to think about?
wow... stop giving them away.  i got an invitation to model for comme de garcons... you wanna do it with me?
you did.
you don't but it, do you?  she knew nobody would but it.  she knew i'd say she did it.  and she knew nobody would buy it.
insolent -- berlin manners.
dad!!
madison? isn't that kind of... i don't know, gay?
harold!
you're going to be busy all day long, edward.
i'd hold the birds for him, but i'm going away myself. someone's got to feed them, i suppose.
that's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
no.
oh dear.  he wasn't friendly during the filming?
hmmmm. interesting. and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
only now i'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly jerry's to give.
wanna snack...?
you're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
just, i mean, well, you're here every single day.
not too terrific, sir.  i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the earth's caught in a crossfire.
if you'll just let me -
i... no... i don't have the right... i...
it's a gift to my people -- and i see macfarlane and gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
know what i love about dynamite?
are they feeding?
well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... not even for pictures of dolphins...
yeah, i do, but go to work.
just be cool.
you called, doctor?
nothin'!  i told him he was great.
"cora" is my part. you've got to tell lloyd it's for me.
don't bother to call again, okay?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
yeah.  what about him?
... brom bones...
margo, i wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
i was just being honest. you happen to have a nice ass. sorry.
what now what? now nothing.  she passed the polygraph.  that's it.
don't turn. i'm counting the steps to the entrance.
flanking riders?
i'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
no!  you let us handle this.  come along, rool!
that's where your talent lies.
a letter? may i see it?
well it took me longer than i thought it would take. it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. but once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. it hurts the first time.
this is the only library i know of.
i used to, but i stopped.
i am a hunter.  a weapon.  it's what i do.  it's in my blood.
okay, then!
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory.  thanks to marcus aurelius.
illusions are trickery. magicians do it for real.
what'd i say?  what? what? what? what?
i'm taking over a tv network.
go ahead, ray.
for that old possession charge? gimme a break.
it's...gone...!
if she's not there, mother and i are leaving anyhow!
how well do you know chigurh.
what about dr. becker and mr. gries?
huh?
what is it?
maybe you didn't hear me.
i sent them home. go and call them.
luther's on the move...
<i>i'm calling from the kappa epsilon gamma house at california university.</i>
there are maidens as fair, and fairer than guenevere. if i put my mind to it, i could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. offering you their every favor. rich, clever--but if it is to be guenevere, so be it.
hey, jacques...
you came up my river -- in that small boat. so simple. i always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  you are the final justice, aren't you?
composition doesn't pay. you know that.
nothing. why, whaddya hear?
can we get to him?
shu kai kim.
you don't understand you either.
fine!
it was no fucking accident, frank. the little one ...
i'm sorry, deputy dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
--shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
yup.  hey, so i heard you dropped in on tran last night.  another slick lenny move.
very well... umm... i never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? i remember getting to the casino... i remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
you sure?
who said so?
that's what i figured, too.
and wasn't that an oath...?  these are your initials here:  k.c. when you signed this chart you took an oath.  no less important than that which you took today.   isn't that right?   isn't that right...?
oh no... no... you're a romeo.
i understand.  that's very kind of you.
no thanks.
all you are is a professional ass-kisser.
security, ash, i just worked security. they wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
we gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
yeah - go on.
harry.
i'm still having trouble with english.
he was, but he got sick.  we got a new director today.  why?
i just have two more pen pals and then i'm done.
do you really think so?
why?
fine.  one.
-- i wouldn't worry, ms. jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. in the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
is this what you want -- huh?  is it?
the gangster of love don't eat no fried chicken.
when?
i thought you'd chickened out on me.
it is
your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. if you wanted to you could...
know you? are you kiddin'? i've been looking all over town trying to find you. i saw your car piled into that tree down there, and i thought maybe . . . hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
and the stones?  did you find them in the wreckage?
no it's not. it's exactly the same. your father and i met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. just the same as you two.
oooh, i see. didn't go so good last night, huh? that's a shocker. you mean getting drunk and calling victoria didn't put you in the mood? you dumb fuck. your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
you know, i figured out the other day i've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since i've been in the business. i'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. if you want, i can help you look at your options.
it's quite out of the question.
shall we summon the writer? he's in paris i believe.
pushing the legal limit even then.
jacob.  we've got to get to amanda before it's too late.
you don't believe any of this. you don't think you'll ever die.
i don't know...
you can always he thinner. look...better.
don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
goodbye, mr. sampson.
then i'll take it as a compliment.
you want me to front for you.
strike out, eh?
she's in the van.
nice meeting you, too, walt.
how good it felt!
how could that be?  the box was packed!
i didn't know either.
um...soon tonight...i think, yes? tommorrow...i mean...very soon...very...
everyone describes the same process. at first it is exciting.  you're at the centre of the world.  as soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  and there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  your a clerk in a rather dowdy office.  there's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  you're a processor of semi-official news.  some people leave at this stage.  then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  you're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  professionalism.
shut up.
... unless he has a hump.
any women on board?
she's not. she's got her own ideas.
don't know her.
well, i think you're the fucking anti-christ.
very good. my .357. use it and no one can trace it to you. the room will be in some disarray.
ya ignorant guinea, it's kreplach.
and you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
you're out of your mind. we can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
you going to the lighthouse?
honey, i'm not worried about you.  you are going to be a fantastic mom.  not an issue.  i pressed you, remember?  joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
the water's coming in...the water's coming in....
well, your condition's pretty serious.
yes, i'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
i don't have to.  you'll be bustin' in on the chief of police just up the hall. 
c-connection?
randolph!
how'd you get past the guards?
the reason?
no, you're right.  or buddy.  i won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in detroit.  or if you've run into glenn michaels yet.
got here as soon as i could.
yeah, that's why i asked.
you have books?!  kalen, you've got to take me there.  there might be history.  records.  something to help us find where the morlocks took --
i can't do it.  i'll get hit.
i think we're on the right track.
yes, ma'am.
no!  what do you want!!
do you know dr. robert towler...?
i can't tell you.
i see.  dave thank you for your time.  i'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but i'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi.
she poured it for --
don't bother. go to bed and get some sleep. i'll be working late.  i can hear any movement down here.
she goes on location tomorrow.  sally, i'm sorry.  look, i can't keep her on hold.
kathy, i'm about to tell you something i've never told any girl on a first date.  but i think it's important that you know.  i like to wear women's clothes.
go away -- hide yourself.
our exec and science officer...
i don't suppose i could watch.
thanks marv, i'll make it good to you.  you know what my dream is? one day to be on the other end of that phone...
i'd love to. if you're sure it's alright?
what makes sammy run?
thank you.
yes. good was done this .....
nope, there's no way.
no, you gimme your gun, boy!
i'll kill you!! i'll fucking kill you!! i'll do it! i'll do it! i'm not playin' around here!
blessed are the vegetarians.
i think you should leave it the way it was. it was good.
at least i haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
not right now, daddy's asleep.
i opened marlon.  i think it's somebody's taxes.
i'm not here to bowl.
there'll be no vigilante stuff. not while i'm barrack chief.
not very encouraging.
want a drink?
me?
you'll get used to it.  i'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
oh, i do.  but as we know i'm a very poor judge of character.
take it easy, dodge. it's only a piece of metal.
--i'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
yeah.
we'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
this way!
i know everybody says it, but i really mean it.
it's a party.
uh-- in case dwayne wants to try to reach you.
i want to speak to you alone.  i saw something.  i heard.
when she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
that was a joke.
what do you get if you finish?
i've been expecting you; i got a letter from the lawyer.
caviat emptor, mother. let the buyer beware.
i'm blind, not deaf.  wanna come in?
i'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
i have no idea.
mm-hm.
so whoever did this now has our shotgun.
yes, sir.
too impersonal.  they have to meet face-to-face.
ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
what's the matter with you?  so the piano's a little out of tune.  so what?
he's upset, he's sorry.
we won! we won!
say goodbye, mike.
rachel!  they're going after rachel now -- and i can't stop them.
don't you like her?
tick.  not to dash your hopes, but i don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  i'll give you four for it, cause i've gotta cut off the last bit.  and my customers want uncut.
he grins wolfishly.
fine, dennis.  soon as i get my money for this week.
no, i didn't tell him.  and that's something we gotta get straight. darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. when you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  you gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
i packed it. just for us.
she came here. we'll just wait. in the meantime, i need you to shimmy through.
that is why i believe in the future of my country.
you were supposed to show up. maybe i wasn't.
i've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch t.v., whatever. just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. i never need them all anyway.
you got it.
not our problem.
the damn thing's been floating around for god knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. so we take it easy. a little of the old push pull.
pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
where did you learn that?
i know, but i had to because . . .
it surrounds you and radiates from you.  a jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
leave me alone.
babes.
it was freddy.
well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. hard bondage, or course.  other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, i have only two stipulations.
--it's gotta be haldeman--someone from the white house had to be involved--
hell, you know how skinny is. says he's gonna shoot 'em... an i says, "skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "well, then get little bill down here an' let's settle this" an' i says, "bill's sleepin', skinny," an'...
you've got it!
that's right.  three o'clock.  thursday. at your mother's.  you and me.  it's a date.
you got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- we don't know how bad it is -- the guy ripped the phone out -- swat said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. if swat makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. i gotta go in. maybe i can see what's going on in there.
david ... in a free society information is the name of the game. you can't win the game if you're a man short.
where are you?
me, no. you... i-i-you know, if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful. i get too, too wonderful for words. you know, i don't-i don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
the three of you weren't regular patients. you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove.
- torque wrench.
get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
shit, i ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  that does nothin' for me.  no. i don't need to be pattin' no ass. all i'm sayin' is, how do i know you're not a cop?
i was hopin' you would. i know that night by heart. sometimes, honey? i think it's the best night of my life.
goodnight, bones.
you've got something going?
uh, his birthday, uh, may.  i think.
calmer than you are.
just a second.  hello?
george --
do you want to learn or not?
i feel like i need you dad's permission just to kiss you. jody, it's time to assert yourself to be a big girl. an individual. i'm going to this party tonight. jimmy's my ride. come over to my house after school. we'll go together.
stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. there's something you're not telling me, jimmy.
what did you find, dad?
you know dr. maximus, our commissioner for animal affairs?
the kind we've been talking about. can you answer me now?
what happened to you?
i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. didn't you, claudia?
listen, jake. i gotta go.
he wouldn't.
no fear.
as long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  what i've gone through --
no.
naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...a comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...then he eats it.
boy, that mickey spillane, he sure can write.
my spy network has heard no such news.
there is one other thing...
what camera?
it's not your fault.
either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age.
simon, why has he become so... so...
how did you know about that?
make it 35.
and you believed that story.
i'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.
oh, no. plenty of cause. he won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. and he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
you know their workforce.  two-thirds at least fall into the category.  we'll be closing down their operation for days.  at least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
i noticed.
yeah, all right. now, i'll paste this together.
yeah, well we're still a little young for albany state prison. are you pissed about al? i'm pissed too, but i'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
but he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
sit down, jake.
how?
you come in here at least three times a day.  you a retard?  a buck fifty.
fine.
there's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  there's a typhoon in our sector... ...we're going to be delayed twelve hours...
don't needle me, elliot. tell me how bad you feel. we're suppose to feel bad together. this is what friends do.
great.. great. is there any kind of hint or anything ?
oh, she'd love it.
she'd seen him too.
just about anything, walter.
you're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
a shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
i've got something to tell you.
it isn't me!
hear me out...
no, you're not.  but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
no.
why—uh—she's all right, sir.
were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend?
yes. it's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. i hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. i rest and rest and yet i am dying.
you know it brother.
so what are you going to do?
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
ah, good evening, my dear duroc. i'm afraid i've been out hunting and i have had a rather bad fall.
in human life? in greed? in suffering?
i wish i were like you. look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
scamming's a strong word.
don't yell at me, pal.
carvel.
i signed the permit.  i don't know how i can.
you like that?
right?
dignan, i --
what do you think i should get?
no, it's weird, man. nobody knows where he went.
i don't know. that's a good question... but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher. they fired me.
what?
nine meters.  eight.
no...
no. people never run away from anything.  the rain didn't last very long.  you know what i think? i think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. we scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
i don't know.
and a little ice.
they will obey, praetor.
wade. i thought she was alright. till this morning she was.
i find out now.
are you okay, violet?
just for protection.  you won't have to do anything.  i just need you to watch.
hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in rome, and the 727 out of lisbon last year.  major player.				*
i can't get it!  i can't get it unless i move!
how do i know you were gonna show us one?
may i carry your package, grace?
where is this cave he's talking about?
i'm not sure.  we have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
do you want the truth, anya?
gonna cut me open?
thanks.  i thought you'd be older. i expected a red.
what?
detective williams here. is that you, jeffrey?
as in, the vegetable?
well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.
till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. and, after that, i'll decide if you keep your shield.
does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and santos killed her daddy?  does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
i'm no detective. i don't even know how to begin. all i know is i want to do something about all this.
...are you phil...?
right here, sir.
you'll never change -- will you?
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise, and with this i'll help it presently!
he's like the pope. like we're gonna snake a girl away from the pope.
i don't like to talk about that.
daphne -  go on - tell me all about him.
no class...
i don't want to hear anymore about it. i'm not going, and that's final.
easy for you to suppose. while it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
hey josh.
you didn't get any, did you?  you're a homo.
your honor, i'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  mrs. kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
you said you were here all day?
oh, now you have gone too far. there's only one god, victor.
then give me your word you won't.
clear and open on my mark. three... two... one... mark.
what's playing.
no shit? dick, that's great!
in the grub box.  toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
oh well he sure did a beautiful job. pink and gold are my favorite colors.
no.
near the casino.
well, he and mrs. nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
that... is highly unlikely. you're talking about an act of god.
since when did that matter?
"parting is such sweet sorrow…"
why, sure. it's a lotta hooey.
you're very fond of anna, aren't you?
well, then what are you doing here?
i dunno. you know.  i used to really love that alice. do you know that?
if you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
so you thought that maybe i'd grown too attached to this charade i've been playing, is that it?
i swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. i think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from mr. dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
imagine. all this admiration in just one room.
no, no, fax is -
what name?
relax donald, relax.  they're scientists.  they ought to be curious.
i... i was playing with fire.
it'll do just fine.  bye-bye, see you later.
i know.  get out here.
telling you what?
third time around.
yes sir.
well... here.
that's all?
blimey.  what's that?
stop that talk now --
when were the sacred scrolls written?
yes, sir.  his name is vincenzo pentangeli.
thank god.
fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
he had it hidden in the dresser! well, at least it was in there. he took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- his wife's jewelry was in the handbag. and something about it worried him. he was asking somebody advice over the phone.
give -- me -- your -- hand!
- we all want what we can't have?
look over there.  that's the eye in the sky room.
anyhoo, sweetie, i done a bad thing. i kinda sorta wrecked your car...
that's nice.
that's not the way it's done.
but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, charlie?
why didn't you come to me yesterday, mozart? this is a most painful situation. yesterday i could have helped you. today, i can't.
i mean -- you didn't really think that i would do something like that.
i'll work on it...
i've got about five thousand left in cash, but i'll need another thirty, if you approve.
yeah.
i called trina.
you bet.
if i ain't too stove up. i ain't like you. i'm old and give out.  i'm proud of ye.
come in, children.
why?
let 'em take me. it's better that way.
kelly--
and you still believe i'm the one?
now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
okay -- take a seat.  i'll check.
i can't sleep anymore. it's too much like death.
library of congress.
aye, sir.
oh yeah.
i'm too tired for this. let's just go.
hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. it -- it wouldn't be cricket!
counting the gray hairs in your head.
alright, i think i see salvation...
not quite.
that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
but she is not an enigma mother. everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. one, two, three, right down the line.
no, don't. but thanks.
wait a minute! you're not a detective any more. what's going on?
his . . . whatever.
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
so some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
you almost killed me, asshole! if i had any idea what type of guy you were, i never would've agreed to work with you.
oh, no.
okay.  fine.
i've got no stomach for murder.
[beat] i know it doesn't make sense. it doesn't even make sense to me.
sometime, but not like this.
listen, johnny, don't do anything stupid. you couldn't get within a mile of schaeffer right now. so stay put... stay in touch – i'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
brad kovitsky.
you look good.
that don't seem fair.
yeah. i want it.
what about her?
what?
you have no idea.
... you needn't worry about being attractive here.
my parents are dead.  don't even think of bringing them into this.
i got a lot on my mind, aunt rita.
great.  sit down.  oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
uh... halloween. you know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. what's yours?
i like having the car, the car is important.
hi... am i late?
he asks when he can come to visit you.  he left his address.
that's very kind of you, mr. bialystock, but i ...
how do you do. i'm mrs. chasen. come in.
well, i've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now i'm trying to write a novel.
okay.
this isn't an animal, vince.  i've been on this case four months, remember?  i've learned a few things.
it's hard to say. doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. all it was was appendix.
that's the girl i love.
yes, sir, commander.  this is mercury one.  everything seems a- okay up here and ready for count-down.
then break it! if you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
it's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv.
what thing?
okay.
hi, mark.
a mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  that's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
why?
no, it doesn't... just kiss me.
i'm not your source on that.
my life is over.  go.
of this...superman.
why?
to his own daughter?
psychology major?
which one you talkin' about now, son?  we know ole hazel did it; we know young roxy did it -- and the other one well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
but what if...
is this really the time ?
it hurts too much to care.
no. no...
don't worry, sugar. it ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
i have no memory.
oh thank god, i thought i was the only one.
something he said, just before...
no, i haven't.
no, i did not.
no, i ain't got you...
you're too young. you should be in school.
i don't like to interfere.
goddamnit, they are out there, david --
no.
if the weather holds it might not be so bad.
you're color blind.
what?
i'll keep it in my office room.
rip my face off? hey, we all make mistakes. hell, i didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. but i did, and now i'm paying the price.
well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
why are you bothering me about this? can't you leave it be?
you shouldn't watch such things, doll.
of course.
i thought we already had this out? next year, if your grades are high enough--
i would totally love to go there. but i hear it's really hard to get in.
first of all, we're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens. we'll watch her for awhile. i'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
hey austin powers, it's me, mick jagger.
know what?
the milkmaid's daughter?
you think that <u>is</u> the truth.
no, sir! it was the hardest thing i ever did, sir! until this.
fuck all that.
ooh-kay...
that's perfectly clear.
look, carol, maybe walter's done you a big favor. you always said you wanted to get out of town. go for it. and be happy, goddamnit, i'm rooting for you.
he's a good soldier, jude.
i figure.
i do fine, adam.  how 'bout yourself?  you doin' any good?
he's jewish? manzetti?
you've got a hormone deficiency.
get your reserve bottle and let's go.
the workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
i like the way you talk.
well, no.  i think...i guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  i mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as i do.
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to?
primed to go off right over his head, officer.
aw, honey you know i can't do that.
yes.
it's all yours.
you're lying.
i take no account of gossip, your highness.
they'll be up there in a half hour.
for christ's sake, booth, i just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  you got my word on it --i'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
a scratch?  your arm's off.
yes.  yeah, i-i'm kill--
whatever it is you're upset about.
lecter said a lot of things.
it'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
what?  what was that?  something funny, miss swann? share, please.
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washington's cabinet.
check ncic, maybe he's got a record.  then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
okay. i'll take two guys off.
we just thought that—
don't trouble yourself about it, homer--this ain't your business.
we don't want a child called 'junior,' ain't that so, clark? why sure it is.
at the point -- i don't -- look you'd be on tv maybe one or two times each. i'11 try to avoid i'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. believe me.
....hi.....
i call this the staccato. 
edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
wait'll you see it.
i don't let myself think about it, even-  - but i do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose i had to go on one night? to an audience that came to see margo channing. no, i couldn't possibly...
...it's my problem, too.
what's he holding?
i hope so.
it's over, finished and done with.
lady, i'm here to help you. this man is very dangerous. an armed criminal.  he's got a gun, hasn't he?
so... pretend it's not a game.
not eating like you used to, that's what.
confused.  i'm not sure what to do now.  i'm not sure what he wants for me.
hey!  i was in shape before we started doing this.
hello.
shh! he's back there. i can see his hair bobbing up and down.
you were pretty bad, huh?
blackheart?
thank you, but it's an appointment. i really shouldn't miss it.
how do you know what kind of sex they had?
right.
jesus, seymour.
well!
for me? -- oh, please, something sweet and cold.
take a look at these.
can we get some coffee...?
good news, bud, the mayflowers have moved up the time-table. you're hitting the vatican to-night.
it's not too bad.  it's a tragedy! why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
yes, a ticket to chicago.
well, wait a minute. you married him.
what do you mean?
ya, that rack holds six ties.
yes, and now i'm reading war &amp; peace for fun.
oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
yes.  later.
can we make it?
this job... do it if it's what you really want.
-- yes.
what line of work are you in now?
come on.
i'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
i’ve got all the time in the world...
how's kayleigh doing? she all right?
i filmed this the morning they left.
i was just wondering.
ya catch any fish?
and i still say you stand up and i'll stand up with you.
aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. anyroad, i'd better get back.
you don't know the deetzes very well, do you?  my father bought this place.  he never walks away from equity.  why don't <u>you</u> leave?
how did you find out?
but you're irish!
i've never dealt in black-jacks. never.  everybody knows that.
doesn't matter. i always finish second.
that's not my fault.
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
how can you say that?  what kind of monster are you?
um, i guess --
are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
so what?!  i've got two of him!  and this many dimaggios and robinsons. i was holding these out, too.
yes. look, let's get something straight dewey, i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me. not cause i'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings.
same rules for everyone, sir.
the princess louisa is too ill to move.  frankly, the queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  you're smiling.
luke needs help.  we must go back.
yeah. doctor malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. says it's helping to bring her out.
i didn't say that - i'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
i don't know.
i want you to come back with me to salzburg, my son.
i could have grown up happy. a yankee fan. a divorce lawyer.
tails.  that's ridiculous.
they're not really, though, are they? i know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  i can't take them, i know they'd just sit around staring at me, and i'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  that sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  i like sting and you hate him.  but the rest of this stuff...  who the hell is nick lowe?  or gram parsons?  or the boredoms?  i don't know these people.  i...
to hell with procedure!  we paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
what's going on ?
your rig?
and i got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
nothing.  i just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  i had no idea how i'd missed it.
my name is chance.
i'll drink to that.
whew.
i like that.  that's a solution.
he'll not flee if i show myself?
abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. and when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead...
i'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
yeah?
yeah?...
there was.
raise the glass and push the blue button.
j.j. gittes. and it's not a departmental matter.
have you read all these books, will?
miracles do happen.
the way i run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
if i think of myself it's because you never think of me. never. never. never...
yeah, i saw 'em. poor guys.
if i hadn't killed beynon., you would have.
how would you like to be yourself for the day?
bingo.  not quite what you were expecting, right?  i got to say i love seeing you non-believers. always a pip.  almost done.  smell good, don't they?
guess not.
they're moving pretty fast.
it died for your sins.
we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out. so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased.  all right?
are you mad????
how far does this train go?
i know.  but you have a full day of school tomorrow --  you, too.
oh, but the nurse, she went away. i think she must go to look for you.
"no"?  "no" to which part??
where --
so in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the statie. so my uncle's like, "is there a problem?" and the statie's like "i pulled you over and you took off." and my uncle's like "i never seen you before in my life, i been home all night with my kids." and statie's like "let me get in your garage!" so he's like "all right, fine." he takes around the garage and opens the door --and the statie's cruiser is in my uncle's garage.
he's a liar! he has no such thing! it's my own fault. i should have had it patented first. he's a crook, damnit.
speak for yourself, boss i don't have a hollandaise sauce
isn't there anything i can say that'll change your mind?  you're gonna stay with your new friends?
is he here? are you with dickie?
i wish that was all miss weathers, but there's more. the killer left a note.
it's nothing to do with me.  i wasn't even with him.
stop sounding so fucking sad! jesus!
i'd like that.
nah... how much money have you got?
hospital.
hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
no!
our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
yes, i will. it's what you want, isn't it? huh?
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  and jumping in...
what book?
you really are a beautiful woman.
was there visual contact?
just what he told your detective.
come on, get in the truck.
yes. you?
flashlight.
no. probably stay at a motel tonight.
i know... but sometimes i get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
honey. what were you doing with that?
do what?
move the candle closer, i can't see.
well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, i thought, if you were willing we might move you to grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. see we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
i'm waiting!
that was eight years ago. some people change, you know.
are you open?
we'll get you whatever you want.  get that other kid. we might need him.
i'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
yeh, she's...i'll get you ben first, it's past his bedti...
up on the coast. about sixty miles north of here.
what?
don't want to. i love you.
really?  huh.  he told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
because you are a man. and you were right -- i have always known about man. from the evidence, i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. his emotions must rule his brain. he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
jerry, this is what intimacy is!
is it so unrealistic to think ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? as an apology? and i don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
rudy levine the shmuck?
you're kidding. are these the answers?!
but, i've already put her on the search and detain list.
awwww, buddy --
no, i'm not afraid. why? you wanna meet her?
no!

window.
i saw...
yeah, i don't know how you could make that confusion.
no way, man.
the things that get you excited.
and that is?
jon!  get back!  you don't understand.
for the very first time in my life.  do you know what that's like?
now... you go home.
we will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
yes.  i do not know, either.  what do you want, george?
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
i only meant...
yah, linda's fine. you should call her.
nothing's going on.  maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  he's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
yes, sir.
but, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. you come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
i'm mike.
dinosaur eats man.  woman inherits the earth.
michael fitzsimmons! is he here?
what do you think you're doing? go on, get out of here.
that's some long green.
why not?
you gotta go, r.l.. i ain't foolin' this time.
no, no.
oh, i'll represent alright.
yes.
come on.  i saw you on the net.  why do you think i accepted this date? you're a sure thing!
joey...it's okay...
i have little time for your mercenary concerns, but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  what is your price?
excuse me.
as above, so below.
yes.
well, let's see... i guess i'd have to put traditional jazz, blues, and ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
no shit, sherlock. i can't believe it. i just killed my best friend.
they're dead now.  we can get help.
he was the bank on that shipment outta mexico three years ago.
i've been on ice like this when i was a kid, skating.  spread your weight, keep moving.  go on.
now you're an accomplice in a homicide. everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
for control of the prison drug trade?
would you mind terribly?
not particularly.
no, please.
jesus christ! what's that smell?
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas. you?
look.  can i pay you properly?  you don't have to tell him what you got. send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  give it to charity.  or something.
just go! go! dammit punch go!
you're always your harshest critic.
just wondering.
nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  hang on gentlemen.
he tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
well, what d'you know?!
were you badly hurt? i think we saw each other at the hospital.  i don't want the car. in fact, i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
give me a chance --
or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. you haven't seen any of that, have you, diz?
who?
...let me just show you.
i know. i came up with it.  you look nauseous.
don't remember that being my fault. seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
hey, i'm fine.  whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant international neighbors...?
he's your fiancé.
oh -- yes.
grant? grant, i'm hungry. i'm so fuckin' hungry i think i'm gonna die.
good night.
bag him.
i'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
it's peggy to these eyes.  same nose, same hair.  plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
oh.
no?
wow, you get a whole room in your own house? she's got you on a long leash there, mark.
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
what, as a sales rep?
worse. much worse.  a teacher.
oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
jerry?
not a very good one i'm afraid.
from whence did it come?  our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  of armed and violent dissidents...
can you tell me about it?
no.
what happens if you level with her?
i have a seat. i've had it since nine.
don't listen to 'em, don't quit. remember - kennedy, bobby, and king were against the war.  where are they now?  don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  president johnson bombed laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  how the hell the times ever got ahold of this ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
this is my brother-in-law, karl matuschka.
come on.
[how much do you want?]
no, odette says he's in shock.
no, i haven't.  i suppose all the waxworks are coming?
no, thanks.
oh, that's the beauty of it. these are free samples.
it's good you found it.
soo -- pah doo -- per.
yeah, me too.
really?  you told your father what you told me?  you let him see your passion for acting?
like what?
yeah, i always wanted to watch you eat.
-- "oh, no, officer, i'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- what? what do you mean he's dead? it's all my fault, i may as well have killed him myself!"
that's it.
it's a bet. you're the witness, emmi.
of course. of course she was married. what else would she be? single? i don't think so.
i fell in love.
what is it?
what am i supposed to do?
the ear is from a missing person maybe?
i don't know. i don't know what happened mother, i woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but i don't know what happened.  i don't know what i did wrong, i don't know and i should be punished.
then he will kill you. that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there... an' like me. it ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  look here, let me show you somethin'.  see this here pistol?
oh, listen...
the guy we're doing? he's disappeared from the map. i can't find him anywhere.
i don't have much choice, do i? it's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
i know.  lenny, if tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
where did you plant the c-4?!
you might hold this for me.
no.
i am not a frightened girl.
you're woogie?
hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
i'll give it my best shot.
yes!  with a herring!  with a herring!  cut down with a herring!
no. no you're not.
how do you want it?  the eggs.
she's not a tart.
look over there. two women fucking a polar bear.
you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
we haven't seen each other since high school.
pull over.
well, officer, don't worry ab...
sure.
are you screwy?
wha--? yes, sweetheart-- wha--?
yes sir.
i don't want them to love me.
because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
i'm going to throw up.
i put reynolds in the cab myself. the night cost me a hundred scoots and i got bupkis.
except it’s scotch.
well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. that's what i want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- yes, that's what i want. i can pay now if you like.
yeah. yeah, not bad. how's your's?
wake up?  saturday is the lone day i get to sleep late.
even if we get out of town and go to another airport i'm sure the fbi and chicago p.d. has alerted customs.
i must say you can certainly tell mr. sampson's been gone a month.
huh?
fine, thank you.  here, please take these.
sorry.
listen to me.  i don't want sex.  just give me the address and then you go.
captain... i'd like to go along...
excuse me, professor lambeau?
who cares? where's that diamond!
dolores?
that's gonna be tough because dixie mccoy's dead. the a.i. flatlined him.
laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
max... what are you talking about?
i'm sorry. i shouldn't have asked you.
well enough.  you're looking "happy," nelson.
you don't still think it was me?
why surely, mr. president, there must be some mistake.  i mean...
i got it.
anyway, what i was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
i think hemingway wrote somewhere... i can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  i think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
strange, that i have not. i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, lord vader.
i should go back.  ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor...
are you saying i should be frightened? is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck?
he made you give him a blow job.
so, mr. marsh used cocaine?
what do you want me to do, chief?
oh. sure, i -- did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
fuck you! 
local lawyer for dominican dealers.  off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf.
we have no choice.
i'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
that was lovely.
there are times when you don't answer the phone.
oh shit, thelma!!  shit!  shit! shit!
i liked it.  he's not afraid to be human.
please.
is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
francesca, listen to me. you think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? what we feel for each other? how much we feel? we're not even two separate people anymore. some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? that staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
i don't know <u>anything</u>.
i still don't understand --
and i keep my mouth shut?
i'm telling you!
calm down.  why would they keep playing after you paid?
oh god...
that's where we came out.
and when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
no i don't.
sid worley, i think you're ashamed of me.
agnes, what happened to the baby?
where?
no doubt you would, baron. but do you know, i'm quite indispensable to her. i'm her ballet master and her nurse. i hardly belong to myself anymore. but, there you are, it's grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
sure, snake. no problem.  you gonna kill me?
for a butt-head? yes.
this is your room, malcolm. i know you'll keep it clean.
this is our last chance to play "what if". i want to do it. i'm just scared of getting caught.
and if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
oh... um, william.
i'm always serious.
sor-ry  we have to do something. he can't wake up half done.
tell me. what do the police say?
you ought to put up a banner-- "frontera, texas: gateway to cut- rate pussy"--
... a mrs. doneghy called ... i told you that.
and i saw that i was alone.
only he ain't quite finished yet. blondie -- get that smudge pot. tie it to steve's leg.
yeah... thanks.
i'm still here, doc.
i thought that was darwin, sir. or perhaps nietzsche ?
he wasn't acting?
i'm not tired.
it's mom.
when they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
was he funny-looking apart from that?
mr. hypnos, you run this place. i'm begging you. there's gotta be something i can do.
why not?
you've broken its leg!
the planet has been totally blown away!  it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i've ever seen... if the empire had a new weapon that could do this... i would have heard something... i'd know about it.
that wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
forget it. i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you...
sorry, michael.  no hard feelings, huh?  here.  try these noodles.
that's simple. she was pregnant with me...when she went to russia and she didn't know...and then when the russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
another episode of 'daddy knows best' at the strode house.

oh, i don't know.  i guess it's just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be.  you know, like in the movies.

they've gotten worse since i took away her credit cards.
of course!  we must do it!  it's the will of god!  what is it?
arbogast said...
it's a souvenir from the 1964 world's fair at flushing meadow.  it's my lucky coin.
great!  how's it going?
he always just picked it up at my place. but with a.t.f. involved, i want to stage it. you know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. then it's up to ray nicolet, the a.t.f. guy to follow the shopping bag.
i know what you mean.
hello, bobo. how are you tonight?
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed.  you realize how rarely they make that ruling?
she's wondering what's happening.  we're losing air faster than i thought.
oh yes we have... are you alone, mr. gittes?
wait a minute?  what do you mean "worked"?  everything is still off!
i did find him!

but you charge. i mean, you sell tickets?

oh gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. never better!!
oh yeah, that's a possibility.
hear, hear...

bless me, father, for i have sinned. it's been two months since my last confession.
how long have you been watching me?
right!
well, mister hendershot, if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, i guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
i saw her.  she looked just like this --
i don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?

i don't blame you for getting angry. you are in a frustrating situation. you must be patient though.  trust me completely.  i'm here to help.
lursa and b'etor? this doesn't make any sense. a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps geordi and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades. why? what the hell's going on?
honey.
well...
did you try?
who said i was going to die?

i was pretty confident that i was going to blow it with talia, but i must say, i outdid myself.
almost five.
i'm going to see what else i can find out about mr. fred krueger
no tom, just listen.  all my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  i've kept you out of things, tom, because i've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny; i know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  what i am saying is that now, for how long i do not know, you will be the don. if what i think has happened is true; i will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  i give you complete power: over neri... fredo, everyone.  i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
"life can be beautiful." hey, i know where it was.

i wish.  you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission.
because nothing else matters. that's the great thing about love. every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and i know that i'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. cause you're my baby and i love you.
yes i was... he said his last words to me.
he still likes you
florida license plate.
yes.
yeah, i know--man made me memorize the whole damn army chain of command before he'd marry me. so this is a big deal, commander and  all?
i run the place. what can i get you?
i had you covered.  from back there.
checkin' it out
everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? do i look like chicken george to you?

don't answer the phone. it's all right. it's all right. nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
no, where is it?
don't tell rowan about this.
really? what would it take?
sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  all you do is take this two grand across the street to shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  there's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  we only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
figure it out?  figure what out?!
i called mommy.
where are you gonna go?
freedom... we're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
trust me. this is bigger than tony pee-pants.
oh, right...
on second thought, would you let me have it? i'll get the tickets.
don't be afraid!
i can't!
they don't know shit barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
the only faster way up is the east face and it's smooth as glass.  maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
uh-huh.  well, i still jerk off manually.
if it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
not to mention on me.
me, too. parts of the bible are great.
i'm all right.
there is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
hello lloyd.
begin main sequence. mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
i don't really want to talk about it, bob.
i'm just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'. van patten  rehab's done wonders for you, pal. working for unicef now?
but that's cheating!
why sir?
that's right!
sure. it's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
wasn't that cowardice?
we check every four days.
it's an american boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
you mean, you couldn't? or you wouldn't?
okay.
just some buddies.
i told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
about six years. my partner took me.
let me think. i need time to think.
we're ready when you are.
through a rental agency.
i dream about it.
but they have to be diplomatic.
they were auditioning for the same role as you?
the man's the same, even if the name isn't.
commander.
- none taken -
french fries and ketchup.
where are you going?
i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long.  they all knew you at that place.
open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. if you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
the manager's door is metal.
can't!  can't!  can't!
is that him? is that him?
that's not who i admire -- i admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
maybe he's got it right. maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
it is for me.
- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were.
willy -- hit the lights.
what about mrs. moebius and...?
i suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. i'll have to arrest you of course.
nobody's seen anything like this. lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
like that merchant-ivory clap-trap. all those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
could you be a little more specific?
yes. the pressures you feel, and again, i am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. so stop the tom foolery -- the shenanigan's, will.
sure. but i took out a whole grocery store.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  it gets so you don't mind it.  that's the worst thing that i can confess.  you know how long it took me to get there? a long time.  when you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  you think you're queer...? i'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  you think that you're a thief?  so what?  you get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  get shut of it.  shut it out.  you cheated on your wife...?  you did it, live with it.  you fuck little girls, so be it. there's an absolute morality?  may be.  and then what?  if you think there is, then be that thing.  bad people go to hell?  i don't think so.  if you think that, act that way.  a hell exists on earth?  yes. i won't live in it.  that's me. you ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
oh, i think you already have.
how shall i do it?
on account he got caught in the doctor draft. he was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the eagles signed him.
... nothing.
yes, yes i know. victor, whatever i do, will you believe that i, that --
he was a damn fool. selfish and ambitious. very much in need of seasoning.
how bad off is he?
a mister... seymour butts.
betty it's me. it's me.
why would i care where you're going.
was gonna be tomorrow morning. now, who knows?
at my meetin's i used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. then, i'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. i'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. next time, do it again. i figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
busy.  i went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  a big vehicle.
what kind of cancer?
yah.
we can do it!
...sales promotion, "you lose, then we fire your..." no.  it's medieval... it's wrong. "or we're going to fire your ass." it's wrong.
thank you, ma'am.
i bet that's exactly what she tells herself! but you and i both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. say, how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work? i was thinking maybe the king and i --
honesty is always best.
good luck then.
-- go blind.  i know.
like an elephant.
i can't... forget the baby. okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells. you'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
i never heard of him. name somebody else.
and that's different than this because...... ?
include me out.  i've had enough of the conversations.
why did you quit?
aye.
yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. check with the wife.
no, what did it say?
now, squire, you're not going to let me down. we still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
make sure it's elevated...
who knows?  it worked.
i have to come back.  if i don't come back the people will think i'm a coward.  tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- i want his blood on the sand.  do you understand?
amen.
don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
i should say not! that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
you're a real mate. and what about tommy? have you been to see him yet?
did you think i didn't kn-kn-know that?
what does it mean... climb down to the horseman's soulless place?
oh, no! it's not for you. you're only going to get married. mrs. dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon.
you have a boyfriend?  of course you do.
my cheering section.
do you usually pay for charlie? at "trattoria <u>valentino</u>"?
you haven't gotten very far, have you? that's where you were an hour ago. come on, let's knock off and go down to joe's. the gang's waiting for us.
yeah.
mmmm, possibly. yes. but public opinion has a way of changing and you, alex, if i may call you, alex?
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
he was watching you.
belong - to you? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
i wanna go home.
not without claudia. where is she?
no, she didn't claire.  but i think you should do the scene.
how ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
but not now.
why, because you're my security consultant?  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
yes.  a prepared statement.
i know i don't have to. it's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. o.k.?
...ditioning.
but not you.
eli. why can't you remember their names?
really?
he's out of the equation.  talk to me.
it's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt.
doctor peel, i presume?
uh, import-export. olive oil. right on 7 1/2 actually.  in the vacant office. so we'll still be seeing each other.
why?  am i making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
it's not my place.
i do not know him, but i have seen him.
he thought he could take my place. it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i don't think he's man enough to do that.
glad to have you, david.  how's the new office?
better get that story in, hank, it's getting late.
what do we do here, david?
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. if you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
um, five.
no, edmund.  he's a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time.
god, i'm telling you, they're out!
since seventh grade.
elena.
no plants.
it's just the way things are, kiddo.
i can accept that.
it's a carlton fisk baseball card.
happy now?
all right. that's what i want. poolroom with a little handbook on the side. getting old.
who?
she kissed me.
where are you?
'cause that's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty. they think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. ya get no respect... i gotta use a bad word -- whore. you'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
ray, come an--
nothing.
it's time for me to leave it behind.
i think i can work it out on my own.
don't know.  nothing i can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
course not, compadre. you'll see me again.
clear!
would you have free candy for the kids, preacher?
boy scouting.
the man has friends. and they're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him.
grayson - anne's lawyer.
i've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
no. no. i heard from superintendent zimmer this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our special needs class, he's bringing richard moffit himself to the thanksgiving day parade- check in hand.
will you come soon?
your lady friend.  the one who gave you her business card.  think she was just being polite?
dumb riddles, merlin. i am your king.
uh, yes i am.  and you are?
three years.  sister.
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
oh, hi...
i didn't guess until it was too late.
magruder does.
what wouldja say if i toldja i ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
cortex bonding....possible temporary.  before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
no, i'm serious.
rob, i mean it. i want you to be my first. me and you. once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
why?
i was pushing as fast as i could.
no.
seventeen months ago i was posting a walk in lisbon, and he was there. he never saw me. but i saw him, though.
he did?
well. i like a man who gets to the point.
big dave--
i hope you're not comparing yourself to napoleon. he was a strategist. your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible hag. she's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--and now she's built a hut in the back..why did you...
okay.  it was funny.  but it cost me money.
ooohhhh!
how did you get into the business?
i guess.
she's not like mom. she's... i don't know... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.
i'm not a gladiator.  i refuse to fight.
incredible.  we should take a drive before they're gone.  spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
i... i don't know what your name is.
what?
uh...where...where do you want to go?
he was not family. family is all that matters. do you think if you or i were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
i'm just too old for going steady, josh.
nothing.  i don't know.  everything was normal.  no changes at all.
i just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
oh, no. we have dull stretches every week or so, thank god, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
who is this? what's going on?
yes.  and congratulations to all of you. it was superb.
she's the scream queen.
well, what do you wanna talk about!
no, i mean...
no.
hello, daddy.
what for?
bones... can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
lou.
of what?
thanks for the presents.
i hate that mickey mouse bastard.  i hated his father, and i hate sonny, too. always with the tan.
what do you think?  maybe i could reach the ledge without falling. no, forget it.
yeah. this is the best thing i can do for my life right now.
from glades to the turnpike.  then i left with glenn.
but sergeant...
there you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
we have volunteered to rendezvous with the klingon ship that's bringing chancellor gorkon here, and escort him safely through federation space.
i just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  my name's tom grunick.
look sheila... i'm sorry...
i'm fine, daddy. when are you coming home?
difficult to explain everything now...  and much larger issues loom.  i'm sorry about carruthers... damndest thing to have to die for.
headed there now. the same shift will be on at noon.
try the black knable.
good night, josephine.
and switched keys.
twelve years younger.
haven't you already done a bit of that?
i agree.  but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
heard you got remarried! congratulations. didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
what are you doing back?!!
this is a legitimate cinematic genre. just like westerns, comedies, film noire, science fiction...
the sand.
i stole four beers from my dad.
no problem with me on the job.
i hope i made myself clear. you may call him "the duke," "my lord," or "sire." and there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "noble born."
that's all?  that's enough!  she was a beautiful little girl.
but, paulie, please.
see my breasts? see?
leslie i'm sorry - i - i didn't know what to think
mm-hm.
wait up --  -- just wait up --
it was on the tv.
but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous --
someone's got to do it.
you're applying for my internship, aren't you?
i thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
thanks, i'll be fine.
why?
well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
sir elliot.
wish he was mine.  that handsome boy over there, the one with the wavy hair.
come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
thanks.  tomorrow morning, i'm on a bus.  i'm gone.
there's been some trouble downtown.
partially, yes. but doctor, that's an active case, i'm not involved. if -
yes, charming.
yes.
i am the desert, where water disappears--
if he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
ah, captain?
are you saying this is illegal?
you have a better suggestion?
aw, you'll be okay. less than a mile.
then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. i don't want him twisting my arm off.
that what's happening to you, only faster?
must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. how long you been in it?
no, she wants to be there.  and there's mrs. kalinsky.
he can learn.  he is learning.
probably an asteroid field ....
focus on the present. you always want to change the past. let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
you know that chick?
was it a nice funeral?
no shit?
i don't even know if it is my book. the bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  it's mine now. i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. i'm dying for rain - of course i'm dying anyway - but i long to feel rain on my face.
right.
oh.  well, i guess some like it hot.  but personally, i prefer classical music.
i can't work this.
we could give it a try. i'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
i'm hungry.
i'm here.
what reputation?  you're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
what happened to kurtzweil?
israel's legal representation, the firm of culpepper, brody and reed, which is currently the subject of a joint sec and treasury department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. rupert reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of jack dupree to pick him up and return him to las vegas... that can't happen.  we have a gulf stream standing by at reagan international to transport you two to lake tahoe.  it's very simple gentlemen. valacchi, fratiano, gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of the la cosa nostra, than buddy israel.
what are you going to do?
go!
what signs?
natasha! natasha feastavich!- but we called her nashie fooshie!
uh huh. well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, i'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. and furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book i wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the pen award which, by the way, i accepted 'under the influence.'
oh nothing.
our minds?
indeed, sir, sometimes i'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
is everything ok?
i don't understand. what's happened here?
and is it true, miss moritz, that you love victor frankenstein? that your heart was broken?  answer the question. do you love victor frankenstein?
bobby, we're launching. see these submersibles here, going in the water? take a message.
baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  how many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
hi, everyone.  i don t think we've met. i'm sam coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam.
--still go see the ob in the morning--
not my imports.
you don't believe me, see for yourself.
so you just decided to return it to the sender.  or, in this case, the sender's wife.
no, in person.  now.
you said hello. to frank. you wanted to talk to someone?. don?. and little donny. you said something about momma loves you. and something about a meadow lane. something in an hour. i don't remember any more.
i'm sorry.  what are you doing up here?
where's pop?
they are singing for me.
what do you want me to see?
is it because of the hookers, sir?  you tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
may 11th.
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for williams' capture.
why don't you get us some food. this may take some time.
who?
uh-huh.
i didn't.
sorry. look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. excuse me. then you ask me to lie to the police.
the official apology from the justice department, the vip treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
handle what?
i know. it's so upsetting. i'm his number-one fan...i've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. i'm so proud of my paul sheldon collection...  ...here i am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. i haven't invited you in. please.
yeah, me too, okay, cool.
can it be that you want your brother found?
no, sir -- i'm a real chef, sir -- i'm a sauciere --
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
one.
send a dcpd blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  what's our confirmed time?
joking? no, ma'am. oh no! i mean business!
whatever you two want. if you've got the time, i've got the wazoo.
you ... you ... i'd expect it of an anglo, yes ... but you ...
for the last time, i have no idea what you're talking about --
i was in the neighborhood.
i know, paul.
i ain't stupid.
something about tampering. some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the r&d budget into his checking account, i don't know. why are you so interested?
regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. it's video, dude.  now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
what is?
... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.
i can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. that's when the girl found him.  something smells like shoe polish.
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
well, i don't know.  no, i don't know, daddy, i think the rain has obscured it.
wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
chet?  to a play? are you kidding?
strickland.
i don't like this... i don't like this at all...
it's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
whah?
in a minute...
some of the brown stuff is still there.
why?
i don't know.  something wes had taught me.  i think it means "don't shoot. we're your friends."
maybe i already have.
that's also my business.
i'm...all right.
please.  when i came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. but something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  the whole thing is new to me. very new. i've got a confession to make to you.  baron, you are a crook.  you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  may i have the salt?
-- you told me.
sure!  i'll even let you drive.
not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
yeah.
i'm real touched.  now get your sunday's on.  we're going for a ride.
i didn't know about the puppets. it's a lot to take in, all at once.
what kind of a shark did you say it was?
gotcha.
there's one more person here for me to visit.
there must be-- but when i'm with you i can't find it.
what?
nicky, i'm sorry.
cost what?
'nellie's nymphos!'
the government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. but they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
maybe they are!
what responsibility? you're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. just a shoulder to cry on deal. one thing leads to another and before i know it --
oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>toon</u>town.
all the time.
that's no problem. we have those in stock.
next time. tonight, i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine.
yeah.  you have the wrong number. there's no one named frank here.
are you married?
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. that's what usually happens.
you were the last one i saw just before the accident. do you remember? we made love.
yesterday.  i gave her a thousand dollars.
we'll lower a basket from the window ...
look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
would you have believed me?
a little bit.
and the guy sent you a bill for this?
mr. d'amour?
it tells me what every face tells me. everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  what is it you want?
nervous?
how do we decode it?
what is it exactly i don't understand, agent mackelway?
you turned renard.
yes, joe.
to be deaf?
i'll get back to the log. but on the bridge, i won't go back, back in there...
my god, these people mean to go to war!  they really mean it.
every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
why am i mr. pink?
i ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
wait.  wait.
i don't need anything from you.  i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain, naked, and, it hit me -- nickie's birthday.  so, here i am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. not necessarily in that order.
left behind...?  this about rowan...?
but it's not true.
it's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
the fork is the least of your worries, claude.
he's completely innocent.
well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
who's she?
why don't you shut up, professor? just relax.
you've been on your feet for days. and didn't even finish your salad.
what's that on your forehead, pal?
his peritoneum has ruptured...
the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  if you want the ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
then just wait.  i'm counting this all out and deducting my share. while i'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  and her little girl.
what?
yeh, go ahead.
about goddamn time.
i mean in show business.
the driveway's on my side of the house.
yes. i did.
i don't know, jim...
couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
yes.
trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
yes. it's the same as usual. nothing remarkable about it at all.
not so fast. he barely knows him --
but i'm a married man. i got a couple of kids. i can't get mixed up with—
but, when you fall asleep, i do things without you...
you mustn't talk russian to me.
what makes them think that?
never mind.  not for you to worry.
why?
you mean, like to throw 'em off?
give in? that's our luke out there.
you mean there's something you haven't asked me?
yes, sir. like you to meet opal.
it's not charlie. it's me.
i'm not gonna sit here and debate. i will say this though: what shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
and i worked there. for a year.
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory.  they will hear that you are living in luxury. he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. and soon the army won't even remember your name.
almost immediately.
c'mon. what're ya tryin' to be? the phantom lady?
did it yesterday.  franks and beans.
praetor shinzon. we’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
their fourth!
if paulie finds out, we got problems.
spells? jesus, james, you make it sound like we're in a tennessee williams play. i don't have spells.
lots of people were.  lindbergh had just landed in paris.  come on in.
oh....sure.
easy enough for you.
c'mon, baby, i painted them for you. they're beautiful now.
yeah, i get it.  time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, harp?
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, i need some exercise for chrissake...
don't be sorry, neither does dad. wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
it happened too fast.  he was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! he was out - and gone.  we...we fanned out...stanton must have let his guard down!
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers.
yah, but i - okay, i would, i'd guarantee ya your money back.
i thought it had a lot of merit.
you're a bastard.
you and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
i wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, lynda.
no offense, kent. you're good, but lois is the best we've got.
<u>whoah</u>!  oh, honey, that's terrific!
leave him!
you! you're lucky i didn't fire you. i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
have you been out in those streets?  do you know what those kids are up against? you should help them!
he knew what he was doing.  nobody forced him to rob banks.
will you listen to this man? will you just listen to him?  you really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, god knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  that could ruin us.
in the name of elric, prince of elves, demon begone.
what happened? somebody step on your hands?
well, let me know when you do. until then.
you mean babies with you?
i know, your wickedness.
it's been months. it's not like him.
have you known him long?
we passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. the palazzo gioia. they don't even know i'm in rome and i'm not going to incriminate dickie --
no, seriously - i know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  what do you think it is, dad?  jen says it's a moustache, i say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
no.
fine! fuck it! when we're done she can i.d. me. i don't care. just tryin' to be professional, but no...
right now, i'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
sorry, can you give us a moment?
mom, mom, we need to be more constructive here. i don't see this as a gender-related issue.  she's still tense.  we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  right?
awww. that was so cute.
hey, if i'm late, think what her husband's saying!
this is important!
now, now, don't fret.
don't you see? jason was _asleep_. and he was dreaming -- the rem patterns prove that. and i saw finger blades just like krueger's come out of jason's chest. there has to be a connection.
i'd really like it if you would come round some time - then i could cook you a meal - what do you say...
do you need some money? some extra clothes?
no, i'm not gonna letcha. you have a great voice.
and they have the video. that's confirmed.
not today.   where are your friends?
sure, they'd turn him down. he ought to know that. i'm going in there and talk to him.
more than you know.
oh, yes, please.
i call all you white guys "jack."
what i'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
you would do that, your majesty?
what are you doing?
what?
he might have hurt somebody.
i doubt it. she's just an...
no, i do.  i feel like clarence thomas.  i'm like... harrassing you... right now.
jim, the enterprise is twenty years old. we think her day is over...
you ok out there?
i'm here.
i don't want a mistrial.
poor father . . .
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr. viznick.
whaaaatt?
i'm glad.
oh, darling. i'm so relieved. let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me?
you bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  and for what, kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
the rest is barker's bank records. it's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in mexican cashier's checks--
no.
don?. where is he?
sure, lenny.  the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
we talked him into it.
i can't talk about it. the work i was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. i don't know... it could have been beneficial.  mostly, i got paid a lot. i took the money. my wife was happy. my kids had good medical. good schools. got a great house.  i mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may as well pay my rent.
no. if anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
yes.
they haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
yes.
all right - i'm mad. i've seen a ghost...
no.
i haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
and down here --
a ring.  i wanted a ring.
end my career?
oh, all right. come here, grandad.
what!?  what are you talking about?  why should i help you?
sure you don't need one?
why were lefferts' eyes black?
a man has my family.  gold watch here. dark tan.
maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
give me the god damn mirror!
buzz me the minute she comes in.
what time is it?
sure! i was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls i know.
right on. you know what? he doesn't need the limo, man.
dave, i find your story simply not believable.
pictures.  they're always in my tote.  i left my tote in the damn trailer.  but! he's mac all over again.  imagine mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  the fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
what are you going to do?
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.
who is this?
banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
you said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
look -- you may be a big yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as i say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. now get down here!
yes.
i am alone in the world.
havana.
protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
what?
you'll see soon enough, hon.
you're drunk, boy. i'm not gonna bet ya any more.
if you wish.  you're not wearing any underwear.
early! stop!!
came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  told you you would.
"a beautiful geek? what're the chances?"
yeah. scary stuff.
yeah, i remember.... kill any jews yet?
leave him, he's dead.
i don't believe it.  do you?
yeah -- we met him.  wonderful boy... close personal friend of george's here.
you? you kiddin'?  if the gestapo would take away your bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
h-h-hearts.
bullets?  no bullets!  oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
where's my damn ammo?  nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
no.
fine.
yaaaaaaaa !
good luck.
by the bunks.
you could say that.
tell me.
sera... please go.
they can really take over, that's for sure.
i must offer to the duke.  i will give you his answer tomorrow.
it's time you did some talkin', dr. mum -- wait a minute. that is your name, isn't it?
good lord, what do we do?
thank you.
excellent.  we accept mastercard and american express.
do you happen to have a picture of alan and his wife?
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans, but i think they did it -- tex, gideon and scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. i'm trying to prove it. they think i'm working with them. but i'm not, and that's the truth. i'm on your side, reggie -- please believe that.
i'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
dr. david ravell.
i understand that. i just thought that you might want to know.
uh... you're under arrest.
that the universe will unfold as it should.
what about captain amazing?
he's right, williamson.
diane court does not realise how good-looking she is.
yeah, don't come by here any more. if i need you again i know which rock to turn over.
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria?
no call to. that jail looked pretty solid to me.  how's she feel?
all you've got is one life. i guess it's worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that's your whole future. that's as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
you will have to ask mr de moraes that, sir.  would you like a drink while you wait?
which is?
let me tell you something. martin swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
think we should call the local p.d. out there first?
go for it, man.
it's three.
different tables.
it's pulling me deeper!
esdras is a jew.
i couldn't say.  but even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
national?
sean!
yeah right.  i got an idea for something new.  how 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
yes.
thanks.
oh, yeah.  scared the hell out of skipper.
"wee willie winkie runs though the street."  we think he might be making a reference to himself.
english! english, you stupid little retard! we america now, tina!
he has no cynicism or anger. for once i'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
why? come on, leonard, we talked about this. it's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
we lost him.
be sure they got enough water.
you're welcome.
taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
oh, it's all my damn business now, lamar.  investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  he's my suspect.
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
i'm completely serious.  there is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  you know what that is?
is the veronica lake look-alike one of your whores?
gimme that.  pick it up later.
i got bored in saigon.
good night, mother.
i hope you realize, bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
anything's better than mark.
steven!
look, i can start up with him again if you really...
and you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
sometimes is still hurts. you know how it is, man. i mean, each day you think about it less and less. and then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. it's kinda weird. you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. and the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
i didn't --
she part of the training?
the payoff.
ms. laufer gave me a star today.
what's the matter, paden? you afraid i couldn't get those two behind me?
sure, rocky, bob's good for it...
sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  a nebbish like you!
if it was my own mother, i'd carry on! you know i would. for the paper!
that's right, steve.
because you like to remember her. i want to see you enjoy yourself.
this is my wedding.
yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
if we could take a look, mr. wigand...
sorry i got you in trouble.  but listen, you can share my rations.
she's not very nice, is she?
they ran.  as fast as they could. caught a train.
what!  say, listen you!  when you get back to new york, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
did you?
he amputated his own leg?
that’s quick.
as in...?
what do you mean 'why'?
pressures on, eh proximo?  there's got to be a load of money in this. why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
wait... wait... just "brother". so i go in. "hello... hi... we loved your guest spot on baywatch... blah blah blah..." whatever. so, i start to read, and, mikey, i was money. i prepared for a week. it's a starring role. i'm crying... the casting director, she starts crying...
why, certainly. i wanted to get a peek at his face...
never mind your theories. was she ever conscious?
you don't need proof when you got instinct. i ignored it before, but not no more.
oh. what happens now?
good.
i can't believe it. this is too good to be true.
the creatures?  they attacked you?  they tried to possess you?
who else knows?
d.c.
not at all -- a great privilege, doctor.
her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  pull yourselves together.
twenty-five percent.
right.
listen, i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there.
awful?  no.  it's just lonely. it's the loneliest time.
i know it! please believe me, i know that...
holcomb? i didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
of course, you could return with us. our society might find a place for you and your mate.
fortunately, not.  this is my first experience with it as a physician. but i have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call zombies.  i am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
christoph had spinal cancer.  his body kept rejecting gene therapy. he was desperate.  it was him, it wasn't us --
[lucky how?]
it's over, jake. it's all over.
pity.  murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  just look at amityville.  he was one of my boys.  didn't have to give that one any lessons. from day one... but i must be off ... i've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
that's only part of it. i mean, it's a big, big, big part. but it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
i am a footnote in that story. i am the context for your great adventure. which never happened! incidentally! you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born.
roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
so far they're keeping their part of it.
having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
tonight?
and people make their choice--
three months.
sleep good.
you won't believe it! guess!
all right, look--
milo? shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
god--what a big league move.
of course not, my dear! i didn't come here with any such suspicion. how ridiculous!  nor did i come here to pick up his hat.
and what it that?
i sure hope so.
it's a symbol.  of your desire to return to reality. --inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
i imagine so.
talk louder. i can't hear you.
you can't, convict!  you're just a shmoe!  every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?"  it's a natural inclination.  but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! you are on my planet!  you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!
you'd better talk, schulz, because i'm going to find out with you or without you. because i won't let go for a second. because they'll have to kill me to stop me. so talk!
yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. don't fall through the ceiling. ok? is he listening to me?
and what'd she want?
i find his work overwrought.
because i think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
it's grandmother style.
how'd you find me?
no! you hate me.  look, i'm gonna do it one time.  that's it.
run a week?  are you kidding?  this play has got to close in the first act.
this can't be settled any other way now...i'll take full blame.
yes.  in about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with dreiberg.
oh--a wonderful thing--yes. get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
i can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. i don't usually go so close to the surface, but i was...
what troubles you?
it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins, lotta outs.  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  i'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  it's just--
where are you?
i like you, dil
sounds perfect? what do i owe you?
he didn't tell me anything. all he said was saint severin...
pretty as a picture.
dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life.
i don't know.
but the sith lords are involved! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  they're probably looking for him... i'm no match for the sith. this is a jedi's work.  this is your responsibility!
go on.
well we can definitely call the police. that's an easy call. if we call the police...what happens?  they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...they ask us...what happened? we say, ah...our friend, micheal...  your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
i hate when you say that.
for ellie's birthday, yes. i didn't go because her old man thinks i'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. jud, what's this about?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
never eat before the show.
oh that makes a lot of sense. why would i rat myself out?
you owe the don a service.  in one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  be there to greet him.  if you have any objections speak now, and i'll inform him.
while you two were dating in high school. we're talking four, five years ago, back when i drove a trans- am.
why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
i read you sir.
i'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. if i'm right, mrs. peel is innocent and you have a mole.
i didn't say nothin', boss.
i don't know how he does it.
no, you take the right.
what have i been doing all this time? do you know how many mines i've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  and now this.
why, i'm surprised, mr. burns. that's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
you think this is just about politics?
your a nurse?
i don't know what i've done.
chicken.  this is a great short cut.
really?
me too.
a benedictine.
yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
you think so?
we have to keep moving.
morning.
are you suggesting i call him master???
okay.  sorry.  don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
mrs. robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
not dis pain.  dis pain tru an' tru. make it go 'way.
what are you talking about? i'm freezing.
that i gotta see.
there was a man named colonel wilson, from the air force base.  he was talking in our class.  he said we could visit him any time we wanted.  i'll bet he could do something.
i don't want a mistrial.
you know that's bullshit.
well, i'm contracting the land.
me, neither. i don't eat meat.
sylvia plath.
good luck, tracy.
but i couldn't go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things i've done.
stop pressuring me...
as long as he gets out ok.
everybody but joey, and you know who.
i can't remember.
you tell theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
yes, we are.
i'll meet you there.
who put the big hurt on...
this is a tv show, not a music video.
now? what about the boss? he's not gonna like it.
i don't think so.
i was acting as a private citizen.  nothing that i've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe i am connected with.  or in whose <u>employ</u>...
i'm lovin' it.  you know how i know? because i'm getting a boner, my johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
no. she's frightened. she doesn't know where she is.
what did you do?
he said what?
then, take blood parasites.  it's yours.  now we each have three.
what?!  how do i do that?
i didn't say when i want to die -
we're talking thermonuclear explosion.
you see that bird at the faro table?  that's johnny tyler.  he barged in here one day, said he was takin' over the game, started slappin' customer, wavin' his gun around, scarin' off all the high-class play.  only trade comes in here now's just bummers and drovers, just the dregs.
yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. she's an amateur, just like del was.
and you believe that?
they shut all right now. and the blankets are ready.
oh, you don't get off that easy.
it's so exciting. new york. the mad forward thrust of everything. my sense of time here is completely altered.
long trip.  pretty nice of you to come.
it's ridiculous! i'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
conrad, what a surprise.  gesundheit.
'at's-a fine.
so...what are you, blind, son? this is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  there's no winning and losing here.
well, it's kind of weird.
i think that's the whole point.
who's the married man?
no, holly -- wait! he's running. tell them the rest!
look, if you're going to be like that... you should be appreciative that i'm interested.
why not? don't you love artie?
hilarious.
"fuck the machine"? "fuck the machine"?  what is this.  courtesy class...?  you're fucked, rick--are you fucking nuts?  you're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  you want to...
no...
micheal get a grip.  what did you tell her?
try and be inconspicuous, okay? act like a fan.
nothing.
i told halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
in the dark, lad?  why should he do that?
huh?
yes i do.
not tonight. honest.
well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
no thanks. i'm looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts.
did you find her?
that is correct.  nothing.
maybe if we gave the tapes back --
shut up.
yes, dad.
i really think you're -
i am sorry, jim.  i suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
well, you're probably right. i guess that's all that hubris is.
what's the goal, joel?  my goal, joel, is to just let it flow through me? do you know what i mean? it's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we're all taught we should be consistent. y'know? you love someone -- that's it. forever. you choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. it's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. and my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. you know?
can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to drake bishop... owner of the stratosphere hotel & casino?
don't
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
well, it's not good enough.  just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, kit? guy like you.
i thought so, too.
quite simple. yes. good.
you're the president. come in! your brother was just telling me a few jokes i can use on the radio--
i understand your concern, but i feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  look at yourself.
nice doing business with you, george.
ben.  this is business.  just work.
but what about your research -- ?
leaving what?
not at all, if it can help.
hope you’re ready, sid. we got one last surprise for you.
yes!
got it.
we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos.
god, you ask a lot of questions.
thiavolos, as we used to say in greece. the devil.  pure thirst.  nothing more. he was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  like you.  unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
yeah probably.
terrible.
what do you want?
i don't have the problems that artists have.
what do you make of this?
an austrian... not much to go on, is it?
i'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. keep both feet on the floor. we'll be moving ninety and over.
we'll cut him in on the bets we make. and still have enough profit to send ho-jon to college.
during the farpoint mission. we were on the bridge and you told a joke. that was the punchline.
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
unfortunate that i know the truth?
hello, my friend.  he doesn't look french to me, vincent.
you've already been that. c'mon.
i'm going to get the real murderer. i've got an idea.  want to see me take him?
let's dance together -- belle.
and nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
but there must be a reason. this is science, not art.
yeah, it is.
i was staying in character.  "egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
he's here!... he's here!
which part? that or the day-to-day.
and almost got hanged in peacetime.
sorry about interrupting...
but that's so fuckin' stupid.  i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.
good example! good example of what i'd like to know? he didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
who was this partner of his?
on the repeater.
how quickly?
this'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
i don't know.
then do that, starling. do just exactly that.
oh, yeah? how good?
pictures! jesus!
could you take a look at mrs. porter?
look. i don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. for all i know it's pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart. but if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, i admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. what can i say? it's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. but to be pursued by ... demons no less ... there are no guides, jacob.  you wanna know what i'd do if i sud- denly started seeing demons? i'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. i'm no saint.
no! no! gosh. see, there you are! i'm not making sense!
cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
you're a reed, man.  i gotta get anna.  hang in there...
what time is it?
like treacle.
lion, darling -- i knew you'd come!
fuck you.
yeah ... betty. you don't rush it. i don't rush it. we play it close, just like in the movies.
i guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
what about you? what are you doing? something strange, i bet.
hey, look. ice cream.
the press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  and what light through yonder window breaks? `tis the east. and you are...
i know the feeling...
oh yeah?  you're a smart man?...
108 and still active?
right... christ i'm tired.  do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
i beg your pardon?
yes--thanks. i'm louis creed.
no, why?
how long... how long i been out?
jesus, you never told them?
sloan is all 'dat.  i try her.  i'm a tri-sexual.
big?
we'll be all right...  we will...
i'll go in right now and get that eye.
oh?
it's not a lie! nickels and dimes! to stuff into their own pockets! you can read all about it in the newspapers there!
look at this credenza.  if you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  it's got to cost a fortune.
don't be a smart ass.
start pulling it apart!  we're climbing down on it.
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. for what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player?
i've told you ten times--if i had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose i'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! sure--he was cooked the night i sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
viktor, you should have said something.
the doctor harry used to go to. he was passing just after it happened.
it's the most beautiful place in the universe.
you watch your back hammer. hanukkah might just be his first move. for all we know kwanzaa could be next. there's a lot of brothers counting on you. if you fail...
well, i think you're cute.
sounds quite beautiful.
why must you fight... everything that is normal? you are blessed with such beauty. life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
sure, sheriff.
manning says i'm too soft on you --  the candy. give him the candy.
sam! no!
me, too.
nay.  it was lost.  when i came up for air the pond was frozen over.
not until recently.
why—
how much are your rooms?
ain't that the sweetest thing. what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
do you think he was telling the truth?
i know, but i mean -- not fooling around physically?... or not fooling around intellectually?
okay, come on down.
what was edmunds doing outside?
you just had a good example of it. a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
it was perfect.
you need not kill a man to destroy him.
yeah, i can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
i'm totally freakin' dude. i keep having these nightmares, then i wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. i can't take it anymore, man.
fine. sorry i brought it up.
vi a rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[i saw rosaria taken away by the current--]
on speakers.
c'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
thanks for your time.
we'll go back tonight.  bring the children.
nudie booth. you've never been in a nudie booth?
hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
no, it wasn't, was it? you didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
yes -- how about dorothy?
i want to go home...
anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. i've felt it myself.
short range scan, mr. chekov... on screen, mr. sulu.
it's all right.
well, i was in be- it's three o'clock in the morning. you, uh, you got me outta bed, i ran over here, i couldn't get a taxi cab. you said it was an emergency, and i didn't ge- i ran up the stairs. hell - i was a lot more attractive when the evening began. look, uh, tell- whatta you- are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? is that possible?
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
tell me a story, john.
i don't understand.
don't go over it again, please.
supernumerary. it means better than expected.
wilmont. near the high school.
i think i'm starting to wear her down.  have some anyway.
this whole operation was a molehunt.
but it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
i can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, i'm going to give it my best shot.  let's go to work, boys.
if it's not him, there's no deal.
of course it does. if we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
he threatened to kill me.
i don't mind telling you i'd rather have you working with us than against us.
no one's gonna make that gent. six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
you wanted to share this moment with me.
i don't know yet.
listen--
how can i be sure.
i just want to be alone.
you should knock.
don't "come on, dignan" me.
no, mr. ansel.  i wouldn't sue you.
why, certainly he can.  matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
well, i've failed at everything else i've done and i can't hack it as a journalist, even for the bugler.
what are you bitching about now?
who?
you know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
that's not a burn.
what do you expect me to do about it?
a reaction to azt...
we better, congress invented him.
i'm happy enough.
goodnight.
your bank, mr. kringelein.
yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
don't bring that up. you're the one who wanted us here.
i've been on the job.
that's none of your business.
what are you talking about?  it’s me, jack campbell.  penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper!
you're going to have to give me a little more than that, jimmy.
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
i'm taking you to the hospital.
oh my god jennifer. i should go to confession.
then, what's gone wrong?  why did it happen?
shucks, i dunno. but maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
jesus.
anyway, we kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? a body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
she was there, wasn't she?
you see, we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
yeah, yeah i know. okay.
yeah, but if i told her about the other stuff about frank...
what are you going to use for money?!
i remember you from christmas eve.  you have a thing for helping women, don't you, officer white?
will you shut up... just give me a drink.
i'm mary's sister.
quietly.
am i in charge of this thing?  or not.
so pee? here?
jerry!  you can't be serious!
that's good.
jeanne, listen to me very carefully. we are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  we do so in the name of our holy mother church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  so now... will you please recite our lord's prayer?
well, i don't think i've seen you since the reception at dean ackerman's last year.
you carryin' a firearm, son?  don't lie to me now.
come along, dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  hmm!
am i?  or, are you and young masbath dead along with me?
nothing to tell.
where's the plow?
hey, father? you like movies?
give me some narco skinny.  i want to put out an all hop-head issue. shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  maybe tie it into the rosenbergs.  you like?
and the nuts always call themselves great.
hey, man...
oh, he's fine! i just heard from him. he's bombing all these places...
let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we'll see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
you think you're better 'n me? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. so i gave him to you. on trust, in the name of science! and now i want him back.
what do you mean?
you think that's wise?
let's watch some tv.
how can you die if you're already dead?
yeah, rock particles.  dust.
how'd you find me?  what's happening?
jane, there was an envelope in my desk. the one i’d given you and then got back, remember? i can’t find it. do you know where it is?
very thoughtful. don't touch it.
talk. lovers murmuring to each other...
let's talk in the hall.
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? you don't think that was a dream, do you?
he remarried. apparently they were having an affair for years. apparently the first mrs. delaney was a bit of a stiff.
under the mattress. i hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. he wants to marry me, he loves me. i can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
what's daddy doing?
i am preparing for a ball!
no, he doesn't.
relax.
did anybody follow you?  see you come here?
-- zero isn't interested in your life story.  who gets killed?
who are you?
well now, launcelot, galahad, and i wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the french by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
but let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
and if it doesn't? by cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all.
trudy and i are goin' for gina...
didn't i tell you?  i'm always right, you know, my dear... aren't i?
well? why aren't you there right now?
daddy, no!
very simple. just bring him to... that place we been using. mac, you take care of the details. call gerry g. in if you think you need him.
you're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
all new people start with that...
how do you know that?
convene?
we did. fifteen minutes. you totally never showed up.
a few thousand scattered about the globe. in the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. that won't be necessary after tonight.
i'm looking for trade
mmmm-hmm. where's the, uh, 'dragon's lair?' where do you live?
opera?
let me come and talk to you.
okay.  it's good knowing this.
what's he like?
thanks, man.  i've been hating myself for the last two days.
i could do it. remember the day you wanted the pencil? i know why. and i saw that car again. i wrote the license number in my notebook. except i missed the last number.
you heard me. where is it?
someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone. i've been there. i've seen it.
those two we brought back with us. the girl and the kid.  i don't trust 'em.  i say we terminate 'em while we can.
i was here, hosting a party.  who was killed and why do you think i can help?
yeah.
no, ma'am, i'm not.
you won't do that.
are you saying they won't help us?
is dr. frock safe!
yeah. i'll check.
and i *love* her! there ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as i do!  i wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, homer--you must know that.
no. open her ...
it couldn't be.
mm.
... what?
go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. i don't feel like talking to you.
alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? i mean, your life is new york city. you're just this person. you're like this island unto yourself.
melvin, go get karl and take him down to the old classroom.
five-- six--
do what?
no, thank you.
i have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; and but thou love me, let them find me here.
that's it. pankot palace.
that's more food than these people eat in a week.  they're starving, too...
oh, yeah, sure. you know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. when i was seventeen, i don't know if you know this, but i was crowned mount rose's american teen princess. and this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, rebecca ann leeman is competin'.
pull the cash.
c'mere, doctor.
i did not think so.
very good, joe. now, belinda, i've got a figure over here, of one million, five. i...
so what? it's nothing to be ashamed of. you have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
you are young. you don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
i'm somewhere, thinking of you.  and meatballs.  and you know what?
well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... you really want to hear about this?
that's right.
well, i show a 95% probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula...
how old are you?
egypt!
i apologize, sir, i'm having a bad day...
that girl was amanda krueger.  her child --
i fell in some mud.  now hurry up!
dead at forty-one.
there too...
anyone else?
and how's yurek?
i have had them since childhood.  i cannot remember what from.
so?
then i think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
i'll send your toys there and i'm sure you'll get some new ones.
oh, let it ring.
and they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
i called my dad.
but it doesn't eat what it kills.
that's your friend anthony?
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  nice guy.  good looking.
i can't let you in.
let's get hitched.  i guess i, you know, love you.  it's a beautiful thing.
ike, you could make a song outta that!
more lies.
what makes you think you can?
--i'm woodward.
you almost knocked me down.  the word is "excuse me."
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
hey, i ain't cryin'... i still fight. kinda do it like a hobby. see i'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
it brings out my eyes...
i guess i would've felt sorry for the universe.
i don't know what i take you for anything...
oh.  oh.  oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  no.  swell. 'cause i don't have to...
i hope i helped you out.
have they harmed you?
i don't know.
i've got to feed my cat.  besides, i want to get to bed early.
he's in the bathroom.
<u>you</u> made it a problem when you let owens die like that. when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
-- viktor, that was short subject.
i don't drink coffee...
ooooohhhh!!  of course! the father! forgive me!!  can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  everything has been so awful!!
no, i'm -- rescuing you.
mr. scott, we need everything you've got now.
you just said he could eat anything.
fucking great.  i invested some money in them.
you? no.
how would you kill him?
i was expecting you. you are american too, of course.
well. since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
i don't know... let me sleep on it and figure it out.  because i'm stuck! can't go back to what i had... she's evicted me from my life.
like where'd you work before brown & williamson?
no.
well, it's not very plain.
go? where?
yes.
do yourself a favor:  don't ask.
since i was five. my mom's a cocktail waitress.
how's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
mr. murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
two thirty.
oh, golly. and i forgot to tell you-
because his mother got sick - very sick.  he couldn't leave her.  he's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
what?
you can't escape from me that easily. i'm afraid you don't know who i am.
yep.  how was your trip...?  help me clean up, okay?
yeah.  kidnapping.
so then, mr. mast...
oh god, you're one of those guys...
you're not.
vada, this is an adult writing class.
you're pissed we didn't get credit?
no.
no.  soon as i turn you'll shoot me.
yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
it wasn't like that.
i want to talk about the baby.
fuck you, fuck cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
what makes you say that?
what kind of entertaining?
i don't think so, but it don't really matter. they know i'm meeting you.
no!
i'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
then he gets it out of your share, not mine! not mine!
yeah well fuck you! you just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
larry, we can re-open the beaches in august.
sean!  catch it!
which means we've got one week to start acting like a professional band.
it's like war of the worlds.
yeah, i can't wait to tell howard! it seems really appropriate.
i'm really glad you think so.
i'm only asking you to look at this, doctor. either you will or you won't.
detective dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
maybe.  sure—sure, i've thought about it. who hasn't? if i ever met the right sort of a girl, i'd—  yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? they don't come that way any more.
just a feeling.  nothing personal.
i just got out of a six-year relationship. okay? that should help to explain why i'm acting so weird. it's not you. it's me. i just wanted to say that. sorry.  this is mike. 
okay.
no.
no.
through a wound on his stomach?
because... because i don't know what else to do to please him.
jimmy.  everyone calls me jimmy the finn.
i told you - i'm not very bright.
i'd rather go to viet nam.
what killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. my god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv. we have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
louella, hello, i was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
my goodness, you're embarrassing me.
oh, is he a friend of yours?
nobody.
right... this just glided along.
what's that, peanut?
this means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  now we can all fight together -- all of us.
you ask what room he's in, okay?
well, say something - anything! congratulations, skol - good work, eve!
see the tape. then we can discuss reconciliation. rex screwed up and i nailed his ass. now i'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. then i'm getting on with my life. that's all i'm after.
-- ok --
..suitcase...locker...
it's his nightmare.  he still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
i need you to tell me what you remember.  what happened to us?
no.  yeah... i... i don't know. maybe i did.  leo, this was before pearl harbor.  i was in college. it was a bunch of kids, and i was just one of 'em.  i didn't believe in what they were saying.  hell, i didn't even know what they were saying!
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
me... goffredo, you're mad!  he's mad.
you have beautiful eyes.
oh, lester. he loves his weather, y'know.
yeah, i'll hitch a ride or something. [beat] let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
that's beside the point.
i care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
bloody right i do...
really?
maybe it is! how the fuck would you know?! you don't know a fucking thing! you can't get scared, can you get angry?!
dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  sharp.
well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
look, tim confessed to me last night.
...damn you!  damn you!
a record of the arrests...
no!!!!!
a medicine man?
tomorrow.
i wasn't.  i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio.  he said someone was...
i don't want it.
don't say that, vizzini. please.
don't worry with what. you just start looking for a new place. i'm going to pittsburgh in the morning. the guys from pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
landon. you have two parents. we're both here for you even --
i'm not this way, you know. not usually. i don't fuss and fret over my children.  when frank died...  you see, he knew the children, he really knew them. he had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. that's a rare talent.
or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. quit squawking!
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
i don't think so, sir.  in fact... i think he's a cop.  maybe not lapd, but definitely a badge.
get that gun away from his head, or i'll keep her from coming in!  put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! he's tied up!  put him under the table!
who do i have to fuck to get off this planet?
<u>listen</u>!  we both got something out of it, all right!
ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
he's my father.
you know the difference.
well?
tracks ?
good to see you, diego.
you made...a bust... walter  yeah isn't it wonderful?
thanks, buddy.
...oh bullshit.  you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
well, i want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long i could pick up the phone, call murray and i'd have your job.  you know that?  not too long ago.  for what?  for nothing. "mur, this new kid burns my ass." "shelly, he's out." you're gone before i'm back from lunch.  i bought him a trip to bermuda once...
grace, tell him.
what's it say?
forget it.  i got vegetables coming out my ears.  usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately i ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
calm down, frances.
you want me to walk you?
comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. in a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  people like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. i guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  you're always chasing after something. at least you think you are. truth is, you're just running away.  from yourself, mostly. 'cause you're miserable. you hate yourself. the world's full of people like you. don't know what they want.
well we certainly know that's true.
how do i know i can trust you?
fifty minutes.
all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick. mebbe that's why i allus have such a powerful thrust.
my talisman.  it will, protect against the horseman if i show a brave face.  but, i cannot run.  if i run in fear, it is worthless.
on the rebound.
come on, hank.  a synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
and you think o'brien is that leverage?
no, daniel -- they are not race horses. they are good old friends of mine. i call 'em constitution and bill of rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. i've got one called missouri compromise, too, and then there's a supreme court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
don't be scared.  this time i'm right behind you if you fall.
make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
let's go talk to bill...
well, what about the sex stuff?  what if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
don't be shitty.
really?  and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you?
alex.
no.  i'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
who?
my unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
skeptical...?
but... i thought no one cared about this picture.
mother, is that you?
hmmm.
i think you oughta cut a...
see you over there, miles.
my twenty-five per cent. approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
and now you tell me.
let's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
here?.
as you can see, there's a lot to do.
he just wants me to be someone i'm not.
fine.  i'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
i know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes i don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
my mind's lovely.  and yours?
they don't call them lovers in high school, leland.
can you do that? i mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
well, i'm... glad to hear that –
wait. i want to listen.
yeah.
and what do you do when you in the catacombs?
once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
all this time in the saddle... we get to the farm, i'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
why are you here?
how many pupils do you have?
you're fucking crazy richter--you know that?
look, i've got a wife.  i don't care if either of you ever get caught.
maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
so now cornwallis will head north, link up with clinton and finish off washington.
yes.
i want him.
be careful with those, sonny.
do ,you know how bad you smell? the stench, my god.
well--i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries ...
just so, alfredo. there isn't any. and if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
see ya tomorrow.
oh that's it? everything i do is crap!
where have you been since then?
i'm an honorable clown?
i've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage i could raise-
just myself.
i said take off your fucking shirt.
i bought it. twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum's tv and radio.  well, that just about takes care of it, i guess. you'll be able to watch the ball games. you know, as a little break from your work. 
the perfect couple, i should say.
sure you do.
i'll have me some of that punch there, too.
did you ever see mr. marsh use cocaine?
keep me informed of what he's up to. you help me, i'll help you.
i have to talk to you, alone, j.j., that's why.
i can't afford no better.  my ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  you looking for bernie laplante by any chance?
what?
i am an expert!
aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
it matters not, he is thy king!
i saw him with you.
he has imputed to me conduct unworthy a senator--and i demand he be made to yield the floor--!
mom--i'm not--
no, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. if i push you have to let me back in. dead hero father rule. sir.
no you mean...?
i thought you were in a hurry.
therefore, retreat.
yeah, i remember.
really?  the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey -- i know where anna scott is.  she's in that house with the blue door in notting hill.'  and then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
there is one thing i need right away.
oh, yes.
let's make more popcorn.
oh...
you love him?
i always knew there was more. i felt it.
and i say she won't! i'll not have the scorn of god on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the sabbath!  and as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
ned... is that you, ned?  ned, i seen... death.
mother. i thought you were burglars.
so then what?
what is it?
you can't expect him to learn everything the first day. hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
this is my home.  i'm part of the wallpaper.
you never disappointed me.
when we knock off let's have a bit of a party. we'll drink to god and ireland, its whiskey and its women, to joey and edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
i just walked in.
caesar?
hi.
okay...
joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. an extract from the diary is shown.
ah, the mafia, the cops; do i know how to party or what?
my husband's dead, isn't he?
not until you are eighteen.
no, never before. i've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when i was a little girl. and i fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. but i've never fallen into san francisco bay. have you? ever before?
for christ's sake get him!
no, not yet.
okay.  sure.
i will, dad.  bye, luv you.
no? then what did he say?
about an hour ago, we received this transmission from the north pole.
lest we forget how cruel you are.
like a big sister.
we been down this road.  i told you how it is.  unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
that's 'cause i was cursed with the sultenfuss bear claws.  my hands fit.
on account of my schofield model smith and wesson pistol.
i'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
it's alright. i think he got the message anyway.
the run is tomorrow night, dixie. can you crack its ice pattern?
do i?  i'm a little confused.
do i look like i live in a bottle?
yeah, well, you should be my agent.
salt's good for you, ted.  helps you from getting impotent.
shut up.
oh my god.
if there is a keyser soze he'll be looking for you.
they will never be satisfied with anything else, miss henried. they want human flesh. i'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! not while i'm still using it!
adam --
hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? j. t. s. brown.
plenty more.  and somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
claire...
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. this cake shore is tasty, son.
my uncle's in a coma you moron!
they use the bogan force.
i don't know... i think it was something else... suzie says the bust was bullshit...
you mean tow her back? that's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
shut up.
no...
dinner at the river cafe. au bar afterwards, maybe.
you mean you want us to make copies of yentl, fiddler on the roof, and chaim potok's the chosen?
what?
you took my class in la. you had the best high kick i've ever seen. are you one of my lawyers?
tatum!
i don't care -- she's a cop.  that's the important thing.  cop-ness, not sex-ness.  it won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
i'm always ready to dance. but i need me a kiss first, honey. just one?
i guess it's true. guns don't kill people...
no. i'm visiting relatives.
you miss?  well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
what was it?
you're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte. i tell you that as a friend.
no, i don't.
what lions? i'm not going near any lions.
according to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...marcus halberstam.
yes, sir.
yeah.
i suppose...
yeah. summer vacation. thought i'd travel some. maybe write a little bit.
well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but i do it --
that wasn't my fault.
how'd you learn so much about dreams?
a phoney? whatta you mean, a phoney?
yes.
it's too...
don't swear.
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
it doesn't make any sense.
the hunt club.
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail.
maybe. i think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
i -- i will write to the press -- here -- and in england.  and i will use the courts.
i don't know. i guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
thank you. please sit.
only as a last resort. preserved blood is inferior. there's no flavor left to it, no life.  fortunately, i've found a way around that particular obstacle.
all right, forget this filth. continue about your friend.
to be hanged.
it's alice, ain't it?
found in asia!
pony, what would you say our relationship is?
never reach out!
yes.
...and a russian grandmother...
it's always been that way.  the world has always functioned on two levels.
but, sir!
because you keep conning me, dean. i read your testimony to the warren commission and...
my name is sir launcelot.
no - i'll have you after
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
deal.
jesus, lenny.
uh-huh.
oh.
what?
i have had the honor. 
oh, my god, you mean it was good?
is this bad for him?
no, it - it - nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...
and likewise.
what's the temperature now?
it won't.
you are a liar!
you better not be fucking teasing me.
it's been a few years.
five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
please, gabriel, don't...
what killed them i won't even write about. i tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. they have the future to protect.
what?  you think i'm running you up?
he tried.  it didn't take.
that's all right.
they know.  it's the scent.  we better split 'em up.
i suppose not. gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
tommy  ...
my hands?
you hear about your old friend, diego?
and in return?
terry!
you don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what i mean.
i'll wait for your call.
we're standin' on broken treaty ground, ray. this ain't supposed to be here. it'll poison the water.
yes, she started to but i didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. if we had to listen to everybody...
is he on his own?
my father died in jail, and he was twice the man i am.
stop it!
ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' i don't wanna know from nothin'.
you gonna open up another sal's famous pizzeria?
just because i'm not a vanderbilt, all of a sudden i'm white trash? i grew up in bel air, warner! across the street from aaron spelling! i think most people would agree that's way better than a vanderbilt --
that's under lock and key.
books are good!
no, no. nothing like that. i work in a bank.
you don't like him because he's a yankee. he's a brilliant doctor.
yes!
so we should "wait and see." for how long?
what's so funny?
is that what argon told you?
why does everybody say that? he's the only person i know who doesn't need to use me.
why don't you come down to la? stay with us for a while.
mary. mary, we've got to get going.
- and you got to be girls.
that's clear.
good.
i got money.
but... her army's so small now...
and replaced it later with the new one.  that's your inference?
i can hear myself starting out. "your honor -- i have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  he'd throw the new york state penal code right in my face. -- and it's six volumes.
bloody.
yup.
...well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. there was nothing left to mortgage; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway...
there's nothing to expose.
who?  who's doing this to you?
so am i. but where's my money?
i didn't think you'd make it.
for like, twelve zillion eternities?
don't push it.
so how'd you get chapin to look the other way?
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. i think he felt it too.
who's this guy she's gonna marry?
but i sure don't like that she's leaving.
that's absurd.
thank you.  this is burgess.
you threw it at me!!
does she deserve anything better?
star.
no, we're paying for the wine.
then why did you?
i'm only paying two of you guys.
at least insofar as we have our first casualty.  me.
feeling a bit blue, are we?
baby, don't talk like that.  your rehab's going well.  you'll be back before you know it.
i feel much better. thank you.
you can cut the bow.
i don't know.
surprised!
'snuck up on me....'
so are you!
just tell me the fucking riddle.
i'll call.  i really will.
rollo was a purse snatcher.  my father ran into him off duty.  he shot my father six times and got away clean.  no one even knew who he was.  i made the name up to give him some personality.
what do you mean "you know"?
your blood, max.
no. she was an immigrant.
the party?
the lucky ones.
gosh, i'm sorry, we better get in line.
hey, now, memphis... c'mon, man -
i'm going to try and locate redbeard- i assume you've heard of him.
i can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
not sure at all.
well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. so they ruined my records and made sure i'd never hold a real job again.
no. what had you better--?
don't be ridiculous -- sharks don't take things personally.
cause fuck him, that's why.
cain, mouthing along, with the speech, she looks down, and we see written, on her copy. of his making 
am i right or am i right?
...fine.
a vehicle registered to a william s. hudley.
what does it take to kill you?
i want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
but, my dear duroc, how can i act without guidance from vienna?  i haven't the slightest idea of how the emperor francis might feel about this.
yah!
"local boy inherits more money than god." call me crazy, but i smell human interest.
yes.  i have to go...
plot a course for kronos, lieutenant.
i guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
i'm so embarrassed. i couldn't face him...
the number was 235 - i bet it combination.
yes, well, i suppose you'd know a little something about that.  not to worry.  i'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  and what better way to entice them ... than with a little ivan's ooze?!
out there.  what do you see?
it is time to clarify the situation. everything is over between us.
oh, yeah.
yeah, hurry up.
i took the bandage off yesterday.
no, walking around, like regular people... they can't see each other. some of them don't know they're dead.
who's eichmann?!!?
jesus!
are you going to quit? my last bodyguard quit.
i can't believe i let him stay in my house. right under my nose. that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didn't see him.
come here, son...
you are funny. you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
so what's her name?
hang on... 
help me in!
what are doing with yours?.
ain't we good-timing here ... ?
you get the guns?
she tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
and then you...
because she says if i don't watch out i'll have a baby.
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
what is it, 97 days?
what'll it be like in california, sailor, do you think? i hear it don't rain much there.
that's all for you, sammy.
when will that be ?
when she...
no. you son of a bitch!
i'm sorry -- i'm on edge today.
and who are you?
and i'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
size has no meaning.  it matters not.  look at me.  judge me by my size do you?
no one does nothing, jeff.
it's me...
office of--senator smith?
don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
holy shit!
which half?
is it?
what are you in for, willie?
hey karl, you know what? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february. isn't that somethin'?
i just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
you wanna be sick?
in what way?
i'm thirty-four.
chulo, one thing at a time.
what'll happen. i mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, christ!
the worst?
sheriff, may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates, turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion?  watch your ear, creek.
sure.  bases loaded.
i'll let the senator tell you.
looks like to me you're just plain scared.
rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
can't land ... you'd kill people ...
come over here.
did what take?
showing you what?
...whoever she is.
maybe you will find out.
that don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, lynette! nothing justifies that. i can't believe you're even thinking like that. i mean, that's really backward.
relax, dick, it's just me ... the desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  i want to go home, dick.  time to go home.
what's wrong?
what kind of infection?
who are you?  the undertaker?
footsteps!
what if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? you could sit and read the national geographic.
just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
then your father's a wimp.
did you hurt yourself?  whatd'ya do? step on a thumbtack?
i'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
there is no --
well, i hope you like these! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. or "nori" if you prefer. i love sushi.
i'm swell.
not according to the men in blue.
what's going on?
there's nothing to forgive.
how do you survive?
well, i'm listening now.
what about you, radio?
caesar, i did my best.  the colosseum isn't under my control...
a bad insurance risk?
not yet... section 4236...
we met on the beach.
i believe i am.
dr. chilton.
i might still get there first. the lights are with me.  how would i identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
g'night.
what do you mean -- haywire? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. you're grand! i'm for you! stupendous!
nonsense! we'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. they can cure anything these days.
fi' cents! they pain' you fi' cents?
not at all.  history.
they've become what you wanted. they're a crew.  that's why he came.
he ended up moving back to milwaukee to live with his parents. i haven't heard from him in a long time. poor guy. i warned him.
she's beautiful.  look at her. henry, look at her.
the dead can wait.
who?
just haven't been this close to toontown for awhile.
john parker, tell them we're doing our best.  stall.
isn't it? whose is it?
wait a minute! when did this happen, that we're partners?
i. i don't want to see you tomorrow. mike's coming over.
annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and misery's spirit is still alive--
what?  what do you mean you --
that's gonna end tonight.
it is?
i guess it depends on what you give up on.
why not? it's charming. i mean, i don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! it's not indecent!  it's highly moral, majesty. it's full of proper german virtues. i swear it. absolutely!
well, er, i think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, missus, i'm very fond of music and always have been, especially beethoven, ludwig van... beethoven. b... e... e... he leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
no way, dude! i've looked all over for you, and now you have to tell me how to get wendy to like me!!
she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. she reached down and put me inside her.  my doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  you just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  how deeply you want to please her.  at first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop.  eventually i started to have trouble breathing.  rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  no matter what i said she wouldn't stop. i really thought for a moment i was going to die.
but does it have to be in a cemetery?
i got up.
it's either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i won't know till it's finished.
alright, i'm coming...hold on.
they won't.
just... keep where you are.
yes.
you knew me as a kid.
now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  the bowels of the ship.
i didn't know the answer --
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
just kiss me.  it would mean such a lot to me.
you know that's not what's upsetting me.
-- i have something to tell you. i have to tell you something. i want to change his will, can i change his will?...i need to ---
naw, they ain't stayin' here. but, i know who you're talkin' about. they're stayin' at the hollywood holiday inn.
it was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
i saw it.
yes.
hm? yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
people beat it, don't they?  all the time.
wait a minute, whoa. we can't go now. what's yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
but...
i have a vague idea.
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. there's cars back there, right?
yeah man.
then i'll transpose.
and you?
mr. vanderhof, in public relations, and mr. eichelberger, in mortgage and loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
...whatever. you're like a whining little woman. big deal. you got a fuckin' number. whoopee! you'll fuck it up...
well, i have this very pleasant room on carter street -- and i've been getting to some classes --
i could always apply there.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
why there is no other man in my life?
we're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, johnny?  that wouldn't be... shocking enough.  wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
what?
no... maybe that's not the case. maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
who's got two bucks? it's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old lady and my kids in that motel.
most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  you're good.
and  i love you, pete!
anyway, last time i checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  and i know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so i'm just saying.
but the bridge...
you - you -
you was a golden warrior.
you're him! you're corvis! we fried your ass. you're dead, man!
i'm thinking about moonpies.  ain't that funny?  i haven't had a moonpie since i was ten years old. right now, i'm thinking how much i'd love one.
you'd want to make that go away. you'd want to remind them that treadstone is a training organization.  that it's all theoretical.  you'd want to sign off on that.
you take the stroll down washout lane, you're only proving one thing, johnny.
only what i read in the newspapers.
nature ...
what was his name?
where were you the day he died?
all prop cars accounted for?
i like them french-fried potaters.
look, lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
whole country or just hereabouts?
what else?  keep on keepin' on.
and you notice i'm not in the army anymore.
you were in an accident?
no, something worse. he says it's a surprise, but i know him. this is his masterpiece.
close?  are you insane?  we're nowhere near close!  fuck this, i'll make an anonymous phone call on monday, they'll find the floor safe, and i'll inherit the shit.  little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
why, i--
it's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
soon.  very soon.
no...
i can't do this, honey.
was this during betty?
"he ain't wrong."  listen, i know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. full-time.  and this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>that's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
take it easy. lay down and don't think about it.
if i were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  do you wish to marry me, jack?
where the hell am i going to go?
what is thy bidding, my master?
my life was too weird for her.
i know what you're thinking.  but the truth is, this other person is not someone i'm in love with.  as a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone i like much.  so in a technical sense, i'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
holly, please.  don't insult me.
okey-doke.
stop it.
what does clifford say?
well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
why, sure -- i got it!  do you have a match?
steam.
that's it, ray.  i've had it.  no more parties. i'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
objection. the witness is not an expert in racial classification.
what do you mean?
so someone did get away.
oh, dear.
my daddy gave me this watch.
kirsty.
lit 101 got canceled, so i stopped home and brought you some lunch.
lioness rushes to defense of cub.
what?
no, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
to a private island, like you?
them.  they won't be expecting us.
paul, let me enlighten you about something. you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. i'm off to get laid. see you.
you sure been acting like you were...  ...out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
arrogant.  that's jane butterfield all right...
yeah.  she left with some bikers big ones.  full of sperm.
man, i'd love to have your autograph, snake.
evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
the... chain helps.
we don't have to kill him.  just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  it was your idea, remember?  i'm doing this for you.  i'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
what if there are complications?-
maybe you can, sometime, daniel. i'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing i'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
and what, you'll shoot me? hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, i'd like to make retirement in one piece.
the truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. and do you know why?  yes, you know why.  your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. asshole ! schmuck ! how long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  except me.
lula? i love you, baby. i just want you to be all right.
i've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
you do?
i think she's sweet on him, that's what i think.
we don't have a choice.
a blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? just kidding.
thanks but  i'd better do history.
i did.
it is my business. it's my name.
why didn't you do anything to stop her?
here, you guys.  open them up.
really?
my suitcase was vibrating?
city hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - i see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
then why don't we just get it out of the way.
sorry, comrade ambassador.
what else is ballast for?
oh, god.  i see it!
mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
ricky. my little boy. at least here we've got a house. and i've got a job. okay, i'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  i even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
i said, don't worry about it.
tomorrow.  the buyer is japanese. his retirement a condition of the bonus.
you can't be too careful.
i can't.
what for? to play fats again?
brown's dead, we don't know about blue.
get me ten bags of mulch.
how's that about your being my friend?
but suppose it doesn't?
maybe because they never do.  so don juan, you pass out on all your dates?
if you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
why the fuck you at home? cause i spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  look, i gotta problem. i need help, and you can help me.
sir?
ok.
yeah.  i share it with the dayshift guy.
octavius wasn't the murderer type.
well, thank you for listening. goodbye, mr. doe. you're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
you could always say you have to go the bathroom.
it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command, admiral... also, i must apologize for my attire.  i seem to have misplaced my uniform.
we're not giving up, thelma.
third party?
hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
hi, doc.  had a late call?
and you thought they might be under her dress?
i've been here. what day is it?
you talk to bickerman?
i just struck it rich... i think we can do a little business.  as a matter of fact, i think we can have a party.
staring.  consequently, when he approached me on his way out i wasn't surprised, but i didn't let on.
you shouldn't have.
your father put cigarettes out on you?
not my fault.
no.  can you drive me home?  i'll bring you back in the morning.
sorry we didn't do better, jack. i feel like i let you down.
i just can't. okay?
you're afraid of him.
yes.
charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. he's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
attraction is a complication?
you'll find one of those people.
like i just swam the english channel. now what?
you can't ride with me. the surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
she's my sister.
anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that'd be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that? that's what i'll do. fuck the dole.
no. he wants to be working for himself someday.
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
for your miracle cure?
watts.  those were his keys nell found.  his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to.  i think he's here.
you've been doing your homework. look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
you know what's goin' on?
no, i'm glad....at least i've heard you say it...

shee-it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i'll do, i'll go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?
i'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, mr. gardiner.
his face.
i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
so...the station is empty?
that's my real name!  currently i'm a singer.  sort of.
colon cancer.
that would be... the mexican war?
least i could do for a captain of the enterprise.
hi. come on in. mary!
she wants to kill you.
and you know what else?
now who'd go and do...
thanks.  they weren't related to humpty dumpty, were they? tweedle dum and tweedle dee?

i'm gonna take him, goose.
i'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
i'm a deserter.
who's the other one?
i'll tell mike i'm sick. there's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. afterwards he can go out with the guys. just so the record is kept straight though, i love mike. what do want me to do?
me?
max sayer -- national echo.
i'm all right...
perhaps i no longer need to try.
yup. that's one of the great things about paris. lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
yes, doctor.
life is a burden for me.  nothing gives me any pleasure; i find only sadness in everything around me.  it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
you killed her!
let a thousand flowers bloom. chairman mao.
roger that.  time to kick some ass!
she was just asking about you - whether it was nice to work for you or not.
sidney's father?
you've no thought of going there?
no. the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
why were you spying on the yus?
an interview! do you know what they will do to us...! i thought... sorry.
kincaid got a little frisky last night...so, meet here at eight and go from there?  by the way, i'm brock leviathan.
... i don't even want to talk about the luau.  what's this?
you look beautiful.
top of the world at the stratosphere. it's completely secure. <b> int. fbi jet -- next </b> cosgrove and espinoza listen to this conversation.
i’m fine. i promise.
sit down, and shut up!
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
mantan?  i don't even care as long as i'm dancing.  which reminds me, i need some new kicks.
oh, shit.
like a bug.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
what's  the matter now?
is frank d'angelo around?
you know i don't live with him.
i haven't got an emergency. get out of here.
at the ruins. they're very ancient, you know.
what...?  oh.
what does that mean?
maya? haven't seen her. i think she's off tonight. say, where's your buddy?
i can sit through it once.
i don't see where we are *with* it.
right.
it saved my father!
the forbidden zone was once a paradise. your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
what do <u>you</u> think?  what i need from you:  i need a base of operations.  some place in the district.  i need some clean <u>money</u> ...
i have a right to talk to her. she's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why i've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
what kind of nuts?
about a dozen officers and men.
are you alright?
tell her i'm eating.
you're doing real good. can't you figure it out? i wanna finish this where it all began. woodsboro.
charles.
chill?  since when do you say ch...
this is a delicate matter.
let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
hm.
do you know what i'm looking at robert?
never needed one.  i've never been anywhere.  i've got a backpack.
it's for your finger.
i can't speak for him.
nope.
thank you.
not at all.  but on the other hand, i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other.  that is precisely the point of a long dining table.  the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
but we know who killed maureen prescott, billy loomis and stu macher.  i mean, they even told sidney how they did it!
stan?! you started la resistance?
right.
ah, doctor's ethics. if you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
but can we date?
please... wait.
think hard -- it'll come to you...
it's a gig.
... digitized.
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? when he put me in that trance...
found a job?
i ain't about to argue with you.  what's gonna happen to them three? ross the boss and those ladies?
i'm not scared of ralph lauren. those are <u>sheets</u>.  are you gross under there?  are you <u>night of the</u> <u>living dead</u> under there?  like all bloody veins and pus?
jag gets here in three hours. try for the confession.
it was a gift. it isn't worth anything at all?
come on, a wuss like me?  the stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
we're coming with you.
hurry back.
:well, they are.
nothing.
how?
i don't report the car and i don't know either of you?
amends...?
are you all right?
we were looking for this bird.
what!
i already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
it's bullwinkle.
i felt limited. i felt confined. i felt like i was suffocating.
okay.
we want to see you.
there are some things, my dear conway, i deeply regret i may not discuss.
what class?
when you get to fiji?
what is?
what are you doing here?
i don't know why i said it. i'm sorry.
listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
let's just do it and get out of here.
yeah. to civilians. but they're hackers. but don't worry. all we have to do is launch the da vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
where is your courage, comrade buljanoff?
you have fed. you were made for this...
so, what's <u>your</u> name?  it'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
neither can i.  not any of it. there's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. it's a clean break in the fabric of the universe; a gap.  there is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
15-band closes down at night.  during the day you can chew the band with china if you want.
it was a payoff and an insult.  ingen never--
oh please, ford, i'll do any --
is there any danger? some kind of virus?
i will not repeat your mistake. i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative.
you want me to make you a sling? it's no problem...
i looked up to you, uncle.  my brother always said i was a fool. never trust the british, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
what difference does it make? we'll be out of the country friday.
you have anything to drink? you want to go out and get something?
yes, sir, i did.
a rough estimate.
mccay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
i usually don't.
yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. you dig? there's nothing in there now.
it's too late.  argon injected it.
..."a boy named sue". i think that's why he's such a bad cat.
his nickname is "the hammer."
me...
no.
i think so.
yes, i'll do it.  just leave my family alone.
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
huh.  jeez.  well, so, did he--is that yoga?
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.
he phoned it in.
hey now!  no cussing on tv!  well in closing i'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  one is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
no, sir... just a businessman.
really.
i'm not sure. i haven't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival.
it's ok, boy.
you know in the movies, i play you as being much smarter.
where's luh?
she's still alive?
is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
the bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
i think that you know.
baby?  right on time.
yes, mikey?
not far. just a little way.
i defy any and all limits.
huh?  whadda you mean?
i'm going home!
i-i'm sorry - can someone else please run the ouija board?  it's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior, jesus christ.
great.
i'm just making a point.  you have no idea what you're asking.  how much trust two people need to do something like this.
that's why they're always moving. they have to have it.
how dare you tell me to run my affairs!
i...
no thanks - 
what about jewelry?
are you taking them still?
listen, alice ...
...and a fortune teller.
we're not outta here yet.
surely you've heard the stories? the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
if you think i'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
a complaint follow-up form.
that's why she's givin' up my money huh? not that bullshit about melanie. i didn't trust her ass neither, but i knew how to handle her. she was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. i fuckin' told louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. she's at your office.
right beside you.  i borrowed viktor's car.
what?
then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like hemolytic anemia?
what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
i don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
why not?
it's just a party. daddy, but i knew you'd forbid me to go since "gloria steinem" over there isn't going --
you find something curious in that?
it's a thought.
hey.
that's what i gotta tell you. she bugged me the whole time. got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag. started running her fuckin' mouth... i couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "is it this aisle lou- is, is it that one?" she was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
mrs. sutphin?
it'll do fine.
they're playin' the buckeyes!
yeah?  so?
are you sure?
we didn't miss anything.
forget it. i'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
far out.
look, kittle... pull over and let me out.  i'll be fine... okay?  how 'bout that... ?  oh, lord almighty, listen to me... i don't want to die!!  lemme out of this coffin!!
i'm looking for you, actually.
that bugs you too?
i've tried to stay out of it.  but it turns out that's not so easy, sam.  you've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  mitchell stephens. you and risa and wendell and the ottos.
look, this is not my field of expertise. you seem stabilized, but why take any chances? let's keep you overnight and have the staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
precursor shipments from ras tanura and ju'aymah?
red.  what else?
well, why don't you share them with us?
can't we get out of here?
depression?
even later.
i'm tired.  i need to rest.
how do you mean that?
he jests at scars that never felt a wound. but, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? it is the east, and juliet is the sun. arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief, that thou her maid art far more fair than she: be not her maid, since she is envious; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. it is my lady, o, it is my love! o, that she knew she were!
hello.
jean baptiste!
or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
what do you do that for?
what's the best fortune you ever got?
uh--senator--i thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
place all alone like that?  must be a boarder check point.
first you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! makes a person feel cheap.
she's next.  in two or three more minutes she'll be free.
you've got it, master.
we have to get off this ship!!
i never heard nothin' about it.
sorry, dude. just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
no.
epps?
we will.  we <u>have</u> to.  come on, vlad - she's out there.
you better get over to al's. now.

by all means.
yes, because i know they'll read it.
i'd be you.
alright!  let's put it on film. camera!  sound!
naw naw!
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
when you were so depressed after you shot mr. garrett jacob hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  and why shouldn't it feel good?! it must feel good to god. god does it all the time!
forget who i am.  where's this school located?
is mom... in there?
don't look so shocked, phillippe. come, you're going back to prison.
wes is dead!
yes.
keep tasting...
thank you.
you're welcome.
oh, that—
i can't tell you, theo.
david?
not exactly, but i want to be one, like you.
did i tell ya it's great to see ya again?
but...
great.
because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
it was something my father always liked me to do.
i intend to keep you alive, your majesty. so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord.
why do you say that?
raise the shields...
twenty miles?  i see.
he'll live.
what i did to joey.
that's great! we'll have the fare in no time!
they were partners.
ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill?
i misplaced an important complaint. that's their story. want to hear mine?
freezing. maybe a couple degrees over.
i think they're getting worse.
what happened?
couldn’t nazi hunters do the job?
i didn't throw him, he fell.
stop it!  i want to read them! if you don't want to, then just leave. but don't you push me around like i'm some mule you paid for -- i already got a husband!
oh, n-no, sir. the sea-gull is a lovely bird.
to the hospital.
in downtown sydney for a start.
i've got something in my bag.
stake you?
well, there's some flaws in her...
i can't really go into it right now. i'll just tell you it's someone big.
i saw him.
how have you dumped girls in the past?
i thought redding had like three balls!
figured what out?
bert williams and the rest, they had to black up.  they had no choice.  they were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  did you know that's written in the constitution of the united states?
that's not what they're tellin' me.
donovan!
follow me.
good morning, schulz. and how's mrs. schulz? and all the little schulzes?
the refridgerator.
a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, i should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  that would kill it.
you're giving them to me?
dawson, huh? was i very drunk last night?
really.  he has a cop's face.
oh yes! yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' pony ride back to the hotel.
i've gone this far, and right now i think i'm in better shape than you.
no.  you're trying to beat me.
because he's not forty feet tall.  the safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
it was six in the fucking morning.
i'm not going to go, george. i changed my mind.
why should i?  you need practice. i can teach you to fight with the green destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
how much money has he got?
-- will be handled back in --
why does rachel scream?
they're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
madame is waiting.
all right.  mission accomplished.
where is the film crew from the british museum?
just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  it's like the biggest thing in her life.
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
daddy -- stop it!
what a coincidence, i am someone!  mmm. calvin klein's obsession. now it's mine too.
uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
what?
yes. good morning, saunders.  have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
...using steroids.  i was a juicer. diabonol, then, wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for christsake.  now i'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. about our place in their colonization.
he did have pointed ears.
i ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. i'm reaching' a point where i'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
and where did he go to school?
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham. it has been destroyed. women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
we'll make it, we'll be fine.
as i testified.  it occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  i believe i said that.
please, i want to wake up. leave me alone. it's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
shitbutt?
i know, but...
you are very important, willow.
all right, move! move! rock your chair. do what i do.
whoa...whoa...wait a second, jack.  you’re not actually gonna cheat on kate?
you bit my finger.
well, gee, i try and have a heart.
fuck you.  anyway, minister farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the black man will rise.  "we will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  you really believe that shit?
ever since i've known you.
well cooper...
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state. france is going to uphold that ownership.
mr. soze will be most -
oh, come now! you threw a time bomb.
oh the way out of the crab house? we asked michael if we could see the ring?
buffy...

yes?
i'll tell you what's -- aaaah!
he's like the biggest idiot of all time!
she's here.

the last time i took orders from you i ended up with five years probation.
david --
you know, i don't love anybody.
but who was the devil?
grigory yefimovich rasputin --
where do you fit?
these chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
huh uh. a jockey. his name's, um, curtis... curtis hardapple.
that's it. that's it. breathe easy.
we haven't located her dad yet.
what? why?
i'll wait.
eight thirty.
knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
there are no saints today. good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those i'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
of what sort?
have we ever met before?
yes.  i did.  this morning.  what i'm saying to you: things can change.  you see?  this is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  you can't look down the road.  and see what's coming.  might be someone else, john.  it might be someone new, eh?  someone new.  and you can't look back. 'cause you don't know history.  you ask them.  when we were at rio rancho, who was top man?  a month...?  two months...? eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  you know what that means?  you know what that means? is that luck?  is that some, some, some purloined leads?  that's skill. that's talent, that's, that's...
marylin rexroth? when does she --
you think this is so easy?
uh-huh.  did you ever hear of chalmers bryant?
i just needed some extra money.  i was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
you know what i'm talking about.
we'll be expecting you.
but you do. what does that say about you, ray? what does that say about me? i've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. but he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess i'm gonna have to school you myself.
no. loretta called. there's been a... a fire.
eleven a.m. they're gone.
no, don't do that.
the gear is down.
i've never heard of a cure.
i sure hope you don't.  i gotta get outta here, good night.
that was hare's end. ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
you're out of shape.
why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.
all right. be careful.
what for?
what?
i want it...
where were you?
randy somebody.
is it? i expected to go to the vancouver royal. should i have a reservation?
i'm standing next to kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
kind of. ted peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
who is this...?
they use' to be a sayin': a chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. an' another: born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. that's the way i always heard it.
greeks?

i love you.  i just wanted to say it.
you decide.
what's that supposed to mean?
-- c'mon, i'll get you home...
naw, that's some stupid shit.  now you know how i got that name.
no, just one.
can't you see?  it's raining!
well, i mean... you know, i gotta ask you. that's a lot of money. you're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. i mean...
well, i've been tracking them down all morning.
it's not a boat boat.  it's really a house.
i don't know. i had to duck to get the story out. he was so far along he never even missed me.
let's go.  i'll brief you in the air.

any activity?
let's wait on the power cells.

well sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to maureen.
we're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
i'd never be able to talk her into it. and even if i could, those things cost money. and that's just what i don't have. i'm flat out dead broke.
we're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. and the perception is that crystal lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  that, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
going on?
is on its way ... the helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
who are you revolting against?
i did not ask you to, did i?
hello, eddie's girl...  i looked all over for you.
what's the matter with your leg?
benny, there's nothing there.
excuse me? what's your name, son?
very good, steed ...
i never saw you.
who was that person mother?  was it you?
yes.  with your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel.
take a bow. customs had some paper on his alias. they stopped a carton two years ago at lax - live caterpillars from surinam. the addressee was "john grant." calumet power & light's given us two possible residences under that alias. we're hitting one, chicago swat's taking the other.
closin' down, sir.
well, it's been known to happen in the day too. maybe agnes went to him.
then why let her out of our sight? besides, she's all we've got...
alive... i'm alive...
point, lupus. give us a point.
the cops and company raise hell they find out.
dr. bennett. it's good to see you.  my wife, josephine.

tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
i went for a drive. up in the hills.
a three-second burn to port, on my mark.

why should you care?
are you so superstitious?
i ain't ever gonna fight joe louis, that's what's the matter.
people notice you frida.
at least a day.
after all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
and the grass?
we'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
yes i do.
but aren't you...
what?
what's wrong?
how could you?
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
two men left town right after it happened.
he's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
i don't feel like going, angie. i thought i'd take this girl to a movie.

general schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base, hq 843rd wing.  it was apparently directed to their wing on air- borne alert.  it decoded as - wing attack, plan-r.
he asked you not to grieve...
truthfully?  there has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, i'd never built in africa.
what the fuck are you talking about?
alright.
not as far as the election goes.
no, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. fuckin' lights and everything!

i'm not. but you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
just makes to so god damned mad ..

okay so... what's the safest place?
that's right. more than four thousand pictures of the same place. the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  that's why i can never take a vacation. i've got to be in my spot every morning. every morning in the same spot at the same time.
why not?
no.

i really think you're overreacting in this whole -
we already did.
do you?

i warned you...  ...but i'm sorry.
tell him we'll meet.
then what?
he's on to something bigger.
must've been a cheap date.

even poor people have t.v.s
and they want me to make up for it.
i'm a simultaneous translator -- like sylvie, only she's english to french -- i'm french to english. that's what i did before i married charles. the police probably think i killed him.

and he's dead serious.
this is fifty bucks.  i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
oh, you're gonna love this:
alright, i'm worried about christmas. i wish i hadn't told him i'd be back ..
i don't care *what* you've done! don't quit. don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. as long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
i don't know.
why, that's from time magazine.
jack...
what? what happened?
what happened to cole?
you're hurting.
you are, i was about to say, no longer eligible.
well! i'm not talking about mac. he hasn't toughed me for ages. and not often ever. my life started when mac went on nights.
good.
god knows, i'm intriguing.
"cinderella man grows hair on chest!"

yeah, mom?
and what happens then?
see!  that's what i like about you, man!  you're just sharp as a razor blade.
somewhere else?
i don't know.  it just went dead.
i don't know why i feel so good. i haven't felt this good in a long time.
dead... they're dead... and buried.
your help?  what are you talking about?
good.  he never doubted you.
just a second, mr. president.
do you have life support?
thanks for the vote of confidence.
--you'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
great.
maybe it would if i took it.
sorry, i don't remember.
go catch jimmy, ray. really. he's gettin' away. go ahead, go get him. i'm late.
but it's ten-thirty at night.
some tap dancing, some singing.
no thinking. the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
i couldn't kill buzz. i need his help. theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
i... i don't understand.
can we just get back to kobayashi?
of course it is.  is it loaded?
i couldn't... oh, god.  you... came here... to stop me?
the senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  also, some of the judges...they've all sent gifts. and another call from virgil sollozzo.
why were you given notice?
nothing that can't be exchanged.
yeah.
you're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
just say so.
what's the blue book price?
[beat] i do it.
what have you found out?
i rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
you say, john, cut our losses and all the rest.  but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others. jesus, you'd never recover from that, john.  it's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
shit!
it'll be wonderful.  we'll be at peace.  in the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
sam, haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. how could he get there? he can't drive.
that's right. because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
[no!]
he's not finished.
excellent. my friend and i are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a syrah.
it has worked.
they'll be anchored on the lee side.  haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
tell me what happened.
see ya tomorrow.
she is preparing a great abundance of food.
you sure i can't go with ya?
yeah... i guess.
did you know that after that song was recorded, jan himself crashed his --
seventeen.
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  definitely third category.
leave. take this shit back to detroit and get the rest of our money.
one more sweep... one more sweep.  i'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. we're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
they may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... other than that, ask what you wish.
i don't know.
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  she's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  i only watched what i could.
i think its meaning is clear.
you tell the boy who knocked you up?
hold on, son...who's this colonel greenhill you're talking about?
what about me?
i'll say.  holy moley.
anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, i can see that, i'm on your manor now, right.  so there's no need to get out of your pram.  i'm johnny-come-lately to all this.  whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  i don't wanna know.
you've been saying that for twenty years. while we were dating, you said it.
no. i mean, i don't believe it. lilly is not a suicide. i know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
yeah, but it's all about simon now... you helped with the dog... and now there are other things. i'm just as concerned as you are about simon.
you have to sleep for three.
[he sounded strong to me. stronger than we are.]
get the hose!  we've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
stop the tape, okay.  forget it, ellen.  let's call security and get him out.
i'm afraid. i'm afraid if paulie finds out.
making it with my mother?
what do you want to do?
you're ready, don't worry.
yamaha white.  nice.
i'm sorry.
are they polar bears, too?
was.
up.
i meant all the choices here. all this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  this is some picnic!
it ain't done, if that's what you mean.
captain who?
smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
a g...g...g...
we do survive, don't we?  you're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. that's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  no rush about that. just remember to apologize sometime soon.
how do you know?
so i stay. stay until i hustle up enough to play fats again. maybe by that time i'll develop myself some character.
nothing is easy.
don't tell me about your problems, boy. explain them to ho-jon.
oh, you need a shave. you mustn't go looking like that. there's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. compliments of the house.
yeah... well... i'll see you tomorrow, rob.
'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
here it come: one-two-
no, you don't want to hear that.
i thought you wanted to.
give it yourself.
you're blind, dude. blind.
yes, ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
now wait a minute, gerry--
what do you think she is, madeleine? a doll?
no more games.
yeah.  i got an idea. come on, let's get to a telephone.
i'm not sure.
right home after. see you.
no, you?
got something to show me first?
huh? huh huh.
what?
right?
dan, great to see you again. like i said, you need anything at all, i'm your man. i don't envy your job. i mean owen was a...complex man.
my daughter. i haven't been on a bike for years.  when was the last time you rode a bike?
do you know where danang is?
oh, no, i'm fine...fine.
did ya win?
well... i think i... i would've remembered.
why not?
thanks, wick.
no, boy. thirty-eight cents worth of gas. and watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
ten to one, it belonged to cliff brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. right along the coast. isn't that right, thorpey?
i'm glad we talked.
what of it? i'm going to die in casablanca. it's a good spot for it.
take the card.
... but he's...?
autumn is coming.  i'll shut the windows for you.
miss caswell is an actress. a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts.  ah... eve.
what'd you do?
no, this is gonna work! i just gotta get close enough to talk to her. takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named waldrip.  i'm goddamn bona fide. i've got the answers!
well, to make the figures come out even -- since i have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
they arrived, can you believe it?
we'll see about that.
then the thighs where they joined the torso.
no. it wasn't me. i didn't.
i know what you went through tonight.  i kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
gotta go, man.
yes, please.  i'm looking for all beef patties.
you mean--beyond pacifism?
your whores never showed up.
it happens that i'm the law.
so so.  up and down.
if you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
there's somebody lookin' for me. not police. just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
great, isn't it?
i'd love to.
they've all tried. nobody's got to first base.
no, john, you're too hard on yourself.  i've got the creep here, the guy who's...
what?
please, beverly, this is hard enough.
what does it matter? she'll live again. you'll make her.
fast.
all right. you got it. you win. i'll deliver it now.  just give me a moment to set it up.
oh. nothing... sitting.
get out.
will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
my grandchild-baby.
worse.
skipper...
and i have no idea why.
their atmosphere will sustain him. he will look like one of them.
thank you, miss -- ?
if that's the way you want it.
you're crazy.
hurry, norman.  four minutes.
certainly.
okay... would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
my... the wild west.
we got to talk.
i guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
so shoot him.  won't have to feed him that way --
darrell.
no, really, thank you. -- is mrs. webster coming back soon?
yes.  the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
i...i can't.
oh, really?  one-hundred billion dollars.  ok, make it happen. anything else?
he only appears to be inside the cage.  the point being...
all he can. all he can.
i was crossed-trained in gunships.
is that what you think?
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
sid! oh, it's beautiful! you mean...
hurting your feelings? has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? listen to me, i'm talking to a hamburger!
oh, don't be silly, walter. i couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. i'd be arrested.
the same.
i can handle it.
goodnight, mr. carpenter.
yeah.
please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
you don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
that dirty bastard! i knew it! he's got hold of my woman!
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
i don't have the money for those bourgeois traps. hell, i'm making what a czech earns.
warsaw's not the only radio station.
look, i can help. you need a sensor expert. you've got one.
don't ask.
it's probably trivial.
i have to go.
what kind of a deal?
you don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, cole?  have it taken away?
i put on a lot of weight over christmas.
well, i... i... that's very nice of you.
what about it?
i know that.  i've seen the photo's.
it's a lot to digest. imagine how you'd feel.
would the network really not run it without the interview?
she's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
well, no, johnny, i just thought i should've been told if—
that soulless monster gets no tears from me.
hold on...  yep. and abbott just direct dialed moscow from his room...
so, he knows where you are. that means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
how's that, quince?
as far as -- sonora?
i know that.
bye, bye, claudia.
sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
cause we got footprints leading into that brush, i want to see where it leads...  jesus, seven dead.  i'll tell you i've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  i don't like it.  not in my jurisdiction.
look, maybe i'd better take my car --
it will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
you are such a sweetheart.
no, i gotta do something.  i don't suppose you'd card-
johnny cammareri. i think it's great and about time. what's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
we know.  we know.  yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  not this injustice. nah, no way.  dem' two real coons iz ill.
charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
yes, i know—but—
i kinda doubt that. we're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
i don't care. she's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
when you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
you're the reason i never met him. you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
for what?  he left.  not me.
what?
they're gone.  and there is nothing you or i can do to bring them back. but there is something you can do to help end all this.
could be a stroke. who knows?  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "like wild dogs."
...i don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
i'm not your lawyer until i see the money.
yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. a key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
why, there's nothing on the news?
looks old.
good. glad to see they're together at last. they don't get along. promotion. top job. most unfair. quite a fuss at the ministry.
you know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
figures.

emily...
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.
oh, the complete works of jacqueline susan, the novels of harold robbins....
i think you do.  but i thank god we all don't.
well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
that is for the urn.
yeah, right... believe me, at this point i'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
ruins. not rocks. the remains of trondham abbey. built on an intersection of ley lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
all right.
no.
i don't understand.  track 2's chile?
thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run. that oughta be enough.
it's been a while.  maybe i'm just out of practice.
that's... wonderful. it's just... i thought...
well... uh... thanks...
look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what i mean.  ooh, i like her.
why? what are you gonna do? huh? you're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
what about my coat?  i'll freeze.
no, thelma.  i'm not gonna make any deals.
let's hope not. license and registration please.
yeah. me and a friend of mine. he's outside.
ten dollars. but i need it to get home.
jealous?
no, it don't have to be fifty. it can be thirty... twenty-five.
finally. i was getting tired of watching him try every night.
i wouldn't put it that way. but i love sharks.
make me an offer.
then if you don't mind...  i'm gonna pass out.
sue me.
what the fuck are you? a drug counselor or a drug dealer? and you don't even do your own product! what kind of businessman are you?
such as?...
blue eyes, yes, sir.
suits me.
your father's dead.  don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  i don't want another word.  finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
excuse me?
what's wrong with your leg, daddy?
&quot;in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
you don't aim to kill nobody, tom!
a harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
thirty-thousand, i think. closer to the top.
i'll take care of you.
who do you think i am?
where are you, ol' buddy?
calm down. just listen for a minute.. please.
people do have heart attacks.
oh! you're supposed to fasten it!
i certainly hope so -- i loved susan from the moment she was born, and i love her now, and every minute in between, and what i dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
uh, no.  how do i get to beverly hills?
no.
what do you want me to say?
thank you.  benjamin --
c-c-c-c-candy!
what do you mean, sir?
you heard me.  count it out.
a safe room.  an inner sanctum.  a castle keep, in medieval times.
in a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
those aren't real memories. no one has that kind of recall.
what kind of look?
xxxxxx
where did you find it?
what? everybody knows god is white.
i can make wishes like this come true.  i'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
a porco?
hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, senator.  the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
an old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, i figured this was coming sooner or later -- is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
you'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  that's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
then you think it might have worked out?
i'm cold ... so cold ...
shut up!  drop it.
...regression of modern man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
yonelle.  looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  fuckin' animals.
back up. go out the other way.
there's a slight difference.
and do you trust me?
you said i could pick out a jacket and i just... sorry.
no.
what's he on about?
last one down springs for room service.
a rich actress.
i don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
alright. why so pissed?
i can go hotter!
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
against a window.
there is nothing there.  not anymore.
never mind.  he died two years ago.
i'll tell you what, if i'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, i'll let you know and we'll split the money.
i could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
those two musicians from the garage!
no. please. they're going to arrest you.
i gave them me.  said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but don't worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.
i checked. there was no divorce.
my what?
what time is your rendezvous?
groovy.  i've never felt better in my life.
upstairs.
i love you.
you're beautiful. let's have sex.
god, i should know. your hair was red. i remember it matched the wallpaper.
people more serious about their work. you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
call up the bank.  i called them.
well, barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the air-conditioning system.
heavy weather east of here.
why?
i had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
yeah.
what?
i just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  all the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
i hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, nathan.
what?
i'm all ears.
you going to take me on a nature walk?
beeeee careful.
why?
no.
oh, yeah.
if the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. there would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
just...say...no!
here. got pictures.
sure.
just knock it off, 'kay? anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
huh?
you'll never understand. me and you, wayne, we're not even the same species. i used to be you...then i evolved. from where you're standing, you're a man. from where i'm standing, you're a ape. i'm here...i'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. you say why? i say why not?
why'd he do it?
not here... alone.  may we? please?
but what am i gonna transform??
he taught all this to swann?
i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it's such a shame.
no.
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
it will take them five minutes!  how long ago did they arrive?
i know.  she needs to slow down.  she's going to blow an o-ring.
no, my lord.
this is the dumbest thing i will ever do.  so dumb, in fact, that i can't.  i don't think.
he was a con man, wasn't he?
...how's the paintin' goin'?
it's history. i gotta go.
good lord.  how'd you get it on tape?
maybe we should do something?
wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  is eve around? i'd like to say hello.
sorry.  it's the first time i've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
i don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  i wish i had a ruler.
no, there's a police car way back there.  see it, in the distance coming around the turn?  the van is blocking it now.
i need to confess.
reach for it and throw it to me. and... my finger’s on the trigger, you hear!
they're paying him scale.
...hello?
has this ever happened before?
it was just like she described them in her book. like they were alive. the way that they looked... moved... smelled. they were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  i followed my spear... and i found something...
what kind?
what about the dog?
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
i've been working out.
she's my gynecologist.
out!
<u>someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on dr. lechter's head. 
you promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
enough!
they gave you only four days?
you and creasy both. a two man army according to interpol. panama. lebanon with the druze. desert storm. where you were contracted by the u.s. army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders.  you two were a married couple.
oh, you'll help him now, richard, won't you? you'll see that he gets out? then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
that's just one example. my reporting has made a difference.
let's just find someplace.
if she is, the machine works.
you're right.  you're absolutely right.  i'm a nothing.  i spend my life counting other people's money -- people i'm smarter than, better than.  where's my share? where's leo bloom's share?  i want, i want, i want, i want everything i've ever seen in the movies!
should we go outside and bring him in?
i don't mind.
there was this case.  a serial.  he murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  the papers called them the nightingale murders.  they never caught him.  but the killings just stopped.
i don't think i belong here.
starting with a screw?
so...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
but you're not a girl.  you're a guy! and why would a guy want to marry a guy?
you know otherwise, freddie?
sure.  twinkie?
1995?
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates...
i think maybe you'd better deliver him. let me give you my address. 
did it occur to you they might find us?
put a fork in me harry, lets get started.
yes, doolittle.
right ben. let's go fuck. i'll fuck anything that moves.
what are you afraid of?  i'm the one's got the gun.  stay here.
you can and you will! swim, rennie!
i must only let the red rage...
are they okay?
thank you.
maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
i think i have... i could be wrong. i have been before. just remember one thing. if you're not top gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... you're gonna have to act like the rest of us. you're gonna have to master humility. for you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
been hearing voices.
why didn't you?  you knew she was keeping her home from school. you knew she was an alcoholic.
okay. let's go shopping.
good.
i ain't dense. and he's been here twenty minutes.
uh-huh.
the little boat flipped over. a virus planted in the gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
why? is this about the book?
first, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. especially where custody is involved.  got it?
tuesday.
oh, come on, bill.  don't patronize me.   i'm not one of your little...  turn around.  i'm talking to you!... turnaround!
who?
where is my wife?
spoken words?
poor mr. price --
about the accident.
you're amazing.
mother's not half so blind as you.
okay, walter. 
you're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, ace?
when do you think it'll be done?
what do you mean?
what do you expect me to do, thank him?
what is it -- i can't tell anything --
maybe you should be.
maybe i don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
any idea who could've done it?
wilson, do you believe this?  take the damn water.
hundreds! which one is your pet?
the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
oh, hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
yeah, too bad.  they were real nice lookin' too...in bed together, hardly any clothes one watching tv...
always.
oh!
yeah, mick.  i've got the money. i'm staring right at it.
why would you care?
very encouraging. most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
it's a simple story. earl williams works for the e.j. mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job.  take it away, fred wilson!
i'm a nurse.  i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital.  dr. paley's on staff there.
edward bloom.
didn't this "information" come from the joe boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you shu kai kim, a korean, an outsider?
because what i am interested in is right here...
i understand.  a death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
i didn't mean to make a fool of you.
oh just my wolf paraphernalia. some people collect beanie babies... i collect silver bullets.
there are differences.
that boy wants me to.
nasty way to go.
no problem.
the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
i'm sorry.  i have to bring you to a cell.
i got the ring. <i></i> tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.
you missed him? you didn't...?
you want to take a walk with me?
you promised.
i uh, by and by i come--but if thou mean'st not well, i do beseech thee--
junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. that's why i do not eat over there now.
but i don't do drugs!  and i don't enjoy making light of them!  i was promised creative control!
a what?
...you're hurting me...
it goes away ... it'll go away.
who are you? what is your name?
great to be here.
lice?
there's nothing fast enough to catch that. forget it. it's over.
what do maniacs always want?
i said welcome.
we are...for the tools.
go away from me.  you frighten me.  sit over there.
my pleasure.
sure.
you don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  or me.  or us.  remember...
dad'd be proud --
can you watch gideon for a while? one of the girls is going into labor. junior is going to drive me over.
bob?
in time you will meet them all.
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him?
his mother's an only child.
dumont!
no ...
not the better half.
to be strong and free... that is all i desire.
i hear ya.
just looking.
she my foster.
eh?
i dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
linnea?
better than what you give.
what if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  what if he turned?
we should check the records, and, we should talk to lynn.
what is it?
anti-semite!
let's go take a look at that trooper.
i can't see!  how can i fight?
"a history of the united states, volume i." if you want to read a real history book, read howard zinn's "a people's history of the united states." that book will knock you on your ass.
my poor baby!
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
i'm sorry.
of course it's the place.
so if i gave you my life, what would you do with it? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? or could you change? could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? a father's words you never heard? could you do that?
never felt better.
it's okay..it's okay.
i thought you were going to take him that night but...
thanks, doc, but i don't need an aids test. are you crazy? but thanks for the information. really.
- i'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the prime minister. but this is, still, a naval operation.
i expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. until then, i'm imposing my own electronic silence: for the sake of the economy, not a word to nato, the press, the cia.  ...and so long as commander bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, i want him to go along as an observer. are we agreed?
profitable.
or a vegetarian?
no. never had much use for hell-howlers. you goin'?
we need a warrant.
no joke, lieutenant.
yes you are.  i'm not just some reporter.  i don't just stick a microphone in your face.  you could give me something.
"myers", huh? you have a first name??
superman gets mail here?
not all tradition is bad, mrs. peel. no thank you.
evening, annie.
you won't say that in a week.
i'm afraid she is, baby.
i'm the one.  i did it.  i tore down paul's posters.
he does bless me, each and every day. matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so i pick him up at school. we stop for a meal usually around this time. he does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. but we never had a famous mobster before.
give me a date, doctor.
he's not here!  tyler's not here anymore!  he's gone away!
but i only had sex with telly.
she's not for you.
no one, sir.  before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
i'm sorry, christ, i'm sorry!  how many more times do i have to say i'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
you're a tourist.  i saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
high school and college, yes.  pretty hokey, huh?  i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry.  god... he was the funniest man i'd ever met.
what's the matter with her?
the house is not full -- is it really full?
no. hell, no! you eddie felson?
well.  what about it?
what does it say?
that's enough.
ohhh, i can't bear to watch.
uh, atomic energy?
down kensington church street, then knightsbridge, then hyde park corner.
get it out of here!
supportive?  you weren't being supportive.  you were being scared. just like now.  you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on.
well, for starters, what do you do? where're ya from? what's your favorite color? who's your favorite movie star? what kinda music do you like? what are your turn-ons and turn-offs? do you have a fella? what's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? and, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
maybe.
what do you mean?
i haven't seen anybody doing that.
i see. we need to get you one of those plant misters. we can spray you like a fern.
fine.
i'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  and don't worry about the vase.
we're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
right over there.
how would you know if bobby didn't give her that?
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they're saying that you don't cooperate.
inside, out-fuckin'-side. i don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
sure you can....
like what?
oh. you like her?
always.
no problem. what's on your mind?
they are brutes without feeling. though i admit that i've requested cremation for myself. burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. to say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
they also found my two beam scale in the garage.
we could put it somewhere.
i was?  how you spell that?
amen to that.
how do you mean?                                            ]
yes.  we have heaven.
in this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
you mean with malkovich?
keeps fairies away!
darnedest thing i ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
inspector halloran, homicide.  i'm in charge here.
woody!  the rocket!
the airport? why? are you leaving?
it's beautiful.
what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army -- and the police?
your command is my wish, princess lili.
we're not certain...
gallagher, this is mrs. smith.
hey, the poet...
i thought you quit school. last i heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in brazil.
of course. i'm aware of the geneva convention. they will be given the burial they deserve. or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the eastern front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
oh, are you a spy for the other side?
anya! what if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
the 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  a government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  you know, messy... thinking.  they want a dictator!  as far as the children, there is only one thing that every roman child dreams of:  being you! a famous gladiator!
what evidence?
once the orders have been given, plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft.  but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
in any event, my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else. someone chaste... pure... innocent.
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  there's no way you're going back in!
that's why i'm letting you take care of this.  i'm the one with appearances to maintain.  but who gives a shit about you?  not even god.
yes.  she's very old.  she's been with us since the beginning.
i see.
you remember miriam....
hiding.
but what if we leave them behind?
good work, my son.  now all we need is a way to get there.
guys.  sometimes friends.  mostly guys.
really, fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
admiral? he didn't tell you how <u>admiral</u> kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
now i can start to live.  to feel. to grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
i beg your pardon?
no.
betty would never dress like that. she's not some trailer park slut!
working for the district attorney.
los angeles.
yes i am. i'm working on a wres – please call me barton.
no. sit down.
that's why you bombed the building. the infected firemen, the boy --
it's shit.
ah.
that's jolly.
--thank you for calling--
ilene, we don't really know that.
no. no.
marla?
actually i don't
apparently it didn't help. you know about peter, of course.
dwayne put the gun down --
i know. i had to take the day to think.
yes.
i know that, lois. and i wish he were here . . .
bank branch!
print this frank.
i'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability.
because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  i'll go in the ring, and i'll announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and i'll let you win!  then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on letterman, like tiny tim did on carson... right there on the show!  what do you say???
toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. hair brown, eyes pale blue. he'd be about 35 now. he said he lived in philadelphia, but may have lied. that's really all i can remember, senator - but if i think of any more, i'll let you know.
it can't hurt you if you're not afraid aubrey.  think about us. we're here for you, we love you...
yes.
that's where he'll be.
the title won't do.
he is, i believe, a brother.
it'd be an adventure.
i doubt very much that you'd like her in 'the hairy ape'.
you go to movies at least?
soon as i get over the heart attack...
there's a little girl on board who's ill and...
me, i'm riding along, minding my own business. four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. i guess they admired my horse. she's a great one, a sweet little bay.
she looks a lot like you.
maybe you shouldn't.  don't get happy.  this changes nothing between you and me.  you did a good thing and mother sister wanted to thank you for it.
that's their explanation.  you might not believe me...
the thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
gruber...
that's not what he thinks.
well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
what is it with you? why is it so important? it's a buzz, right? like getting high.
i warned them, marie. i told them to leave us alone.
i ain't mad at you...
now, i have two rubbers.  wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  i don't want you coming so damn early.
you afraid to try?
what? when did it happen? your dad and i always expected you two to get married.
are you an fbi man?
you will be the first to pay for that mistake.
no, for god's sake, i just watered it yesterday.  it almost went well. i gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
look, he doesn't have any money... but i'll give you everything i've got.  i have a few hundred dollars.
but not flush against the tunnel?
eerie. really eerie.
they sound like you.
and the marriage - is that a fiction? 
why'd he come in our camp.
well, er... no.  i mean, you don't look like dragons i've heard of.
... well, we did do the nose.
it's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
okay, let's heat 'em up!
she ain't retarded, she's shy.
she ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
with us.
then tell him to wax it too.
ow!
do what you do to simone.
-- we can't now.
oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
you just move in here?
oh you can have it, i'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
i saw you tinkering with that contraption, hickory. now, you and hunk get back to that wagon!
said he stole his invention.
i mean, romantically.
she's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
well i, i don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
i don't know.
what theater was i at?
-- and now you're going to pee some more.
it's been so long i don't how long?
justin just tried to kill himself. the man is clearly insane.
uh, do you think these two sluts still live in highland? that would be cool.
see ya.
he doesn't. he needs nobody. but we have hunted many times...  ...he knows i am afraid of lions...
she seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. my wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
but you're not alone.
can't be that far, i say.  also, i don't like the smell of the sea around here.  smells like a cunt. bad sign...
why?
i like to watch.
no, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. they too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
yes
listen, stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
so what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
sure.
all right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. bye.
your poker's improved a lot, hildy. lend me two bucks, will you?
who the hell is this!?
no great lady will ever take my place?
tell him about baldy.
tonight. just me.
i hear things, too.  people call you the mayor of darktown.
thicker than water.
god, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
fine. i mean, it's not like i was doubting you, it's just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
what's it...
stop.
hildy -- i can't. i'm busy -- i -- let me up, hildy. earl williams has escaped --
uh-huh.
you know i wasn't drunk--i knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car--
what medicine?
no... i don't think so, man.
no.  i'm running <u>to</u>.
must've needed it.
you don't know the chicken places around where you live?  ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
like how?
what?
you stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
very serious?
harry, this is my fantasy! i suggest you leave - before i imagine something horrible.
no, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
you drooling idiot! what do you mean, you're getting out! there are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- once in a lifetime! hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
you? frighten me? that's a good one! i'm twice as fast as you are. who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
catch me later, okay?
she'll never understand it.
snuff films.
it's not bad.
it just happened. it was just this thing that happened along with everything else. can you understand that?
cobb's cut...it was in him! it got doc...
enough's enough.  how could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
we were such desperate sluts back then.
weed lowers the body temperature.  i read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
this is the one thing i like about this house... want some lox?
what should i say? you did fine work. we'll wait on the lab.
look it... i put the goddamn dress on, didn't i? i think i'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
he's a consultant to a network tv program on profilers. he gets a check every episode.
lucky girl.
it's insured.
what, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
how am i going to break this to bob hope?
it's a change.
now this i want to hear.
what do you like then?
how long were you with the girl?
stop squawking! you were doing this job on a ship four years ago when i first picked you up, weren't you?
wood's okay. i want viper.
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born. and if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
it's important.
blue is cold.
okay. just step on it. just get me home.
then let's have it.
where did you hear that, one of those american talk shows?  check, please.
i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?
don't recite the fact to me. i'm sure i know 'em better than you do.
always. always.
all of us thank you, okay?
i thought you said they needed discipline?
you ever think about going back?
that's it.
okay, sweetie.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
i'm frightened of you, bruce. i'm frightened for you.
nor have i. even though you disappeared...  but what's the point of talking about it? we risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  you still live in rome?
you couldn't pick up a phone?  i'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
no, i don't.
all right... sorry... i feel indebted to him.
i can't, i have no idea how he's doing it.  and that leaves you trailing, jim.  you gotta get your act together.
thais.
i'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols.
that's the magic number.
that girl was looking for jacqueline gibson. i'd forget it if i were you.
jesus christ, joe. fuckin' forget it. this is beneath me. i'm mr. pink, let's move on.
very....very!
philadelphia, pennsylvania.
are you going to put a spell on me?
no. the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. but basically he is, how you say, a legume.
there's something wrong with your car, you said.
it was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
ah-hah. it would be best if he waited here.
what do you mean?
sheriff, this is no time to panic.
you realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order.
let's not get too idealistic.
it was nothing.  we're not ... he just makes me laugh.  when was the last time we laughed?  any of us?
don't be so self-righteous. it's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
prove it.
hey, sisters.  are you going in there?
is she against you getting help?
maybe she knows your old man.
i mean, you're going too fast. you're hardly even looking at the pictures.
ya know, i'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, i would love to get a bigger place.
you being cynical, hennessy?
huh?
it's not gonna be easy. your brothers can possess people. so they probably won't look like themselves. you have to be suspicious of everyone.
perfect for the mission. nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
fine.  but they'll have to take care of themselves.
yes.
you haven't smoked in two years.
comin' over coldwater.  goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  you believe that?
sometimes.
in a democracy, cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. your brother's practice...
what are you then?  what will you be ten years from now?  still cutting lawns?  still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
huh?... why don't you get a haircut, buljanoff? you all look so wintry, comrades. and why do we always keep the windows closed?  isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... look at the birds. i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. now i know why. we have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, comrades, i don't think i need you any more.
i sure did, phillip!!
no, ho-jon, we're not going to open you up.
well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>i</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
oh -- now let's talk like adults. you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. when you first approached us...
they're yellow.
oh.
you're safe.  we've come to get you out of here... just relax.
...and i'm going to get bounced and you're...
exactly.  we'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  it would cause the line to buckle. then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
so i'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  you fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  there's something i want you to think about.  the book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. you tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  to what end?  you're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  go get drunk.  i am.
citizen lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  we do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
it's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
because he was a <u>real</u> hero, chucky. he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  he didn't expect the media to lionize him.  he didn't expect a million dollar reward. he saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante....  for how much, laplante?  a couple of bucks?  did you give him enough for a decent meal?
you get out of here! if any of you men think you can come busting in here-
data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise. command codes, security protocols...
nothing else?
they have a right to know. howard is a thief. he steals the truth.  i can't remember my baby! i can't remember my baby. it existed and i can't even remember. do you understand that?
there's nothing wrong with me!
no.
it is for me.
no.
just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. i have a long trip ahead of me.  how far are you going? on the train, i mean, of course.
the creator of what?
look at them, lieutenant. everybody is a clown! how do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?

okay.
thank you.  and always smile.
john, sooner or later -- sooner, i think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to richard nixon.  that he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  and eventually, it's either you or him. look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
of course he does. now get the key, get these things off me.  unhook me.
i've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.

...like you?
are you for real?
but there're so many wonderful things to write about, bob.
i found him.
you want company?
you need the words?
really?  she didn't mention it.
that feller last night, that's who! he was gonna stay a week, huh? well, he's skipped. took the car with him, too. we wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if i hadn't took that magnesia.  come on, get up, don't lay there. let's do something about it.
so they tell me...
this time, swana -- just this once -- i must ask you to listen.

you've got to help me to remain faithful.
cold.
proximo, we need to talk about my one third... i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. and, what was the name of that olive oil company?
it sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. and since all it is is a drop, the welshman's got nothing at stake. i say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. it'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
got a pencil?
you like me, huh?
alright?
baby, i'm sorry. i feel terrible. i'd stay and talk but i'm so late. look, don't be upset. we'll talk when i get home. see you around midnight.  bye. and don't brood. watch t.v. or something.

and i'm sorry for you, too, sidney. you're going down with the ship.
v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator.
buy some.
i'm her father -- supposed to be, but i'm not able to. yes. yes, i am. it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting. even if it takes a big fight.
what did you call me, boy?
eastern europe.  like what?  romania? hungary?
maybe eve can guess.  she's psychic.
i said i'll take care of it. now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. so go home and i'll call you tomorrow.
and what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
first of all, doug, when you go rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the hilton; plus all the major sights:  mount pyramid, the grand canals, and of course...  venusville.
hey, amigo, come chow with me.
stop it!

twenty... but i was down at least fifty. i'm sorry, i got hot at the crap table.
well before there was black or african american, there were negroes.  i'm a negro.
sorry, sweetheart. bein' in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side.
i don't know. i feel overmatched.
to me he seems rather nervous.
wild, ain't it?!  see, we exist on a higher plane, you and i.  we make our own rules.  why be a servant of the law johnny u... when you can be it's master?
i'm afraid i can't give you an ans- wer to that, mr goodridge. as i ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..

i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
they can look forward to that.
so what do i get in return?
no, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
all of 'em.
ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
do you think she's prettier than i?
zero risk.
the indians, injuns, whatever. they're always drunk and doing stupid things.
you have one?
what'd he look like?
and you're all alone.
run.  take that girl and start running.  run and don't look back. all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by.  this time run and don't look back and call it living.  live every second, live it right up to the hilt.  live, wyatt...  live for me.
you're... limping.
man, how many girls do you need?
you know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
the plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.

where to?
yes...
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
yeah.  who are you?
i'm sure. you've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
did you learn anything?
there's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
what?
you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?

and what am i supposed to do?  just sit here and watch them coming closer? eating their way to the center?  lyndon bugged!  so did kennedy!  fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano. christ, even ike had a mistress! what's so special about me?  what about lyndon?  he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down.  did anyone talk to him?
no. got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. figure between that and my night work at the bodwins i might be able to put something away for me and mama.
you're new to charenton, yes? perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
it's not that easy.  maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  i can't. i don't want to be alone.  i need to know i'm going to be taken care of.
yes?
when i'm good and ready.
you were with him?
go ahead.
aren't you coming?
it's complicated, but [looking at starks] in a way, your father let me know how i'd get through to him.
who, me? why should it?
yes. i didn't plan it that way.
then relax.  it's a federal bank. guaranteed by the government.  and senor noriega has very lenient banking principles.  no questions.  no problems. all the pesados keep their money here. even el padrino.  what do you worry? everyone knows we are with escobar.  who is going to fuck with us?

baker.  jack baker.
this babe has said enough.
why?
like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  fingers rotting off?
you promised you'd do the show.
that's your answer to everything, dude.  and let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
hello, roper. glad you could join us.
no!
what did you expect, lieutenant?
sounds good.
stay!
don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  the important thing, doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.

you said in l.a., anything goes.
yup.
we have that taken care of.  you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. no one, you hear?

no such luck.  i saw it running down one of the corridors.
cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

i think we may be, yes.
sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
oh... this and that.

what i can't get out of my mind is the image of rene- my nephew. i just can't believe he's gone.
well...
but, indy --
i didn't think she'd dare come back to peking!
it doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -

but you knew about this.
goodnight, miles.
yes. how did you know it was me?
yes. it is today.
it puzzles me so badly. i've done terrible things but i can't consider myself a terrible man. i've killed three people and i'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
have fun.
'i'll be in the bedroom.'
i know.
all right, mr. pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. here!  go to this address. it's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. just tell 'em fred sent you. and here's fifty dollars on account.
he lost all the weight... there.
you saw a lot in one night.
they left. i had to go with them.
ah! my lady! the tide waits for no man, but i swear it would wait for you!
the readings suck....
well, sir, plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
why?  i just read your report card.  what's the point?  stay home, watch some television, we'll get "mad" magazine delivered.  what kind of report card do you call this?!
was ever a man more risquè? he wants to take me every way!
is that far from here?
[beat] yeah, it is.
why selfish?
ah, forget it, kid. i want you to pull this out of your head. if that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, i will. i respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
i don't think so.
joey, joey...
he raped a <u>nun</u>...
oh--what's the point, bud?
and he's a patient of yours?
thta's not charlie's work --
certainly not, but i knew he had informers everywhere. even in my orchestra there was someone
you're the one who started it.
i know.
he's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay! they're going to be shooting at him!
time's running out...but i'm obliged to you.
be careful!
i can't fly it.
pretty darn good, ya want some?
it was a hate crime.
i don't know...
not at all.  my name is merrick.  i was sent to find you some time ago. i should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. you should have been taught, prepared.
they'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
can we go on living here otherwise?
no, we're not.  jack?
what does that mean?
i'm on top of it.  if there's a problem --
that's what you said the other night.
your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, wally.
there's always a surprise.
no. that's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. you don't even know who you are. you're nothing. less than nothing. a zero. who are you?
means what it says. the scorpion does what is in his nature. take off the hood, man.
what?
really?
i don't suppose... no...
with the money.
can i help you?
that guy was hurtin' me.  and if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  and they woulda made out like i asked for it.  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  at least now i'm havin' fun.  and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  and if i haven't, i wanna take this time to thank you, louise.  thank you for savin' my ass.
well, he offered, and i just couldn't refuse. his car overheated.
you american?
you've been the man in mine.
i'm just in one of my moods. you know how i get.
i can't say he's been all that effective with her.
i'm staying here.
nothing. we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
primary trigger switch.
nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
we're not even sure what it was.
duh. the cool kids sit in the back of the bus. here, every row is in the back. we're all cool!
what a mess.
we better get it into the box. come on...
oh, pretty good.
yes, sir.
you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
i'll play you.
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, brian. this could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  so if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a section eight, do you tell your men?  of course not.  you bluff, you lie.
how do they know?
if you want me to hate her i will.
wait a minute! our problems might be solved.
on that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "unknown entry event." they didn't know what a black hole was.  fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
yes?
you said they would be here!
i don't know.
oh, don't worry about that ... tell me ... doesn't camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
just in case i don't have a chance to say goodbye, i want you to know that i haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
no, no. i want to go in.
apparently, mr. wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. she said he would like it if i wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "american."
the ship needs its captain.
hey—you're little, aren't you?
ew. . .  the honest type.
and you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  it's no big deal, betty.
you still didn't have to choke me.
ben, jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on watergate? where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
sorry!  it's kind of a ride!
so what's wrong with her?
it's because i wanted to keep you away from that world.
<u>computer off</u>!
i do not want those cigarettes.
hey, i read the papers, i watch 60 minutes, i say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. they want something.  now, personally, i don't care about your politics. maybe you're pissed at the camel jockeys, maybe it's the hebes, northern ireland, that's none of my business.  i figure, you're here to negotiate, am i right?
the um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. if that's all...
you didn't visit him in prison.
you rented an automated litter box.
okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
you've seen her!...she's alive?
nurse! oh god! alex!
no, of course not, silly -- i mean felt like this about them?
tommy reina.
you're on the grift. same as me.
say something.
i've never understood that.  it's just... getting dark.  but i like you!  hey!  why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to tijuana, and get married???
we'll get you home, frances.
well, what do you think i'm going to do? quit in protest? i'm not going to do that.
he took my driver's license, john, he knows where we live.
it is not that i care for <u>you</u>--but that i posses an enquiring mind.  what will you <u>do</u> when i am gone?  when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
what now?
yes!
yes. it's very cold outside today, isn't it, thomas?
i listened extra careful to your "stand to" this mornin', boy. ft was peifecl i couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when i was bugler to the duke of wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
there are people down there having fun. i want to be one of them. i want you to be one of them. on monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of puerto rican rum and a fistful of cash.
no, you're shielding her. let her face the world.
not even a guess?
no... i have a... room... at the hotel de perrin.
i'll be right back.
"'why?  why don't i get the opportunities...?"
and i don't try to touch her. you know, in a bad way. foolin' around, sex and all.
not the bible?
...i know, i'm so...because i said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  please don't go.  please don't go.  what can i do but beseech you...?  trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  when...?
i can appreciate what your majesty is saying but the emperor has staked everything on this policy.  he has no other way to attack england, and no one knows more than your majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
he's doing the best he can, charles.
it is safer there. i will join you shortly.
tell him i'm out. no, tell him i've passed away. an old war wound or something. tell him i'm dead. and no more calls!
listen...i'm a guest here.
he's a guest in my house, isn't he?
boy did i get sick of rabbit. but later on after momma died and daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. you know, i oughtn't to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child. until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, buddy.
sure, as soon as we eat.
elizabeth!?!  'can't waits any longer.  arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' oh, god!  not tonight.
very much.
like what... my favorite color... ?
now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. sid is going to evolve.
you pull a muscle or something?
what are you doing there? haven't you even started?
we don't have time to argue, susan.
are you recording it?
i'm a psychologist, frank... not a psychic.  what's this all about anyway?
oh, i wouldn't know that, sir.
that would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, will?
two. one ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the getty museum...
you went to see mrs. redi... she told you something -- what was it?
right as rain.
a little basic, but nice.
fish, i'm really sorry. i just...i owe you man.  desert.
you've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
no. that was the point.
this is how we fill up our lives.
yeah, as a matter of fact they did. come on in.
oh, god.
did you try to switch to transponder channels?
the truth is, i'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
i'm drinking.
thank you, mr. leibel. thank you very much.
these are ich luge bullets. my grandfather snared a shitload of them in w.w. two. they're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
he's all right.
a page-break signal.  a period.
give me a fucking.....
twenty dollars is a lot of money. are you sure you can trust me with it? i mean, aren't you afraid i might steal it?
everything you couldn't.
it's not ours to decide. all that live must die. it's god's will.
heh heh. we wanna do her now!
no!
go, mr. sulu.
hey, stop by the shop.
but my head...
out there is a perfect engine, an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. look at that! those proportions are correct.  i know sharks.
shhh...
and?
well why do i care about that?
mr. sulu?
yes, i'm very clean.  did they find anything at my apartment?
you know what i'm doing with my half?
hos qordu. 
well, at any rate, i would like to say goodbye to the girl.
not if you don't grow up...
well... uh... yes ma'am. for the time being.
just for luck.
there it is. better swallow it. we're not going to have any breakfast.
let some of us come down there.
how did your speech go?
did your wife find out?
he's a podiatrist.  pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
a drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  a man's got to protect his home.  his wife.  you're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
i didn't even see them fire!
you're so romantic...
i want to keep my teeth.
79 kilos.
bastards took off, though, didn't they?
no?
i know god help me, i know that, eli.  but i tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for samuel.
shut up.
that's what i'm thinking, rita. maybe...
sit your suspect out in the cold. he'll keep.
-- not yet --
i'm going to leave now. do you want a lift?
if that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
you need that real often?
oh my gosh, here it is!
run!
you do?
let me speak to mr. smith.  i want to hear it from him.
i know, right?
get out of there now!
where you married?
is it wednesday?  it's wednesday. how embarrassing.  i don't know what i was thinking.  with all the excitement lately...  am i interrupting something?  are you expecting company?
she didn't want any help.
what year?
no problem, man.  hey, you wanna hit?
yeah...
naw. it don't feel too good but it's alright.
you have to leave the white house.
that bitch.  what's keeping you from taking off?
nope.
yes.
aah!
i dunno, must be a king.
i beg your pardon?
what? he's in sicily!
hi.  good lord -- you're the spitting image of...
what happened?
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
they didn't give you a choice, did they?
sidney, i know you by now.  don't do a dance with me...
is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
can i sit down?
i've got be here for the police when they come.  then i've got to practise. in case you forgot i'm in the middle of a match right now.
what's with you?
who are you?
sorry, sir. the cult is my life and my life is the cult. by god, captain god, i shall not fail you..
that was a misunderstanding.
doll, don't ask childish questions.
better than not getting a job?
dude's a half--squid. ain't many places he can hide. sea world, maybe.
no... no. it is just the english way.
a real mamma's boy that one. dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. little good it did him.
what are your rates?
my father's .600 nitro express.  made in 1904.  karimojo bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
what they like then?
it's from an ira.
did you see him?  do you know who he is?
i could be mentoring kramer. kramer clerked for scalia.
yes ma'am, i do.
so what are you doing tonight, jack?
mrs. thorwald.
how did you get this gig?
oh ma, they're not using me. it's just a chance to travel, see things. besides, it's the only way i can get to new york.
i swear.  on my life.
if we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
you're impressed with her, aren't you?
...i saw nothing.
when was this?
i thought you'd be happy for me. after all, you --
uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
i said i would...
is she injured?
but this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
boyfriend?
large scotch.
i'm exhausted.
nowt.
yes, mr. preysing -- that's what we want to know.
it seems i am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time i am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
yeah... that must have been it.
what happened?
good evening, mrs. cook.
the what!
i bring her flowers too.
and so now you're off to glades.
okay, good tip.
yeah?
hey, who?
yeah. i'm thinking about micheal's franco harris fixation. you know how micheal was always harping "immaculate reception?" i've seen that play. a lot of times...and i have to say this... franco was lucky. flat out, right place, right time. that's it. he was where the ball bounced. you get me?
... it's very bizarre - i don't know what to think...
those are the words of a broken spirit.  my spirit is whole.  i have trusted d'artagnan with my deepest secrets, and i will never believe he is my enemy.
i want an hour with him.
i'll call you tomorrow.
what?
back on earth. victor's medical facility... we're in quarantine.
certain ladies make that very easy... vivian.  john, call a limousine for our guest, please.  have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  bill the hotel.  see you again sometime soon.
in the words of my private investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
do i know everything there is to know here?  you fellas aren't talking with bob sugar, are you?
as much as anybody else is, i guess. y'all have a good rest of the day now.
what?
yes.
and if you can't deliver them?
let my kid go.
not one i should like to rely on. francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
he is?
they gone to the field...
move aside. this is the king's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
not tonight.
i already got it.  everything i want.
'course i do -- i deliver money for him.
go to hell.
fuck you.  this is bullshit.  i'm outta here.
it's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean, shell oil and everything -
it should, but i found it and now i claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  seize the cave.
oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
i'll schedule the launch.  call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
i can't afford slack, brigman.
yeah, i guess so.  what are you going to do now that you're home?
memory is no trick, it is a power. the power to see.
no. you baked them for whitey.
you loved your wife, surely.
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask.  your husband... he committed suicide?
what... what are you talking about?
no, i'm sorry. i should've made an appointment.  was that anything important?
look, i know it's been frightening, i know your dreams have seemed real. but... it's okay. okay?
it didn't go anywhere.  but that's not why --
tonic will be fine.
okay.
can't we take it off?
so what are you up to today, miles?
but it's breakfast for supper. your favorite, paulie. i made french toast and sausage. patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
hello, sam, this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america.
no -- that's true. the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself!
you got me. this is a crazy town, emmett. i think we ought to get out of here.
no - not at all. i couldn't sleep either.
i used to think he was something, once...  i was eighteen, i didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
now listen, if i had any information, i wouldn't have come here to ask you. but i see that you, too, lack any information ...
it looks like it.
i hate you because you depart without kissing me. that's all.
not especially.
got the ring. got the airline tickets. soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
right here, woody!
i'll never forget you as long as i live, sergeant.
yes, i think so, it is still barred, but it is not the university who are in the building.
buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
migrants?
that's the rock star thing.
so who's he?
mommy?
so graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two i'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
it's not me i'm worried about...you know darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. you owe me, i want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  stop me if i'm going too far.
i ain't fuckin' sure, bobby.
what? that's disgusting!
smith.  carl smith.
drunk-rolling job.  they hit him too hard.
all right.  it's a beginning.  las vegas, nevada.
braces.
that's because it's such a nice one.
no.
that what you think?
you once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  that sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  do you remember?
just the way the world works.  look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know.
are you discussing gamebirds now? all birds are not gamebirds, you know.
don't remind me. that's how we happened to --
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.
we did not.
so now you're saying my mother trapped you?
yes.
good.
give away food?
listen, i think i'm hit bad.
excuse me!  you went to a party with her?
what if frank came over here and found us?
the superintendent met thorwald coming back. he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
come on, alice.
lieutenant thomas wickwire.
messina.
noireuter.
forget it, just go take care of her.
we just got a bomb threat upstairs.
this is some crazy shit, man!
man, what's this about? ya know, you were robbing a store. it wasn't personal. it was his job.
well, does it make sense to you?
skywire.
see here, can you understand english! i don't want it reported!  please stay out of my affairs!  i want to be left alone.  a close-up of peter shows him glaring after her.
urdu and hindi.
... had regenerated.
a wife?
jesus, that's in chinatown, ain't it?
control on.
sure, boss.
good idea.  flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
she says that ali is still in the casbah.
albert, why tylenol?
my best friend. my very best friend.
did you know my mother died recently?
got a shovel?
i like it fine here.
are you a spirit too?
you are out of control. heather and kurt were a shock, but martha dumptruck, get crucial! she dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
hey, sport. how are things?
you know how i feel.  the world is random.  the only certainty i believe in is death.
i'm afraid that's not up to me.
so i have to have a motive to be with you?
or in my chiffonier. i don't know.
oh, no, man, look. look, you know, it's me, okay? i come out here and i'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and i think i'm a fucking star, man, and i'm really sorry if i'm full of attitude. i, i really...
i've changed my mind. i'll come to moscow. if you -- are still going --
what was that?
what makes you think i was the last one?
five years ago, i was at the party, remember?
i think she covered you with the parasites.
no --
give it everything we've got!
yes.
wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
you're still asking me to break the law.
premature ejaculation.
so that's what this is all about.  we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
take a look, harold. tell me if you see anything you want. you do like to look, don't you?
he always shows up when somebody's in danger.
with the one thirty second under perry, from '21 to '27--
why can't we have pumpkins for christmas, too? we don't get any good presents at christmas, anyway.
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
in the building ...  mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the patrolman.
if you don't want to do it this way, i can remove it surgically.
but what i get scared again?
all he could think about was getting to you. there's still love there i think.
yeah. knocked around for a couple of months after the army. you been there?
thanks, binky.  can you see bromdingna island yet?
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy.
you sure?
it's just going to take a while.
why not?
well, cohaagen, i have to hand it to you...this is the best mindfuck yet.
are you a lawyer?
you heard me, jesse. you know how crazy i get!
you know you almost got us both killed back there?
i don't want someone who'll put up with him. i want someone who will enjoy him, the way i do. do you know what he told my friend tucker? he said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if warren wasn't in my life.  well he is in my life and i'm goddamn lucky to have him. the hell with steve.
sweet.
he won't give it to me.
i like--really need a cigarette, too.
my old man split along time ago.  it doesn't mean anything.  you just take care of number one that's all that matters.
no, you're not really getting married?
no it's not. guys name their penises.
you are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  that was my misfortune.  that was your misfortune.  i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was.  i had no choice.
i loved it. it sounds peculiar, but i loved every minute of it. i did. eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me. a little part of his soul inside me. i could feel it. it was alive and kicking.
well, one day i'm invited skiing, the next day i'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. you tell me.
pot is an herb. it's just like any type of gardening.
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
we'll know in forty seconds.  only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
i don't know...
my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. know why it's best to rotate em like that?
you're not crazy. don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  this time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  the moment when contact becomes possible.  we've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
what else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
how?
the ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. when it  reaches the core, we're done.
kalen... hold on a minute.
i don't want you to think that i'm a drinker. i can stop any time i want to - only i don't want to.  especially when i'm blue.
he does work hard.
nope. no complaints.
kill him when he gets down.
diane, i do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  i see you so seldom, i'd really rather know about you.
you are the dumbest person in the world.
nothing.
yeah.
oh don't worry kid, i know where you live.  now i want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy yahoo. you got that space cowboy.  y-a-h-o-o. it's a magic word and i never want you to forget it.
because it means the tree is older than the house.
i stay on my feet all the time at work. i just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
but you don't?
i have a message for you; i love you.  may i dedicate the next number to you?...and the next, and the next. every sunday i'll buy you a new bonnet -
can't break tradition. it's bad luck.
what?
ah. wait a minute. the university must know where he lives.
that's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
so whoever did this might still be around.
afternoon.
no.  i see them.
you think be's pretty nice, don't you?
i don’t know. everyone’s dead...
covered.
greetings fellow insomniac.
it should all in the report. i told you guys everything. she was giving birth in the fucking car. she grabbed the wheel and i lost control.
the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
the one time i want it to work...
i'll just tell my wife.
he's staying with a friend.  hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
last two like this we had, you caught.
what? where?!
shhh!  come on.  tell us something!
about what!
you're a sweet man, richard.
uhura, you did what was necessary.  keep trying. you'll find him...
i'm not telling you.
not at all.
why?
i have nothing to reproach myself for. all i know is that i've changed. with all my strength, which is not much, i will follow the road that the lord has shown me. one can also serve outside a convent.
you loved him.
i can't believe they decided you won.
kelly, could you look after sean for a while?  show him around for me?
it's okay--i don't mind.
yeah. it's been twenty-seven years.
our last game is this saturday.
this kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. but it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. and even worse the kid is good at it. i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
well, i see the yankees finally won a game.
how tall are you?
it's like this, wayne. two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. these two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
not a dent.  perfect
all i said was that it sounds like a good idea.
that's what i said.
uh-huh.
who did this to you?
the police?  we'd never live to testify. not against spats colombo.  wabash 1098.
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. that's why i'm marrying him.
don't worry, i can get rid of this. no trace. and i'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
don't be stupid, larry.  if he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
they're drifting toward me... i think they're magnetic!...
so what makes you so special?
and they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. you know why? all they eat is seafood.
nope. i think the man is a liar.
what are you asking me for? he's so busy lately i hardly see him. and he's been so preoccupied.
we were idealists.
he was a crooked bastard.  he would have killed us.
sure.  for five bucks.
oh -- where do you come from?
where is he? where have you got him hid?  ah, ha!
yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
you mean a picture?
correct.
yes... i...
why not just buy your baby a night light?
oh, i see.  but you're not luke. you're peter appleton, the picture writer.
i'm not running a charity ward...
well of course i'm sure. i'd tell you. christ, i don't even smoke grass.
it is cocktail hour yet?
what does this matter to you?
still sleeping.
with them?
but <u>we're</u> the focus, right reed? <u>reed</u>...?
what happened?
probably herring gulls. they arrive in november, you know, and don't migrate north again until march or...
i think i'll be all right to come with you, sir.
who's in command?
what are you talking about?
yes, sir.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a yale education... and the right tailor.
no.
he's only doing what you told him to.
it's just impossible.
i like it.
don't we always take good care of you?
i'll bloody well ask him.
yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. probably is one of the boys, if you know what i mean.
did you know that?
...so i, so i like that.  i always like an underconfident person...
keep going.
further... what are you talking about, air?  that makes no sense-- i hold three cadet class records--
it smells funny. like gasoline.
he's not here.
it takes years to get there. and years to come back...now go to bed, toto, it's late.
i mean, what are you actually doing here? what is the hidden agenda?
it's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
hang on, burt.  the bastards are up to something.
a rest?
gum thought brazil.
oh, you were talking to jesse.
i've given up angles for awhile. i just want to solve this thing.
and fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
rescued at last.
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you're what i want.
-- no, no, no, don't even.  i talked to laura, rob.  i talked to her and she gave me a little background. and you're a fucking asshole.
hey...hey!
after i broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank god they didn't catch me! -- i just drove around. trying to figure out what possessed me. you know what? i've been putting my own guilt on gary.
but, i mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  i mean, you shoulda heard her there.  tellin' her whole story...i believed her.
why not.
ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
okay, well that about covers it.
nothing.
don't mention it - now can i get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
yeah, well --
you reached down into death.  now, isn't that right?
john ultramalensky?
bruce. son. listen to me. you are a kind man. a strong man. but in truth you are not the most sane man.
uncle al-
dan'l webster is coming to my party.
we've already done this.
let's get cleaned up, kyle.
where?
what if they do question the authenticity?
heat is heat.
i love you.
hello, violet.
well, the line of the jacket -- no really....just very nice...just right. i wish i could be there.
just wait a second. wait one second. okay. what are you doing?
the drugstore's closed?  what the hell time is it?
you sure about all this?
what?
i'll wait.
i must get into that country of yours!
it was like some big fucking secret!
no, i'm not...
that's my point. remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. it's not the other way around.
oh thank god. maybe this whole thing is really over.
hmm.  those sound kind of small.  oh, here's one that looks good: janet lawton.  i'd sure like to play her.
i swear to god i had nothing to do with it ...
i didn't want to see you. i mean, i did...but i didn't..
this... is my new home?
no, dad.  i don't want to...i mean, i just don't want...
you want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
just don't fucking tell her.
you don't mean it. it's just for show.
i'm pretty good at signatures myself.
and what do you want out of this?
so what?  so what?  for starters, how about littering is a crime.
gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. we can rule that out.
we're through!
laughlin. he's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
no, it's...
just wait, you'll see.
alright.
and lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  they can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. air police will have lists of all owners.
where's your missus?
not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
- any more than being the son of captain neilsen does!
no, i couldn't.
information.
turn around quick!
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
what kind of good memories, max? your mother and father fighting all the time.
they turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. said i was well.
just in love with everybody. it's really a beautiful planet. i love you, rick. i love you guys. i love everybody.
will he understand spanish?
all right. all right. i just cleaned b-8. give me a break.
shut yo' ass up.
great news.
what chip?
how come you're alone on new year's eve?
i lose 'em all, that's why i'm still out here on this rock.  anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
he owes me money.
you ever play chicken?
i never said that.
that's disgustin'. those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. is this biloxi yet?
...i missed two-face by a heartbeat. when we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
no.  no.  mom wants you to come to the funeral.  it's on friday.
what?
-- i've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  but i have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
great
yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
wanna hear something more impressive? my first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. my girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the olympic. says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
where are you going...?  this is me...this is ricky, jim.  jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  you understand?  this is me.  something upset you.  sit down, now sit down.  you tell me what it is.  am i going to help you fix it? you're goddamned right i am.  sit down.  tell you something...? sometimes we need someone from outside.  it's...no, sit down...now talk to me.
they're jammed!
what?  you talked to him!  did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
......and this is confidential?
please, yes.
for the princess?
what?
maybe you better hear what i got to say first.
hi, ted.
look doctor, i don't know how to tell you this politely, but i don't approve of you. not you personally...
i bet good housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
louder.  they can't hear you.
sorry. i just --
mr. cole... not only am i a teacher... but i am also a parent of a middlesex child. therefore, i am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
rejected, worthless, miserable.
i say let's keep it the way it is.
trask wants to talk with you.
you didn't think i could just leave you?
okay, i'm goin'. you'll see. i'll get you.
but...i...400 years?
i didn't say that.  all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out.
vampires. we thrive on blood.
you make any sandwiches?
it's not true.
i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
listen, i'll... see you again.
okay, i'll give here the message.
and we're very grateful.
ok.  that's why.  i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla. your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
they were performance pieces.
if only i could have been with you.
come around to three-three-four...
when you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. you guessed but you didn't know.
the killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
maybe, who knows?  you know how voices are.  let's go.
you betcha.
why didn't you fade?
yes you did.
my name is sir robin of camelot!
scare me?  no, actually, i was just scaring myself ...
father!
that's what i thought until you came riding in.  i saw your car over at the gas station.  it's a cool car.  want to take me for a ride?  desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
you're sure? there's lots more.
yes. and i've accepted.
no prob...
close.
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
right, the gym.
probably a year...
you could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. i told you i have a girlfriend.
i was in a german concentration camp for a year. that's honor enough for a lifetime.
i don't know, shit.  maybe she was looking for love...
yes, i will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
all right.  i'll do it.  i'll do it.
un-hunh.
of course he is -- the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  people disappear up there regularly.   if you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
i'm a rosicrucian myself.
you're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
darling emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the prospero project ...
where is your farm?
it's a 27b/6 of course.
oh man, what the hell happened?
good god.
yes, my master.
it was right there on top. isn't she pretty?
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve.
c'mon, chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. i'm not taking notes ..
waters? what waters? we're in the desert.
something you did?
western europe.
and now jonathan masbath.
swear to god, i need to know the truth.
fine with me.
billy, that's brilliant!
when?
please!
it does.
nothing.
ever since i was a little boy, i remember hearing about the family line. the picards that fought at trafalgar, the picards that settled the first martian colony. when my brother married and had a son...
better.
i brought it to you in the hospital.
i don't believe it!
you were attracted to me?
okay. my secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. tell me are you worried about that girl, or what evelyn might do to her?
what time was this?
fine.
in the private aircraft hangar. anybody could have walked in.
my bed was shaking, i can't get to sleep.
maybe. i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
okay.
five seconds.
yeah. you know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. that's how they met.
and then --?
hell, you're the district attorney. you read the warren report - and then you tell me you're satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome.
it's simple.  what was your pal louis' first musical instrument?
no.
what do you do?
my tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
tell me where is jack foley, i don't bother you no more.
just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  sheila and kastle sit up.
just the name of this hospital, st. severin. he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
because i'd met someone else.
i only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but marguerite could not help me.  nor julien...
annabelle pick up the phone.
then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
there's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. free for the hauling! we should put it in bleeker's yard.
kristen got a quote?
shit, that's what keeps people alive.
and then sunday?
oh?
of course i was.  i'd read all your papers on bioethics.  some of them two times just so i'd have something to say to you.
investment banking.  moving money from place to place.
yes, you are free to go, karel here will drive you home.
don't forget to open it for me.  i can't be opening my own bottle.
from what?
what's it look like?  we're going in.
yeah, thanks. we appreciate that.
oh, right.  alright.
who are they?
this won't wait until tomorrow, venkman. it's hot and it's ready to pop.
wow, you can't buy this kind of publicity!
have any other people ever passed through?
yeah!
venkman?  i think he was borderline for a while there.  then he crossed the border.
little bill? he didn't say nothing. like i said, he was buildin' his porch. have you seen that thing?
no, sir. i was empathizing. sorry.
ah.
that's right, take his part. you're his brother. he's never gonna be champ. too many people are against him.
i...
it's not me, it's dark here... and i can't find the switch.
i expected no less, captain.
ahi, ahi, cazzo!  ma mamia! where...?  god, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
sure.
meet me at three.
she can't help it.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a milit&ry prison... 
every time i think of it, i get a laugh, diz.
keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
well, no... not just, not only.
cards for sorrow, cards for pain.
i came to get you! what do you think?
horseshit.  nothing's impossible.
how about me getting the help. she's quiet now, isn't she?
yeah.  nov i know it looks normal, but watch this.
in the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are g-o-n-e and you are f-r-e-e. now, i know i put you guys through hell, and i know i've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. scotty, help me pick richie up, and lay him down. jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "digayo." when you get to digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "the titty twister." from what i hear, you can't miss it.
there'll be time for that.
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
make it the way i always do.
why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
alright, johnson, thank you.  so...what are you wearing?
general bonaparte?
none of your business.
more like thirty.
exactly.
just be friendly and say "no comment."
lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. like the little kurth boy, like domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
get me a couple juicy pictures. somethin' i can wise the rabbit up with.
i heard you, ma.
hector.
they did it... they assimilated earth.
that was the order, mr. sulu: clear the bridge.
you said go between them!
lillian says it once a week. `why doesn't he come live with us?'
i wonder -  you put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
separate bathrooms, darling. i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
oil can....
it's a lot more stressful than i thought.
ok. bye.
what have you left for me?
you think so, eh? which comes first, l or... glooph?
and --?
go for it.
they knew we were coming.  golitsynís dead too.  the disk is gone.
that needle ain't pointing north!
no, i'm going ho --
about two hundred yards from the bridge.
thanks.
exactly.
what happened? how far did you get?
well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? like audrey hepburn.
majesty.
but i'm having a good time...
she never particularly cared for me.
sure, gino, sure.
what's happening to you, frank? you're acting like you're on trial here.  this has become personal to you.
i'm not waiting until it's too late.
you weren't in the state legislature.
int. darlene's store - day.
ok, i bite. what does it look like?
and some things should never fucking happen!
looks like we came a long way for nothing.
whooee!
humor me with specifics.
there you go again! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument?
oh.  does that make you sad? or anxious? i'm always anxious thinking i'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? taking advantage of every possibility? just making sure that i'm not wasting one second of the little time i have.
angela, i just heard sal was alive.
course it's pete! look at 'im!
thanks.
i am ethel, sir, the pirate's daughter.
i'll give ya ten.
bye.
<u>this is ceti alpha v</u>! ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here. the shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>admiral</u> kirk never bothered to check on our progress. it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! on earth, two hundred years ago, i was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails.
no. it's all right. i'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
right. you can't sleep here.
it looks so soft.
all right.  all right.
totally.
c'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
if...  if... when we get to san francisco...  if they're already there?
a friend from school.
come on, boy, come on, darlin'. you kin do her. just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. stay loose, buddy. eight more, between you and everlasting glory. little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
well, he has to rule out certain things. 
probably the world's largest <u>reader's</u> <u>digest</u> collection!  c'mon, let's have some chablis, otho, i'm laid bare by this experience.  entirely bare.
uh, fontella's
this school's never had one before. i'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
f-f-fuck you.
are you sure they're your friends?
we haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
the music? or the fire?
i'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
ah, they just don't know you the way i do.
a piece of shrapnel hit me.
look, she wasn't a relative, okay? i don't know who she is.
i handle most of cardiff giant's stuff.
what?
is that a problem?
congratulations.  you're still my agent.
what is it?
it is over.
yes?
he was just here!
around...
well, what happened to you?
friday night at city hall. got a great chance to frighten the fat.
you really think we were set up?
far cry from new york.
he's my angel.
ssshhh!  we say op.  covert					* operation.  and this one got a little rough.
no.  i'm...  i don't know if we can do this without charles.
i'll be on board by noon.
i asked you to be nice to him.
look, i don't know, kent. . . clark  personally, i think it could be a terrific story!
hello, baby.
ah mom, you're embarrass'n me.
you followed me!
i certainly sympathize with your problem, treves... why don't you try the british home, or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
oh, yeah. i'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
it's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
would you mind if rudolf had a look too?
and i said i would never leave you.
see. it's four in the morning. a walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
bye.
what's gotten into you, babe? i remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let cobb get away with a thing like this.
son, don't --
and he's fine, girl.
he'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
no.  not yet.  not for about forty years.
must have opened while i was away at school.
what?
doesn't matter. i... i don't want to come back, that's all.
i knew that voice sounded familiar.  what's up?  how's it going?
dancing.
more to the point, why am i here? what did you want with me?  what does one say to one's maker, having finally met him face to face? milton gave it voice.  did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me?
for  god's sake -- go on!  are you trying to make me look like a fool. sing, you amateur!  sing!!
no, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. allah has given you a great gift. use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while he is all.
it's bullshit.  you know it is.
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
what do you care? suppose i was pregnant. just suppose it. you don't think i'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter.
what if it's beyond science? what it it's god?
i supposed you'd like a leg. how about two?
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god. he did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
oh, yes.
maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. we'll try combinations of those letters...
there's nothing we can do.  it's out of our hands.
yes, but important people are concerned about this. judge hillier spoke to alma styles --
because you're an idiot.
go on to the next question.
then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  all right?!
not yet. listen, norman, i want...
gotta check up on my boys.  hey, what's with the food?  some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'canapes,' he says.  i say, 'can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or i'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
if we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
but i can't even see her. she doesn't have her own phone, i don't even know her e-mail address.
that's right.
what's mezzaluna?
how did she get that idea?
very accommodating well, no, sir, i'm sure ...
russian, i think. i don't know.
some charts. a crew manifest.  looks like her last voyage was january 1953. the question is where the hell's she been since.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and i don't know if they're going down -- i can't see inside his mouth anymore -- i'm up all night staring at him and i don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
who?  oh.  my friend.  my friend is laura.  a girl.  a friend who's a girl.
we must speak again, mr. gardiner, many times!
nobody ever sees me.
yeah.
step up here!
well?
then what am i doing here?
the fitting room. there's a sign over the door.
it's just a feeling.  don't you sense it, too?
kill them! kill them!
just so i understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  or is it actually being an idiot?  besides--
i don't know... it just wasn't like him.
huh?
no, i mean the ones there. behind the counter.
thank you, eve.
no. exotic.
i do not accept.
and harems ... ?
cash.
what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
give me the keys...
it is the name of my father... and his father before me.
i've read it; i'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  as a heavy investor, i'm pleased.  how did the doctor find you?
all i have to do is grab my suitcase, and i'm ready. you're lucky cause i happen to love night drivin'.
you're shittin' me.  you know the beach boys?!
uh, hold on...
yeah.
yes you can.
all dead except one, sir.
funny.  i never did.
what makes you say that?
section 13?
well you're probably right about that. it certainly can't help sister agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
go out and plug the cord back in.
you're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. and you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  but it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, mister worf.
just following doctor's orders. i've decided to become a mensch. you know what that means? a human being.
oh, it was.
there's some weird shit here.
it's six-thirty ...
mind if i time you?  what do i get if you're wrong?  a free ride?
okay. thanks a lot, linda.
i'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
same as everyone else.
right. the sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
and i never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing but this is serious competition.
no stop where he's all besieged.
no. i'm glad i'm home.
no, this one was worse... i had to have the place sprayed when he left. twice... he was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which i'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, i'm on the street...
oh my god, sir!
thirty-percent.  no more.  or i call another lawyer.  this is the biggest case of your life.  don't try to negotiate.  thirty percent.  say yes or no.
because you buckled.
this is 132, over.
dad.  do you believe me?
you won't be lonely, charles...
parts.
i know. simultaneously, they shake and zip. claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
how did you ever remember me?
he's busy being dead.
you're not trained for that.  none of us are... i mean, sometimes i...  okay, let's say you had gone back. what then?  are you bulletproof?
goodbye, dante.
you'd prefer that? ... james...you don't really have a gun, do you.
it's home.
laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. you can still remember home.
yeah, like people in love.
it's very personal. it couldn't be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you?
re-runs?
what do you think?
yeah, i think so...
there's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred-and- first near ramelle.  i want you to take a squad up there.  if he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
david, let's go now.
yes, sir. the day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "free india." then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
yeah, sure...
well, i don't know; maybe she does deserve it. maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
yes.
but you used to say --
he has been attending at balmoral for many years.
after dinner, you and i will take shifts throughout the night. i don't want to chance miss anything.
that is horrible. apes are dirty. no?
do something!  stall them!
yah, how ya doin'. so, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
dick can't be dead. who told you he was dead?
i know where everything is.
i'm serious.
this is a cobra, mr. grange.  yes, it is real.
hang tough, gator. hang in there, man, you're gonna be ok... just hang on.
this is richter sir...i've got them pinned down.
jim.  what's yours?
please, pop, just go back to your room.
probably.
oh, shit... i'm sorry... i thought that was... i'm so sorry...
i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements. boundaries of their constraint. kentucky state law about. i want you to drop everything.
yeah, but i hardly noticed it. i'm more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
'start-up not 50 miles from here. kid's on prozac.
see that it is.  take me over, please.
well... i'll act like i do until i do.
sell the movie rights.  we're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
that's not true...
merry christmas.
hear me out.  i've known you a long time.  i see a difference in you this week.  like that tie. i'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. especially when i see her talking with david kross.
you ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to washinton, are ya? they done that to one of our girls once. leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
what the fuck do you want from me?
i have to talk to you in a second about that, lance, ok?
of course, officer.
she ain't missing so much as she's run away.
she's fine, as if you cared.
and what do they got, dude?  my dirty undies.  my fucking whites--say, where is  the car?
says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon. listen, we've also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. i'd keep my eyes open if i were you, sam. bye.
fuck!
what's this?
that's better. yes?
i want to interview earl williams, warden. how about a little service?
let's go.  do us both a favor.
things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
it's nothin'. i'm gettin' married.
28   continued:
of course.  mary clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  a membership that, i am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program?
razor and blade! they're flakes!
it's a real good chocolate cake. duncan hines' devil's food. real good.
research, my ass. i suppose these are the 'extra expenses' i've been paying for? and in the middle of the morning, too.
what octopus motor?
christ, traxler. how the hell should i know?
how many, would you say?
there may be two... no, three who could fit it.
yes.  what do you mean by 'hippies'?
of the nature of mrs. holland's illness.  and, of course, the events which led up to it.
she was the last person seen with the guy -- i'll take the responsibility.
yes.
what happened to your toe?
i don't expect you to.
be patient.
these people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
he suspects i know something. i think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case i do.  we have to go in tonight. i'm two hours from a beta version.  but i've gotta go home for an hour.
luck's a funny thing. especially the bad.
you can't find... what?
i was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...would you like to go to dinner? i know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
you're in the malahide institute. it's a psychiatric hospital. but, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. remember? you and your boyfriend...?
thomas sandefur...
i'm sorry? what are you oozing about?
is annie around?
does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
trust me, you don't. i actually have to wear a bra now. and i have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
i had been sold to the english.  i'd rather die than fall into their hands.
i'll take it.  what's the matter, mr. burns -- don't you understand english? -- why, your language is shocking, mr. burns -- positively shocking! i don't mind because i was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose central is listening in... oh, did you hear that, central? we ought to report him, don't you think?... oh, fooey on you!
i have not, i would <u>not</u>.  for life  life goes on starling.  and, wait, wait, i wish to <u>talk</u> to you... i'm...    one moment.  i was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr. lechter.  i was <u>afflicted</u> before. before.  do you see?  in my arrogance. do not  do not curse god when you are humiliated.  listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>god</u>...
well, gerald, i think you're afraid.
to old friends.
dad says you're late again, you butthole!
something i really wish i had not seen. never mind it.  did you find the victims' loan agreements?
like "three thousand a ki?"  that's nice. and i can supply the transportation into south florida and the gulf, more reliable and on-time than fedex.  but, three per ki was ok for openers.
what do you expect to find? a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
pumpkin? what's wrong?
all i said in the note was: "where are you?" that doesn't sound desperate to me.
no! should i?
no.
girl's gotta make a living.
should i bring him in.
how will they know we're coming?
i was trying to save you. they were going to vaporize you.
i am.
man?
and look what i got.
two double whiskeys. was wunschen sie?
are you the one who left that note?
hi sandy.
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
i was talking to the cat.
the argies.
right. best cowboy that ever punched deck. the old man taught me most of what i know.
it's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
this door's locked.  try shooting the hinges off.
your "sixth sense"- i've always wondered where it came from.  and what about soran?
you don't hang out with the other guys.
ron...ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
of course darling, you'd like to apologise?
jones...come with me.  cobb, you and doc check the rooms.
shari, i'm just really sorry. look, i know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if i could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
no jeremy.
i'm not really, uh.
true.
i used to hate it.  now i like it.
well, i been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  and you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
i thought you said you were doing to break it off.
hi. this is nikki. leave a message. 
i already got it. everything i want.
that's bullshit, jeff!
wing to cruise configuration... full impulse power.
i got money.
come in out of the rain, bud.
you've got the wrong idea about me. i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger.  can you help me find him?  i'll pay you anything.
<u>four</u> to go.
she looked dead. still does.
i said forget it!
i have already heard about this cafe, and also about mr. rick himself.
i don't know.  it was like a tug. something tugged us.
i wish you wouldn't do this. it doesn't make any sense. let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
have you ever been with a male band?
so what?
sure.
we've worked up several military scenarios. before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options, i'd like for us to adopt a rule. if we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. because once they are, i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
-- what?
huh? but why did healy?
sing!
i said, skip it, michael. it's my treatment.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
yes, sir, that's exactly who i am, sir... and what i am... a victim, sir. mr. alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
jesus chri--  we're on a very slippery slope here, sam.  a covert military operation riddled with civilian...
you didn't say 'symington says'.
that's fine. thanks. i'll look 'em over later.
yes, you can.  come on, shelly!
i am riding to dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
i don't.
okay, he's just a wilbur then.
hand-holds?!  i can barely see them.
but i have my clothes on!
dad, no!
i'm sorry, rob, but i'm struggling here.  i don't understand any part of this conversation.  you're asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  what am i supposed to say?
nonsense. your novels are very popular here. aren't they, sergeant?
they own the whole building.  they just move from floor to floor.
something like that. how much do you make?
oh no.
sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
good for you.
i smell nothing.
yeah, how can we help? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
hurts.  hurts pretty bad.
oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  look at them.
he was a good friend... the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship.
take it easy. what's goin' on anyway? why are you in so much trouble?
i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard.
i don't like horror movies!
my guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
let's just say, he looks after your interests.
it's about time.
it's not suicide if you're already dead. two...
sit... and spin.
try to communicate with her somehow.
you wouldn't?
that must make it tough.
and what of the enterprise?
you tell him nothing, emmi. if he calls again, you say you know nothing. we're gonna keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. and, god help me, with beethoven.
well, i hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
i will be happy if i have you. i love you.
i'm fine.  i just need to lie down...
that's why mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
who the hell made this map.
what business?
_ your father raped someone?
had some bad relationships, didn't you.
you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
maybe he wants something.
i wish it would rain...
if you're doing all this just for me.
yeah... she's okay, though.
some campers drowned. then some counselors got killed.
rocky road.
i take it back, about the flowers.  we're all gonna die.
ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  we can all agree to disagree without making threats.
that's very pragmatic of you, barnes.
i mean...things.  ted, joanna's very unhappy and--
most women wouldn't choose it.
sure. do you really know annie hayworth?
they report it to the irs.
make-up. you need it.  hey, roman isn't here?
texas... you were right about what happened to me there.
we can't go anywhere until i get to a phone.
no long-distance phone calls, federal express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
it ain't geronimo.
the ambulance guys lugged him up.
maude, do you pray?
yes.  and so terribly annoying when they cry.  i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
'fraid so.
you think it can go faster than an f- 36?
i counted on you to help my cause. you and that thug are obviously failing. aren't we ever going on our date?
vito... cor... ni-lious... priest...
marty, please. let me talk to him.
it's your problem.
like what?
i can't grow a moustache. it never comes in evenly.
well i like your style too, man. got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
how the hell should i know how much?
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards?
vada, i know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
come on.  let me buy you something to eat.  looks like you could use the company.
keep saying what?
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
who's your partner?
we paid attention in school.
then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing eve was her understudy-
that's okay, mom.  i can see it later.  i'll help you unload.
that would be the reason.
you...
i always wanted to go to madison square garden.  see the knicks play.
i made it up.  it's horseshit!
just got here.
you do a lot of real estate trading, brandon?
how?
i'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
backstabber?
the empire won't look for you out here.  i'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
yeah. what about the kids' school?
ten gees.
i don't know. she got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
what else is new?. right?
i got it from the tournament directory.
it's a common question.
aw come on, miss price!
well, her, it ain't. that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
human bean juice.  the comedian is dead.
with the pearls --
you really love me, don't you?
how are you?
it's a method for quitting smoking.
absolutely!
look, whatever your marharagi, told you, forget. you've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
you're a great architect, albert.
what are you talking about?
you can't give up.
it's lieutenant sam baffert from the san francisco police department.
who are you anyway ? what the hell is this ?
were you disappointed?
a hunch.  things he said.  like, knowing how to recognize a phony id --
george? was he alone?
hi, mrs. boatwright...  i'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day, miss boatwright.
odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
we was by the river? and i hear my friend callin' for help, and i look and she has falling in the water--
what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
out?
you're getting defensive, will.
well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
they only took electrical appliances.
it seems that you and i have some talking to do.
i'm not -- i didn't -- al, you know how i feel about you...
what?
early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. i don't know why you're saying those things. you ain't my friend.
sure you do. this ward is air tight, i have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
who! who's running?!! who have we been chasing!?? can i ask this question now!!!
you believe in anything?
please. please don't forgive me. i've always hated you for that.
like he'd never hire me for real.  not week-to-week.  i don't have the credentials.  he thinks i'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
somebody told her.
what else did he get?
i will continue with our french allies, concentrating on new york.
did i ever tell you what tina wrote? the night she died?
paulie, it's thanksgiving. i've gotta turkey in the oven.
yeah. definitely.
yeah, old times.
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son.
i heard already.
-- he's gettin' good on those eggs. and y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
i would like you to go quickly over to the resdence damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of the roman ritual. the large one. i believe we should begin.
no. no, that's ray, here. ray, uh...  ray... little weasel.
six.
you know i'm scared of heights.
not very.
no, they don't.
let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
that'll make the folks very happy.
no, but you might need them when you get back.
so what?
then why go back now?
shouldn't be long.  a couple of weeks maybe.
i used to tell myself. talent is more erotic when it's wasted. will i see you tonight?
they got it an a long playing record now - music to string her along by. my wife doesn't understand me -- we haven't gotten along for years -- you're the best thing that ever happened to me --
you trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
transfer.
my parents know i'm out.  they know i'm here.
he's in there!  or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
far as i know, yeah, that was her.
rick, i'll put my cards on the table. i think you know where those letters are.
okay, joe...
too late for what?  too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  well, you won't do it, i tell you.  you won't do it!
well dude, we just don't know.
sorry.  too perfect.
leave her out of this!
everybody has a great body now.
thanks. i'll tell mike.  well, it's still just a beginning. i know i can...dig deeper.
he said if i gave in to you i'd start losing again.
don't know.  ask around.  i'll be back.
what else?  from virginia?
drunk again?
that's a lie. he's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. and if you ask me, that's where you belong.
order fromberge to keep him in safety!  it is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
a water main broke.
i don't rightly know, sir.
sure. fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
he did, but... i think i can change his mind.
i should be better by now.
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
i know -- i know -- but it will be sunny in tremezzo. we'll have a guest then.
good.
cut him loose.  the d.a. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
larry bought himself cologne?
too much school.
don't worry, i'll desire. boris, could i have some more coffee.
we got five. putting ashley outside.
i went into their room this afternoon.
you must believe me.
what kind of information?
and i'm dying. they don't know that. all they know is they're not to make a move until joe cabot shows up. i was sent undercover to get cabot. you heard 'em, they said he's on his way. don't pussy out on me now, marvin. we're just gonna sit here and bleed until joe cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
chase, you'd better come home.
wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get wendy to like me.
i think it's a pig hair. <i></i> how much is mcdonald's offering?
did you get starside r&d ?
then do it.
oh, i believe it.
what's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
oh my god, a mistake!
oy... not a road trip. i get wagon sick, you know that.
for two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. the manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, delyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. can you imagine? all you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
don't go.
uh, i don't have much of an appetite lately.
what?
how soon?...
jesus, she reeks of laura ashley.  oh, she's crying. wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
who are they?
john...
i hate to conduct business on the lanai. why don't we step inside.
yeah, well, just stop yelling.
promise?
of his penis, sir?
chang's first question was about the pilot.
and they didn't believe the symptoms i described...
you're right.  maybe this'll save some time.
no problem, master-c. if you've seen one consumer electronics show...  what's up?
monsieur masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. he's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
you, too.
water.
no.
i've been all over town. i got a call from the bondman.  he says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. they're going to take away the house.
i ain't drinking hot piss with you. come on, sam.
you know damn well what we both make of it.
frank. it's jake. jacob singer.
that's not a problem. are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
describe him.
ajaccio.
claymore.
i'm not leaving it here.
since the murder. she was fine before that.
i think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
it'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
don't worry about it. he's not gettin' any and neither are you.
oh, paul. it would be an honor.
enjoy it while you can, vin. pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
maybe not... i don't know.  i'm not sure i'm gonna go.  she doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
not long -- now.
y'didn't?
you know what i'm talking about.
i want to talk to leon.
you'll get it when we get there.
quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
one: it's illegal. two: i didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
it's very convincing.
so now you've got to talk him out of it. and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
one.
it's his life insurance money, you know.
once a musketeer, always a musketeer, eh?
yesterday.
you want to hear about destiny? if my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, i would never have been on that flight to miami, and met rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
pretty serious.
ohhh. you're in therapy too, marty?
oh, listen to me. i've never even been there and look what i say about it. anyway, i know there'd be nothing for me to do. i don't even know anybody there.
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for wichita's lightning rod?
up ahead!
you're joking, right? i mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
we'd better get everybody online.  and kyle, stop downloading porn.  your frame rate is unacceptable.
pretty clever:  if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, sam's is the first place they'll look.  they may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  i can't afford any trouble --
ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. and you don't have to lift a finger. it'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
i'm sure we will.
speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow moss want?
well, i never heard that one.
i'll have to do better than that.
really?
oh -- okay.
nothing.
yeah.
name's pritchett. watson pritchett. i own the house, my father built it. and now i just need to get you into it. so...
he tortures toys -- just for fun.
no.  it's the truth.  i know what you are.  like me, like bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  you don't have a social security number.  you don't pay taxes.  you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  you think you can do it again.  but i'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.
i have acted as i think fit.
yeah, that's why i walked down here.
oh that's right -- they squished him... heck of a guy.
where was your father born?
you still think he's in there?
oh, jesus!
good.
nothing.  there ain't nothing in room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  you understand, stay out!
love...
i have to get back.
yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
okay, lou-is.
name your stakes.
it would be five thousand more.
look. talk. not talk.
you mean...!
i don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
dela, kiss my big black ass.
no.
i didn't have time.
don't move!
and the fifty's all gone, huh? who's the ten for?
was mom an adjustment?
excuse me?
that's the man. he's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. him and his family owned these islands 'round here. they was leasin' this one to the fed. the whole underneath is dug out. there was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. now this is dickerson's....gasparilla's... private fortress. him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
because you've got nothing else to live for.
where are they?
-- and she was positively glowing at the awards.  i should be going, she'll be here soon --
since when do you talk like that?
he isn't here.
but she'll have no one to look after her!
that's okay by me! 'cause as far as i'm concerned, i'm through with newspapers! see? i'm through with stupidity! i'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if i have to starve.  yeah? what about my novel! when i get through with that—
-- and i'm through playin' games.
do you have a car, steph?
obviously, i'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  the uss maggie leaves quite a wake... excuse me.
they want us to take our missiles out of turkey along with the no invasion pledge. it looks like fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
if you must know, virtually nothing.
he's right.  follow me.
yes.
he doesn't hear too well.
taransky isn't that good an actor. no, they're taking special precautions.  some kind of new encryption.
huh. st. bernard's. figures it's named after a canine.
now i get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. you're part of a cult.
yeah, that was easy.
president.
didn't get it.
a load of amphetamine i told him i had.
indian?
oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
no time, no time, yes. sit, sit, sit. alex sits next to him.
you can bring them with a word.
has mr. kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
cleaning up a mess.
so i've noticed.
mind your own business, peaches.
some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
that's your name, isn't it?
well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
it's not exploitation.  these people wanna sell and i wanna buy. how are golf clubs exploitation?  she takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
someone waiting for you?
marv,  ...i just bagged the elephant!
what is it?
recognizers!
didn't show up.
four or five days.
i sure as hell got my wish.  she doesn't exist.  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
new york. that's up north, ain't it? they'll find we do things different down here.
okay.
gaston monescu.
it's late.
i don't know how you do it. i've never even dated anybody but charlie.
i'm hungry, john.
oh... kinda the same way.
me too.
that's the whole point, jeffrey. that's the whole point. anyone's. everyone's. they are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. they are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. don't you understand?
sure.
you're taking me home!
first place, you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio.  now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
you want to change rooms?
okay.
ah believe i smell me a blonde-haired lady.
hello, vi.
when? when did you ever see me use?
i see. all right. you finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
did you now?
you look beautiful to me.
i'm looking for some pacific-tech professors...
wolf one -- say intentions.
uhh, miss devoto, these people are already at ease. this is not a beauty parlor, it's a funeral parlor.
baxter, i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man. you realize what you're doing? not to me -- but to yourself. normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. you dig?
leave this house.
you're crazy!
are you ready to order?
what? no. use the bathroom on the plane!
wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
and you're not the wife.
they're topside.  we're ready to take you home, sir.
what's wrong?
yes.  dropping off.
soy sauce...
uh...yes, at the moment.
not on the map.  looks like it connects with the city sewer.
why didn't you stop me?
i can't tonight.
how do you know if you've never tried?
how'd you know my name, mister?
yeah.
oh dear god...
i know what i see.
you know you can.
don't you die on me!! this is baby suggs quilt. is that what you planning!?
who cares what your name is? who cares if you're mr. pink, mr. purple, mr. pussy, mr. piss...
yeah?
no... i've seen her. good-looking woman.
i never get my hair done.
would you go on back to the hotel? take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
you believe that?
i hate that -- every time i hear that noise something terrible happens.
ugh.
hell, no. but you missed a damn good sermon. "you can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord."
can't say, sir.
right here.
yes.
in a computer program.
i didn't want to wake you.
that's what i said--the *truth*!
it doesn't matter.
a lucas jackson.
sure.
i'm joel.
why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
dwarf bowling's illegal.
what'll you do?  come out.
speaking of which...
there's kind of this guy i'm seeing.
i can use the station in medical, keep an eye on justin...
i'm just saying...
i want your money, i'll take your money.
i'm so excited i just can't hide it.  i'm about to lode control and i think i like it.
roy.
jesus. we've been at this for six months.
don't start on me today.
sleep for a week.  wanna join me?
ah, charley and i are...well, we're thinking about...i mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
you are.
don't be ridiculous, we're having a serious conversation!
forgiven.  you know, when we were on that plane, i was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. it was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. and i've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and i'm that silly shadow. that all my life i've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
yes.  isn't that amazing?
who?!
well, i'm a working girl, mr. gittes. i didn't come in to see you on my own.
i'm thinking of it.
i want to know.
ben is very ill.
so?
move in with me.
yes.
louis, this is it, man. i'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. i already got me a half-a- million sittin' in mexico. when i do this last delivery, i'm gonna make me another half-million.
turn the tapes back on.
but i...
well do you like him?
ain't your fault -- here's the problem.
yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
how do you do.
i'm...tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, i didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
hyperactive little fuckers, too. tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, i bet.
i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard.  in the event of any disturbance i will ensure --
leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it didn't exist... and, leon... i can't say it...
you think they could talk to each other?
i want to fly jets, sir!
it will be okay if i sleep. i need to lie down and sleep.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
yes, i...
agent novak.  i didn't get a chance to clear him.
i...i don't know...
....i hardly <u>think</u> so... after "the incident"...
looking for the fossils.  why should we wait until we're in london?  this girl was probably twelve years old.
in order to keep elaine away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything.
turn-offs?
no! they said no cops! they were darned clear on that, wade! they said you call the cops and we -
my god... did you get a look at who did it?
whatever it is just do it. the more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
may i keep the file?
we're in motion on something.
almost four years.
get out, i call 911.
what if--
no! i never hear it!  maybe.  sometimes.  i don't know. but i won't let it bother me.
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford. i am chattar lal, prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot.
well now, ratso, i'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
no!  no different!  the differences are in your mind.  throw them out! no longer of use are they to you.
... deborah ann kaye ...
max, are we driving through plutonium?
i want to stop taking those pills.
please tell me it isn't that teenager!
the sera monks have surrendered?
you know what this tape could do if it gets out.
mary clarence, could you?  mary lazarus, you're terrific, but...  could you help us?
oh no.
what is she shooting?
what do you want to do?
billy?  this was on miller's forehead.  any idea what it is?
it's me who's wastin' time, sailor, bein' with you.
could do, yeah.
okay.  okay.
it's the oily fish tonight. not before the plane ride.
no.  we talked about history, and siberian geese.
i'm sorry.
nope.
how they were just there ... waiting on us ... the fix was definitely in ...
joyce, give the assistant chief inspector a drink, would you?
i've already made arrangements.
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
we can't.  those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
jesus...
indeedldid, mylord. itwas one ofthe first to cross.
this is a school... that's a student's work.  she'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
not unless you can fly.
i won't.
i just...
hi.
do you like porno movies?
we've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
i am ashamed to say he is.  look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, charles.  and sarah?  forget it.  you can't get her out of bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
that's what i thought, man.  but it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. it was someplace else.
what do you mean, what is it? it's some political bullshit.
no.
bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
well... you're all right now, i guess. i have to get down to the track.
you could say that.
i don't know...  me.
i guess there's an exception to every rule.
victoria.
yes -
and what do they know?
i'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  the kirbys.
yeah. sure. i'm screwing up the song. you're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
you really are pathetic, you know that? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. he is nothing compared to me.
okay... i'll go back.  but just let them know, first they ain't gettin' latka.  they're gettin' tony!
we understand you, mr. bangs.
what?
you believe that?
you have ruined weeks of work here! we've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
we can be real quiet...
i do like you, sheila.
no -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  but how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
page boys!
i'm high as a kite.
isn't everybody part of everybody else?
if junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
i'm just resting my feet.
buzzing?
i didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, i know --
when you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the university?
come on, xander. you used to stand for something. what happened to you, man? i thought you'd get it.
a native is someone who is born in a particular place.
i can't blame anything on hal. it was me.  i play it back in my mind everyday.
do they have those ... where you come from?
people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
my pills...
helpless...
i was misquoted.
best get down close to the moat, lad.
the alps.
erin.  cool.  what can i do for you, erin?
i don't love neddy.
you don't call.
would you shut the fuck up?  who the fuck is in the bathroom?
accept you?
yes.
jesus.  i do not know.  i'll talk to you later.
hey, bud.
i agree.
i should maybe go to the bathroom.
my husband the hero.
i just know how you get. good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
business appointment. i'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
in a little while i'll help you understand.
no shit, come on. how you gonna do that?
any others?
but what became of your lamb?  clarice...?
be my friend.
where is he? where's j.d.?
i am zuul.  i am ...
satisfied, wiseass?
yeah, let's talk about that.  you seem to be rather an expert.  i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
but ed, we're not even married.  and you don't have a job.
desperate.  to talk.
i'm stag.
almost a year.
i know!  i know!
not this time.
could you believe that fire? man! first day! there i was, adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! i love it here -- no surround and drown for this company. fighting 17th! goddamn stephen's amazing. you see how he took that fire by the balls? i'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
yes. the five men. they were, of course, your husband, charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and carson dyle. but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
yes?
i wasn't satisfied! i suppose i proposed to you!
i love you.
that's like saying they're in arizona.
i was a successful model once.
so where are you?
i was praying.
how do we know that?
fifty, right?
let's split up. you take the left side, i'll take the right. we'll meet in front of the cineplex.
what about?
what?
it's just money.
you know, dah--
that's what you said...
mr. reuben, i swear to god, they were out of line.
after he moved out, i invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. he didn't show, not once.
[your brother wants to talk to you.]
i'm in love with you.  don't you know that? i've been in love with you all along.
yeah, "brother" my best friend is stone dead.
now, now. he's a good boy.
"probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  doesn't apply here.
don't question me, captain!  this is <u>my</u> crime scene!
they obviously weren't designed for racing.
they've got a book for everything.
what about the share.
i understand, dick.
still am.  there's more gold than i thought, and since there's only two of us now...  where should i go?
i can't, i have to go home.
mornin', daddy...
i go to college. i thought you knew.
surge from astern, sir. aft quarter!
look, enough of this "mr white" shit -
now? i don't know. i know that i'll never have the strength to leave you again.
that's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
where's the drop?
good.
don't worry -- it comes off today.
whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with jason voorhees.  i want you to be safe, rennie. that's all i care about.
what about the gold?
ok.
kat.
she didn't know he was a criminal. they had a relationship. they --
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm.
what about michael corleone?
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
john hammond.
yes, it is.
did i say i wanted a cheap room to live in -- when i came here did i ask for a cheap room? did i?
fine.  did you have a good time last night?
i don't see the connection.
miles, it's sunday.  you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.
now danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
home after.  will you come in and say "hi"?
and who's this susan when she's at home?
what makes you think we're more interesting?
give you nose bleeds?
i'm still hungry, brad.  let's go to rector's and get something decent.  the "chronicle" has a two-column headline, mr. carter.  why haven't we?
you were taken for a buggy ride?
i've got what i need for my report. there is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
brill's dead. he died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a kansas field.  my name doesn't matter.
i love you.
how many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
what about you, mare? how the hell'd you manage to stay single?
no.
your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
yeah, really.
thank you. very nice.
so, you're a righty?
i don't think so.
bag-snatcher.
we can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
adele... are you serious?
licensed attorney or family member?
vaughan, don't get pushy.
maurice and ellen parker... it was issued in philly... mr. maurice parker has come a long way from home.  why?
fine. don't come crying to boyd. no sir.
well, goodbye.
we got about forty bucks, sweetheart. that'd get us to el paso.
okay.  all aboard - new york, new york!
simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? my father is dying. perhaps you should think of our coronation.
hey beni! looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
admiral, i'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
engine room, what happened?
two-fifty? they go up?
my parents baby-sitter canceled.
that's it except for the first. we got the sheraton, the ambassador, or the holiday inn on sixtieth.  all three-day turns.
wait god-dammit!
did you build the estadio olympico?
i'm sorry, dude, but—i—
that's right.
don't you worry about sueleen gay.
which ranch?
yes?
giddy-up.
i sell them at the recycling center. gives me a little for gas and food.
now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... but i already told you...
yeah -- when you're sixteen.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. in her whole life.
what kind of trouble are you in?
that would be the baron's way. there'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
even if this vincent luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
oh thank god, you're dead...
good night.
hey, where's claude? i don't see claude!
you tell me again.
don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
yah?
we must have been heroic.
as close as a deal could be.
there was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister. across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
what for? to recover that knife you stuck in my back?
no.
i shouldn't have listened to you, i should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
now wait a minute!
i know who you are.
just a little experiment.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
somehow i expected not.
radon leakage?
madmartigan.
all right. that's all.  please, matt.
you don't have to tell me. it's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress. i just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
my father's company imports and exports. archaeology is part of the business. we happen to get along just fine, smartass. look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
you serious? this is how you guys do business? i can't believe you aren't dead.
hold on. stop. take a deep breath. tell me what happened.
you probably don't remember her, but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29. when she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
don't uncle claude me. you get a load of those crackers? couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
i'd love to, but i've got an open house today at the ressler place.
that's it! i'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. goodbye.
it's that time of year again. we should get a pretty good show out here.
fly... yes. land... no.
yes, sir.
yeah, exactly.  those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
halfway 'round the world.  so that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
i gotta piss.
no.
there should be some kind of manual release...
i don't like to give up.
bomb must have gone off inside the ship. nothing we can do about it now. hey, it looks like... the skipper. he made it. commander powell made it!
maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
you weren't at harrison's department store the night before--
i'm sorry.  i didn't get down what magazines you're from.
did i tell you?  did you listen to me?  oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  no, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  the names you called me.  well, don't say i didn't tell you.
i'll get you close.
you didn't wake me.  i'll be out of here in a minute.
of course. our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
which street corner?
it's really happening.
you're not exactly the type we're looking for.
i don't agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
it's not the first. there's been several. and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
it's sunday.
jesus christ, michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
did he rob it?
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and i'll bet there were enough witnesses.
yes.
and losing you, we’d lose him. and that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
yes, i know…but still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
i'll pay you.
i'll try, d-d-dammit! you can't ask any more than that!
it means i'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
doing what? cleaning toilets?
i'm in no mood for dancing.
so that's what you been doing?
william has just turned down anna scott.
--amazing coincidence! of all places in the world--to choose willet creek for his boys' camp!
the word is no.  i am therefore going anyway.
let me out! let me out of here!
so that's where you are. i might of known it. no wonder you couldn't hear me.
you'll get to meet them all tomorrow. they're...survivors.  in a way.  all severely sleep disordered.  insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
wearing them?  or humping them?
you should have told me who you were working for.
who is it?
joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
--deep throat won't confirm--i never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of haldeman.
fine. but what would i do at night?
give it to me!
you know how rumors start.
gifts?
god bless you, maggie.
no.
i understand perfectly, mr. pinkus, and as long as i am mayor --
you are me.
why did you come here?
don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
and why's that?
if you can trail him to a remote area do it. we all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
i mean, the other night was... i felt like you understood something i could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  i won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. you following me again?
i don't like all those other clowns around. that's all i know.
hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. i'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
my attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for chrissake.
i don't think so.  are you coming, charles?
i've felt that way, yeah.
what?
i think so, too.
congratulations, mrs. kramer. you have just rewritten matrimonial law.  you were both divorced, mrs. kramer.
while you're at it, let me see what else is in there. you mind?
listen to me!
ah-ha.  so what is that--a radio?
citizen bourrienne to see you, sir.
i thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
now: i'm looking at the...
let me go first; you stay behind me.
i just want a friend. just one friend for just one minute...
thank you, mothershead. have a porter put them in my office.
we'll get into that later.
why do you do things like that? you know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
two pianos isn't enough anymore, jack.
we always planned to use it. we got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. the beatnicks were before my time, and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
yes. yes. let me out!
if i could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt i wouldn't let it end like this! you need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
i'll be around and back in town in a few days --
don't guess. just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you i'm heading east.
yeah.
turn off the engine.
we know you, we've seen you before like this. is it over - or just beginning?
well, take them off.
if title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, i wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. but i did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. hence, even though i'm a clerk in this video store, i choose to go rent videos at big choice.  agreed?
like you said-she snowballed him.
were you listening?  we got two officers in the hospital.  yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  look at him!  still on his feet.
goodnight.
my arm!  he took my fucking arm!
it's the transponder.
yes.
what?  no!
wait, no, i... look, sooze, i figured something out.
was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
how?
it's a very big one.
the sun is setting, logan.  you've been asleep for nineteen hours.
that's right.
my name's gilroy. i'm from the state certification board.
very simple, earl.
as below, so above.  you hold the univers, willow, in your hand.
yes, sir.
no! i can't explain now. oh, look -- the pearls. you wear them now...
i don't believe that.
you know my back -
what if--
oh yeah.  yeah.  well ... look, i'll make a deal with you ... my boyfriend threw me out, right?  i'll trade you. you give me couch-space.  i'll give you talk.  ok?
... what are they all doing there?
i'm so sorry.
well, i do declare!  i baptized you, son.
i don't need a little.  i need a lot.
any planets?
do you ever get sick of it?
because i don't like you.
send his bags up to my room.
i go to school, don't i?
affirmative, big duke six -- we're even got some rockets left.
put your right foot there --
i wasn't angry with you i was angry with him.
he hadn't even been there. and all those years i thought he was dead.
you're sorry. christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
no. please. i won't.
i've taken a lot of morphine.  oral morphine...for my back.  can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing?
what?
you're not gonna kill me...
okay. then, tomorrow, i take the kids with me to the picket line.
oh, yeah - - great.
obviously not. look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
in fifteen years, i have never left a customer unsatisfied.
put on your blue suit...
so then this isn't crazy.  it's a sure bet.
they can't reduce nuclear fuel. but once the reactor's miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
i don't want you to be sorry, alan, i want you to be excited.  i want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  you know why?
... yes, that's fine.  of course.  i... you know... of course... i'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
so there was money there!  who the hell's money is it?!
the mirror.  you can't see yourself in it.
yes. tell me about the day you got off the train.
they know me.
i didn't know tony bennett painted.
don't try me.
bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
not true!  the secret is mastering the urge.
where'd she go?
thank you.
close that door. don't let anybody in or out.
i apologize for the inconvenience, but i must ask you some...
i don't think they're in school.
you think i made that up about the gun...
we got friends in the commission.
yeah. you know...hang out.
that explains it. i'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
i will?
we must examine you.
now come on - you're acting silly -- 
for five thousand?
indeed.
what makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
little nervous. wanna puke.
good.  ba will have to teach you to spin too.
yes, yes... let's talk about that.... your roots... your father is from haiti, isn't he?
i disappear. it’s not about me.
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
hole in one! you're the queen of stroke!
and how's the diva doing?
oh?  what do you call it then --a success?  the marriage ended in divorce.
well, i flew single-engine fighters in the air force, but this plane has four engines. it's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
you stick around i'll pull the memo for you.  i'm busy now...
hey.  i'm a professional.
i want to make you happy, toto! i'm going to tell you a story.  once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! and he immediately fell in love with her. but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...one day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end i'll be yours.' christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! one day, two days, ten, twenty...every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. come rain, wind, snow, never budged! the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. he didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. the princess kept watch...and on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
i have to throw up...
don't get hurt.
a cop?
look, i don’t know what’s going on here but i am senior vice president of this company.
please put your clothes on
me and my real estate? how  many other girls, miss teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a park avenue address like this?
cut to the fucking chase, flynne.
i haven't the slightest idea.
it isn't a story - it's true.  i did see wynant.  he's not dead.
so help me god!
i suppose guinness will suffice.
i'm glad you like it. it's made right here in the valley.
well, look, i have to go. gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
lucky guess.  and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
can i have the gun?
how are you, carl ?
but how?
nyah still on the property?
you'll be my first.
shut-up.
what are you talking about?
i'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
"eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
such nice boys! it makes me sick to --
noooo! noooo!!!
who cares? as long as they're keeping donovan busy. dad, you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation.
what's that, not great?
do you miss having someone to talk to, hanna?
that's far out!
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
it looks delicious.
yeah... i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show.
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
no. but i gave my word.
i was here this afternoon.
two-hundred dollars.
you wife isn't dead is she?
a thousand dollars?
yes.
my aunt in australia has offered..
excuse me.
no, we're not.
but, in particular?
what???
uh ... we'll let you know.
oh.  well, yes.  it's extraordinary.  you think you could sign it for us?
yes, it did.
really? you'd do that for me?
yessir.
it was krueger, wasn't it?
fuck you.
what magic have we on our side?
yes! this was how i could be put out of the senate and out of the way! they even *promised* me that if i--
because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
you know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? he's just gonna call the cops again.
what did you watch?
you think she'd go through with it?
keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. right?
well, that's very nice. thank you.
you got it.
in other words, all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
what?  what popped in there?
...deborah ann kaye...
actually, yes.  it's by no means bad, i...
my name's david.
you see the sign! it's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
mama, don't i always do what you say -- every time i go to the fields to plant the corn, to miss boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and i do it, and you don't worry.
yes.
you put it back in the wrong place... do you like renoir?
he will.
i had a feeling you would.
then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
clarence, you do a good job with george bailey, and you'll get your wings.
i wanna live with a musician.  she'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
home. watching tv.
oh, no!
i wouldn't dream of it.
we've already begun.
no.
would you have leaned over rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
are you french?
i don't need any advice from you! get me a doctor!
listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
it's not what you think, jake.
that's new york, baby. you should know that. look at the waitresses. i'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
no, you're not.
alexander... i know you.
what?
why you say that?
siddown, dick.  they're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
you don't remember?
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
one ball!! they come all the way here... i close the damn store... for one ball!
well--i haven't needed much law so far--what i'd like to get first is a little common sense--
then whose is it? his or theirs?
no it is not, mr. dowd.
alan. alan bailey.
you're both going to a lot of trouble--  maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  i'm sure you're sincere...  ...but i was being groomed for something like this myself.  even without the accident i don't think i would have made it.  my point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
jerry lee lewis, elvis, dinky doo and the don't's.  let's book, charlie.  if he starts on motown, we'll be here all night.
oh, "starry night" time, huh?
my wife and i are just taking a little vacation.
i say we head out.
i'm sorry.  that's very sweet, edward, and i know you mean it...
no! that was years ago! i've lived years since then.
you want...
no.  what happened... no one expected it.
do you think that's what he wants?
yes, amy?
if we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
i can't believe he'd do this.
that's not possible. i told you.
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
no -- i wanted to be a professional hockey player.
it's not a theta --
we can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
you don't know that for sure.
all right, all right. you can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
oh, man, i've been trying to call you.
missus. very pleased to meet you.
a federation starship.
he is. usually.
don't worry.  i'll pay for it. what a you charge?  huh?  twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  are you a fifty dollar whore?
the shi'ites are on our side?  i didn't know that.
it's okay, my sweet.
i don't want anything.  i'm just a really big, big fan.  i've seen all your movies.
can we talk?
i guess i'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
you go down there.
we shouldn't have been here, epps.  there is a war going on!
that's not what i meant.  i don't care about the sword.
hmm?
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  unsubtitled
who?
well, game five was the big one.  it turned in the bottom of the 6th.  we were down 3-0.  cleon jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. clendenon comes up.  the count goes to 2 2.  high fastball.  he nailed it.  weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. jones and swoboda scored in the 8th.  we won, pop.
captain who?
no, i don't.
man, you know i'm good for it. thousand bucks ain't shit.
uh-huh.
that's frustrating.
why?
yeah, i haven't really absorbed that one.
good heart, at what?
can i go over to janeane's house?
oh.
tom ripley. thank you, sir.
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw.
he ain't the problem, jack.
no, thank you.
don't do it, norman!
'n daniel webster will be there.
i'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
dr. lecter -
yes, sir...
i thought i heard someone knocking.
my eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
nick, no --
don't be. your movie's a hit.
no, i couldn't do that.
nah.
what other boat?
where did you see it?
yes.
that's disrespectful.
you're very direct, mr. felson.
that's what you said in the last three piss pots.
i got drunk.
thanks.
i've got all these signs here...
 yeah.
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. the same numbers everyday for sixteen years. one day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. they hit the lucky seven for one point two million.
let's go.
i care for you, too. but you'll be around, don't say that.
it's so damn quiet out there.
if you say so.
yep.  looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
i'll bet he would.
naw, right here's okay.
please!... that's not like you.
okay -- yeah, i can, i respect that.
good, 'cause this isn't an american teen princess pageant -- it's, it's nazi germany!
where is he, donald?
have you?
drink up, young man. it'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
don't. take me with you.
let him go, stan. i can help.
yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
and after about two seconds, i got the biggest hard-on.
here comes the times drama critic.
i'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  i'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  i'm seeing a lawyer.
don't exaggerate.
what's botherin' you, anyway?
ben did this.
ah, now! here she comes.
how much is your salary?
kane?  charlie?  where is he?
before i took the story and closed the case, i'd want to know a lot more about these people.  i'd want to know just about everything about them.
yeah, i love it there.
look man, i just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  i didn't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
no. i'm a marked man, jez. i'm the only one left. i don't want to expose you to that. it's not right for you or me. be reasonable.
larry, i'm so scared, would you please hold me.
come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
they were out deer hunting, right? jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
go where?
oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
what? who?
well of course.
- i told you! he was there! -
here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
okay. now, so he's in jail. he, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. as if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  p.s. he's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  you like that story?
last year was awful rough--mama passing on and the whole business with o.j.--i mean it's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
...you're such a puzzle.  so sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
get this. we ain't partners. we ain't brothers. we ain't friends. if ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
lock fuel rods.
jeff -- huh?
i didn't do anything.  it just happened.
huh? hullo, skinny. snuck up on me.  how do you like her?
pray.  we never find out.
you didn't hear?
po, po, position...? hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
i'm still second best.
this calls for a joint.  you want to do the honors?
i don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
your weapons, sergeant.
ain't he warning up?
i suppose i did.
hiya, ho-jon. you got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. hey, radar!
you heard me - keep away from him
sell?
why?
the average man would go after the reward. all you seem to—
no -- impressed.
different?
it's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  if i take them, i spend the next day stupid as a stone. if i don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
what's that?
it wasn't easy.
don't say that.
we were in love... weren't we?
she witnessed the tuttle arrest - the buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
a.k.a. minneapolis -- st. paul.
deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
that's who people want to rent to. it's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... all we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
as far as i'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
do they know who did it?
take it off.
people were suffering in afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
it's not that i don't appreciate the offer...
yeah?  what's your husband do?
to who?  arthur?  nothing.  nothing that norman doesn't already know.
you said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
ben, i'm afraid i've got to ask --
that's none of your goddamn business, caesar.
it won't stop. it's not ever going to stop.
vodka.
i know.  and nobody can make him.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
i'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. if i can... slide your cuffs free.
i appreciate that.
what for?
oh my god ... ann?
no.
or the one.
i deserve better than this.
who are we kidding? no one's gonna show. we're living in a fantasy!
what?  oh, the flat tire?  yeah, i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
the guy from near where christie used to live?
i know it must of been a bad experience. but it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
it's a common reaction, jim.  i'll tell you what it is, and i know that that's why you married her. one of the reasons is prudence. it's a sizable investment.  one thinks twice...it's also something women have.  it's just a reaction to the size of the investment. monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  this woman can cook...
could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
how to kiss ass.
i'm in love with you!
i was just about to advise the inspector here not to show dr. hudson the note.
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
the mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at lombardi's.  and call me ich.
it got crashed!  i didn't...
--she's not dead---
i do not speak english.
there must be some mistake. you sure you hit the right commands?
you won and was robbed! you didn't do nothin' wrong.
don't you have a maid?
- and left?  of course they'll hear.  i'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but i never imagined that people wouldn't know.
nothing.
do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm?
then what will you say?
okay!  i wasn't sure
ready?  we've got plenty of time.
that was awhile ago.
i understand completely, sir.
well, probably.
it's not okay, i mean we've got to talk now. where are you going?
why no, sir.  i don't believe so.
no.  i don't think so.  i'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. fair enough?
yah, that was different. management was restructurin'--
of course.
well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
big ed’s.
what are they doing to duncan? duncan!
sir, tyler is innocent of any crime against the state. captain rhodes is...
...sod you, stupid twit.
i wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
yes, yes it does...
i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
this is jason's fault!
ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. this is nick's room and uhh....
margo, you haven't heard?
he laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
who ever made that.
more like deployed in bed asleep.
what are you talking about? look at all the honeys.
everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. annie.
a motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than i care to remember and i've been here a long time.
you seem like you're anything but lazy, uncle billy.
what are you doing?
you really think so, charlie?
say the name, or i slit your throat.
no.  please.
get your story straight.  this idiot's been trying to kill me since i went to rekall.  --you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
he should. four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
i knew you would.
you better get in there with her until this thing is over.
then get them out of there.
the only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. so you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  good luck.
yeah?
okay... okay...  i put it down.  now open that door. mister fisher's right on the other side of that door.  he's an actor...
i'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. my name is roger murdock. i'm the co-pilot.
sleep. that's all i need. don't want to waste no time sleeping. you married?
there's a pizza place over on market.
it's deceptively simple.  like a bruckner symphony or a matisse.
you have the power to do it.  i want you to do it.  please.
how about you?
is he here in borderdale?
okay. recommended...
can we charge admission?
father...
who gets contaminated, the jews or the gentiles?
but...
thank you.
in the ship, sir.
tom, the welsh dude --
i decided to go pro.  and who knows where i'll end up, you know?
what are you talking about? he had no more to do with it than you did.
you don't want to know.
i don't know.
pour it in your ear.
no.  there weren't.  there was <u>you</u>. and <u>me</u>.  no variables, no math.  it was actually the simplest thing in the world.  but your head got in the way... like it always does.
ch-charlie m!
that's why we tied him, dumbass.  now come here and see this --
louis, we were french!
it isn't another boyfriend, is it?
well, captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
i don't know. what do you feel like doing?
oh god veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. if i have to sing "kumbaya" one more time...
is there quicksand?
what'd you get?
i plan on liquidating almost evetything.
seen what, sir..?
cover it?
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: the game.  you and i conor, we are different from all others around us.  you know this, you can feel it.  we are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
they want to discredit you -- for what?
bad?
i know you can't stand me to say i'm fat.  like i can't stand you being a bank robber.  i guess that's what love is -- huh, sonny?
she don't know how to box, i bet.  my dad showed me how to fight like ali.
jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
what are they going to do? not invite me to their birthday party...?  look, i gotta go. i have to be in cambridge...
oh, no!
jack manfred.
figlio di puttana. you’re the french asshole who bumped off the london guys...
no, no.
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
you're sure.  find out for me.
the cockatoo inn? where's that?
i told you, there's no --
yeah. i was in nam.
but how, sir?
don't touch me!!
i've got to move. what do you have, kenny?
well, james, you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
fuck him.  fuck murray.  john?  you know?  you tell him i said so. what does he fucking know?  he's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
nay, bigger; women grow by men.
thank you, david ... and a very merry christmas to you all.
tell me about it.
you tell stories?
this press we cannot control. americans, i think.
what's that, like a p.o. box.
i didn't get the bet down in time.
these are worth at least, i don't know --
hello, mimi.
love 'em, helmuth. i give up. what are you holding in your hand?
don't worry, i'll settle up with your boss. we haven't skipped town yet.
what are you doing? you can’t. i...
i admit i don't know where he is.
is that how you remember it?
yes. i flooded my school... and i burned down that pervert's house. i think i only have a few days left... before they catch me.
yes.  i think i <u>do</u>.  i think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  you told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  you <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
captain, the enterprise!
ramona! don't get mia farrow on us.
just get us to the ship!
no.
i know.  but it wasn't all bad was it? in fact, i think you found it quite pleasurable. mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
hey! what's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? and we're going to have fun tonight, right?
you're really twisted, gordon. you're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
this is a mistake. no. this is a disaster.
you don't understand.
"there's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, doc?
died?
<u>that's not the issue</u>!!  ugh!  how can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
i have to obey him... because he saved my life. he controls me and i have to obey him or i'll be left all alone... and i'll never figure out what all of this means...
childers.
looks like you're doin' a good job.
the things you own, they end up owning you.
hey, you're the one who brought up safety. i'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
she's a programmer?
we clocked the t-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
please, hurry...
sure.
you could say that.

the same place.  one o'clock.  i have to go now.  see you tomorrow.  remember, i need you.
a pleasure. pity about bella.
not quite. just visiting. i live in lincoln park now.
i don't believe this... all that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
last time, it was me against him.  i wasn't strong enough...alone.
dozens. it's very sad.
how did it go?
yes,  she's a little odd, i understand.
that was another time.
where are you going?
what do you think of her, honey?
tell me about its sexual roots.
the storms have done everything they can to me, i don't hate them. i don't even hear the wind. it blows beyond me. it was on such a night as this that barbara died.
hmmm . . .
steve?
i said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
fuck maybe... be there.
hudson, i'm afraid i'm sticking with god.  but you're a close second, tough guy.  what is that smile?

a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  you know how many are born?  maybe five. they eat each other before birth! they're born killers!

oh, as beautiful as ever.
why?
that wasn't me.
another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  it's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  you keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
jeeezzz!
you want to crawl, crawl.
not general korrd.
she's up for it.
yeah. i've got it here in this bag. i thought i should bring it to you.

good time, too.  everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after new years'.
where?
no one. i promise.
that's moronic.  why would a bit player impress a backer?
fifty shillings.  pounds.
well, i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka.
we have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
i don't communicate very well through a shroud.
archbishop melker. we met earlier.
tish-i'm-tee.
well, i, for one, like cheese.

hey, i was senior. it's ok. this is why i get the big bucks.
all right, wedge. go for the power regulator on the north tower.
let's get outta here, lou.  i saw too much stuff like this in the war.
do you?
no!
i need to go now.
the most powerful man in america is president nixon, probably you've heard his name.

here--where are you running off to?
she's my friend and you should meet her. you'd like her.
why'd call me a killer?
nothing.
tubbs listen!  i don't know anywhere else to go!  i need your help!
well, i would know. i'm the executive sales manager.
you're a good officer, major mandrake.  you have a right to know.  it looks like we're in a shooting war!
you're doing just fine.
we all got it comin', kid.
and you come into mrs. ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
you got it, sir.
they had a rough life. your father was a bouncer. your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. there was no place for a baby.
did you like it, dear?
i will. how's shelly?
do you recognize him?
...the whole world's out to get you...
i can get you new evidence next week.
he's not plugged-into the system. he's in the fucking system!
deal.
if it's about the posters, i think it's so awful. it's a travesty.
you're the only person i can trust.
surely you can be more specific...
you know damn well i nearly puke when i look at her. i don't even think she's a real blonde.
no.
sure, that would be cool. friends.
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits, volume two.
hellllllllp!!
that's their standard deal, brother. they ain't about to change it for us.
let's let molly open one.
yeah.
-- oh no, honey, i'll do that...
let him have his say out.
we can cut back at the end.
bela, he talk.  loretta, she talk. but tor, he no talk.
ruiz knows about this?
you're fascist, man. neofascist.
boxin'.
so she's uh, flourishing?
was there anything over the hill?
felt like a hydro concussion ... an imperial cruiser.
i didn't want to kill her.
yeah, burt.  the way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive world war iii.
i told you i don't know anything about any fucking set up. i've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! i don't know anything! you can torture me if you want -
that's what she told you. i looked it up at the hall of records. your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, julie james.
i left him because every time i looked at him, i saw my son.  every time i got close to him, i smelled my little boy.  that's why i left him.  and now you can leave.
high end?  honey, it's a whole new budget.
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
you don't know the half of it.
yeah. to see if he could expedite my case. but i wait, and i wait, and...i'm starting to think i'll never see her again.
almost eight. you wouldn't believe how weird i look naked.
then what are you complaining about?  look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "first, the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass. second, the word of god, only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. third, the path of god, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
i feel so embarrassed.
jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  congratulations.
no.
we would have sooner or later.
you mean teach you how to play. can't. going fly fishing in canada, big client...
both at the same bank...
honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  but we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
subways... perfume... cigarette...  ... cologne... carpet... chestnuts! ... <u>snow!</u>
well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. he can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. and his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
were you and my father having an affair?
what happened to him?
how could witwer have accessed the case file?
huh?
i stood alone on the green, searching for something, and i started to walk to the church. but then the darkness closed in, i was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and i fought to wake up...
i want it --
sorry there, old spudhead.
it's in your closet.
we've got about eight or nine prospects	i want you look--
no, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. she's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
a fine bunch of reporters. biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
i wouldn't like.
yeah, well, welcome to the club.
it’s good, right?
must you fight him?
turn on your laptop. set it to receive a file.
you mean besides kicking your ass?!
don't you want to kill me?
thank you, son.
our troops have no part in this.  it has been started by the russians!
very true!
you've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. i'd like to hear what it is.
i ought to know.
you threatened miss swann.

for a *question*.
i'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
you've read the transcript. it's all there.
i called. i never touched you. i didn't leave my name or nothing.
no. have you seen my glasses?
well, that's me.
i hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
--almost a year before he left the justice department--
i didn't.  it was a present from a guy.
no, sir.
alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here? yet tell me not, for i have heard it all. here's much to do with hate, but more with love. why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate! o any thing, of nothing first create! o heavy lightness! serious vanity! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! feather of lead-- [benvolio snickers] dost thou not laugh?
what's up, sidra.
it's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  but he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
shhh.
didn't tell you of what she did?
...good-bye then.
i mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
where?
where is his home, lex luthor? which way?
yeah. are you sure mommy's not home? it's very late.

i'm a writer myself, you know.
oh!  oh, tin man!   oh!
there are cops all over the place.
ebby calvin "nuke" laloosh--
you switched the charts; you tell me.
sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
no, but i passed by it a couple of times. it's out in the middle of nowhere. it seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. and it's open from dusk till dawn. you said meet you in the morning.
congratulations.  then i am free to search for the mainland.
where would she go, anyway.  don't tell me you haven't got her covered.

my name's 
it's got doors, diane. private as can be. tom?
you're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.

only what you take with you.
me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
well, i thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
like last night, veronica?
you don't get it, do you?
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced.  tonight i'm doing superfreak, i don't care what he says.  where is he?
do you believe in love?
i didn't tell you everything.
sweltering.  come on, i'll take you home.
my granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. but he does not want to pay.
i got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the indian nation, didn' i tell you...
all i know is he did it. i am satisfied.
it doesn't matter who we are. follow the tunnel to the end.
yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "epidemic! epidemic! you're all going to die!"
okay, you busted me.
there's the trinacria hotel... or the regina, near the municipal building. as for rooming houses, i don't know...

me?

don't worry.
sure.  too much birthday cake, right?
amado.
well, let's do a special report on that...i mean that's news.
they even killed the galley chief.
jesus, daniel.  it wasn't ryker's island.  it was work camp for white collar criminals.
huh. and here i had a completely different theory.
what?
the lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
there's-there's-there's-there's mr. when-in-the-pink, mr. miami beach, there, you know?  he's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. he placed third.
nobody. you.  i had to tell you, right?
you thought about it too. you've been suspicious for a while. but it's not happening in there. it's happening in the day care.

i want you to stay, okay? i goddam invited you, didn't i?
well, a boy goes like this, see.
oh, they knew.  they had to know.

it is, isn't it? it is your first time.
we make the pick-up, refuel once more in the bahamas, and fly back on sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
i know that, claire.  i, we <u>all</u> know...
we're not going anywhere.
it's gonna be bigger than big. think europe. think asia. they don't have room for real golf courses in japan.
correct. i don't.
but the center of the galaxy can't be reached. no ship has ever gone into the great barrier. no probe has ever returned.
rattling. rustling.
i want to talk to you for a second.
huh?
thank you?
i don't-.
he's nervous, sir.  he's heard you're looking for a new director.
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says. so that's what they built.
they all have one...
no. just the cross streets.
how about what?
he's a socialist, then?
don't let me go!
there's still time to undo this.
- and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
the river.
no, go--
when you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. cause that's what the white man wants you to do. look at you.
no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
i wouldn'tve asked --
and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he's got a little something i think you'll like.
there's nothing around.  nobody's holding.
none whatsoever. please, mrs. lampert -- be careful.
so they'll shoot me -- like a horse.

last time you didn't even scratch it!
he's commanding the detachment at nu mung ba.
i'm not rheya.  you've always known that.

you can't stop what's comin. ain't all waitin' on you.
vader agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me.  they'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
something came over me, i just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  it was pretty hairy.  i thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  but i really can't take credit .  .  .
what you talking?
i... i thought it was great. i loved it. it was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
want to go to butch's for a drink or something?
hey sue. gretsky's on his ass again.

thanks.
not if i shoot first!
well?
i understand perfectly.
ken!
and then what?  then you'll be safe?
no no no, it's not sex!  i mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
sweating like a pig, actually.  and yourself?
sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if i hadn't tol' you.
yeah -- see the fight last night? apollo creed beat that english guy bad.
uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.

this conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before harold was declared legally dead.
let's get out there. and have them run down every 167 shelby mustang in the area ... find out where they're at.
what's that?
i'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
i don't know...
cheeco.
well, i can speak for the emperor. you made too many demands on the royal ear. the poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
how should <u>i</u> know...she's your wife!
sergeant? we thought you were...
you didn't say that about the food?
good night, colonel.  it's been beautiful.
what did you say?
i got drunk.  i puked.  i got rejected. it was big fun.
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  violent?
abort? reed, i put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and i will not let you make me look like a fool --
don't start.
honey - - i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale.  if i had a good enough hint.
yeah - bill - how are you?  you okay?
without the body we have no physical proof. we need a confession.
well, rick, after tonight i'll be through with the whole business, and i am leaving finally this casablanca.
that bad?
where?
forget that guy --
hey, i'm a sacred vessel. all you've got in your belly is taco bell!
what?
what?
yeah? what did they want?
oh, a long time.  because i kept asking my husband where the heck could junior be?  he wasn't around here.  i thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
i'm still thinking about it.
invasion.
yeah.
and is that what you're going to do?    is that what you're going to do...?
what do you mean?  you talkin' about coppin a plea?
three wakes off the back of those boats.  who runs three sterling engines off a deep-v hull?
just relax.
uh, you know, i think i can fake my way through a song.
i'll work on it, ma'am.
they're out of towners... arizona plates...
i came to see merle.
what?
there is a very simple way. got a telephone book?
yeah, me too.
i'll get your bag.
nobody likes garbage -- anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
he's alright, but my dad can take him.
that's why they cheer, you know. the white man sending the black man into battle...
i dig my own graves. green water and the white rabbit. put it on.
hi, son.
we have to get out of here.
i think you're right, keith.
i'm still on course to victoria. nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
what?
is this a bad time?
terrible feature of war in the americas.  best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
yeah, you really showed him, daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
i hate 'em.
uh-huh...
no shit. like johannes brahms?
"embezzling" is such an ugly word, mister bailey...  no, actually i'm trying to get a legal brief together.
virus?
what?
and let's put this together.  okay? shel?  say okay.
god willing.
but "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  how perfect does your child have to be?
keep trying.
my son will be all right. if he isn't, i'll have you killed.
that's going to do it, right?  i'm going to be okay.
it's a mistake, honey. you two go on. i'll walk back to the depot.
yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, i'm not in. hugo you're not in.
i can feel your desire, deanna.
what?
what about me?
surprise!  surprise!
i just need to -- lie down. studio.  daybed in studio.
they were in the same creative writing class.
even pigeons aren't peaceful.
a bereavement. a death in the family.
boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
not the same.
why?
this is it, as far as we can go... if we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. if we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
--she was panicked, carl--every time i mentioned watergate, you could tell.
and what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
no! wait! erik! the cloak! the cloak invisible! it only seems to work on my father!
sure. i'd like that.
i... i didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
i can see that. sure.
bugger off.
ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
he ran away?
-- about what?
if it's on the level.
you're shittin' me.
i'll tell him. where does he live. we'll get him on the phone right now.
yeah, mack?
i'd like to sit for you again.  but only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  okay?
i might.
i don't think so, he should be along soon...
you did something on impulse?
jack... green jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
slipped in. probably liked the scent of your perfume.
i thought you said 'be sorry for nothing'.
you've got a dark side, selina kyle.
very well.
delirious.
i am afraid of nothing.
nice try, old girl. i'd like to help you out. you know, for old time's sake. but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and i haven't collected my profits yet. too bad. you caught me at the wrong time.
i love marge.
listen to me, listen to me...i've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  this newcomer walter paisley has it, whatever it is, the x factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and i want that cat in my hands.  are you listening to me?
the blood transfusion.
has he?
j.m. inc. be all that someone...
'we?'
i'm not here to negotiate.
it comes at intervals.  they used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
but they don't know that.  they're probably looking for other ways to get in.  that'll take them awhile.
faulty wiring.
that if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
isn't it, uh...
brezhnev's coming in three days.  i don't want to deal with them.  and him.  and you.
no! i... i checked when i put my stuff in. i always look through the washer first.
just remember that when you sign for the tip.  they're paying for it, so don't be shy.
go home!
that's carlotta valdes.
that's correct, sir!
until it happens, you're still a human being.
no, ma'am.
there is one.
quit stalling -- i want to see some identification -- now!
you know something about me?
so disengage his flail arm mechanism and just make him a screamer.
so now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? it's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the r stand? i thought i saw you there.
no, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  i grew up here, and i know my way around the studios.
they knew just where to hit us.
fats, let's you and i shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
and it came to life and divorced you. i know all about that. now my idea is this: somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... bingo! ... peddles it to this old skate down there!
i'm not trying to pull against you, cooch. i've just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed.
in aid of what?
i mean it, let's get away from here, first joey then nolan, now charley— and any minute... .  ...i'm frightened— i'm frightened.
then i'll go to your place and you can move in with tom.
normally, i would agree. but in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. you're many things, number one, but you're not much of an historian.
when i last saw you, i was unprepared. i did not know what to expect. in these past weeks, i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  you have to understand who i am and what i am. i am a musician and i believe in music. i am an artist and i believe in art. art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. i must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. my entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because i thought that i could, through music, do something practical.
oh my god, sorry.  i'm interrupting.
your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... all this time, i've never had the courage to touch it.
i am sorry for all my sins.  and yours.
you know, i just might!
i'm fine.
said i speak french like a spanish cow.
they call me in when they've reached a dead end. freelance. like yourself.
got it.
that's where you're wrong, clayton. you've just told one.  a very good story indeed.
you follow your desire freely enough in the night. so, if that is all, to greenwich i go.
i know that you kill people to sell bodies.
yeah, teresa, shut up!  we don't wanna get charlie here in trouble, do we?...we love charlie.
yeah, ford.  i'm okay.
sure, they go back to cortez. when he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
it's not good...
a lot of cakes.
how perfect.
he said something like, "do you want it dirty7" or something.  i tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
i wouldn't be so sure about that. he did it with you. he's a man now.
inside stuff?
something was just missing.
yeah?
i didn't want to eat this much, man.
good for you, lieutenant.
look jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
i'll pay extra
say, who's been tying your ties lately? it looks rotten.
antarctica??
and you do? from the moment he left treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
of course i am.
jee... fuck... you’re fucking mad!
so what are you trying to tell me? i should get out of here?
she thinks he's a pig.
fuck.  basher-basher, this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction. stand by for a prc fix...
no.
-- c'mon, stephen.
jesus christ!
where?
gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
who didn't?  big news.  out of brazil, wasn't it?
not alone.
you in business with those guys or what?  i wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, bern.
yeah, wizard, i guess. i mean do what you think is right.
nobody's seen that.
you'll die if you leave here.
melina!
you got one?
if i were... i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. i would "miss you."
don't worry.  you haven't seen the last of us.
wait a second, whoa! calm down! number one there were five different versions of the script given out. ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. and what, i die in stab 3?
buddy.  that's his given name?
mr. caiman...
here are tonight's calls.
no, it's a very groovy girl.
i know.
okay, okay.
how do you know if you've never tried?
never touched me.
alriight!!  my man!
no thanks.
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
sooner than later.
logging? we'll need an environmental impact study for that...
it's great.  you wanna speak to mary? hold on...
you give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. he will leave you all out there to die.
don't . . . please! please, don't!
andy.  another fuckin'...
i wish paul luck.
all the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- i brought all the papers --
what is it, my son?
now, hold the bowl steady.  back to business.
an accident, nathan.
it could have been anything.
what is this?
what the hell are you doing?
i never said they were boring.
try and take it.
what...?
and i mean... that's no good.
yeah, but i'm not sure yet.
we do.
aren't you?
okay, boss!  but i hope you know what you're doing.
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin.
me neither. but i believe in knowing your enemy.
major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
just a few miles. i'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
it was no big deal.  i saw them leave, i went in.
don't come so quickly when i call. i want you to take these officers...
too hard?! i don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
why do you always focus on the negative? didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
no, lieutenant, your men are already dead.
you should know. she's in your dream.
ah!
i believe i should interview the widow alone.
mother!
and, of course, the u.n. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast.
he's getting up.
i got bangs!
the lord be with you.
won't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
your high school friend who went around saying 'me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. as i remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
i used to be so proud of him. my big deal daddy. and now, he's just a crook. worse even. and the weird thing is...
what tickets?
i want to introduce a couple of people. doc white is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
i just work for the travel firm.
some guys from ninth avenue jumped fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but i think it will pick up.
i have been to the dark side. i have seen a world that no man should ever see.
it means... i see.
are those the only two possibilities?  you wanna french fry?
no.  with hair, yah.  but i must shave head for wrestlink.  it scare da crowds.  dey like that.
metal's crystallized. gotta replace the whole deal.
well, how nice to see you again, elena. you're looking wonderful.
on my way...!
missing what? he didn't say shit.
hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu, i'd tell her to go fuck herself.  why can't she board it?
oh yeah...
gomen nasarei. hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  i'm sorry, my son. you have mis- taken me for someone else.
that's him.
don't wet your diapers.  i'll have to change them.  "witchcraft." what's the running time?
this has nothing to do with any of that --
you do want me to keep the job, don’t you, mrs de moraes?
like most things, i am nothing. it's the same for this sword.  all of it is simply a state of mind.
then lighten up. she'll never know we touched it. alright, here's the plan. we bus it to chez lex, grab the volvo, bail jam the hell outta st. bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to detroit.
what i do know is that whatever he's becoming, sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
i remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
no. it's going to be about a half-hour.
just some young guy.  around twenty years old.  dark hair.
how would you know sh...
would you settle for pepperoni?
he's smart, powerful, successful --
what're you going to do, charlie?
no! i thought you believed in me! it was all a lie!
no, it's not like that.
well, it ain't that good up there neither. might as well make it here. 'course i ain't really makin' it now.
that's who.
activating power beam!
you have some?
and what did he say?
how is it possible?
sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
i swear to you that's all that happened.  i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
thank you.
if i've been there? that's silly! either you've been to a place or you haven't.
hold on a second.
no. you don't understand.
i know. i know. help me, here. look around.
plastique explosive shoelaces.  cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
that's right, mister.  you better be afraid.  i told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  now i find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
i came by the house every day after the funeral.  and then every week. then every other month.  then i stopped coming.  did you even notice?
this is it, james...what you've been working for.
i didn't know we had any women left.
what were you saying, commander, about the bomb?
coming to see me.  are you trying to. . humiliate me?
i guess it's pretty tough work at that.
oh, don't go.
you happy, baby?
you always have been.  we're all descendants of the same stars, ellie.  all made of the same primordial atoms.
what chance is there of getting jeff's interview on the air...?
peter, do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
trying to put it off on her?
across the board, sir.
supergirl?
kennedy.
only were he a fool to boot.  see yon viper?
i know you're her bodyguard.  did she buy it or did you?
no.
i've got you!
and, what a delightful idea!
yes...yes, you have yours.
it's the worst job since keymaster.
just seems weird they didn't chase us.
+ the nose is sharper. smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;and what about the hair? you said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
it has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
i didn't.
what girl, what does she know?  why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
here, take my jacket.
then what?!  what, goddamnit, louise!  where the fuck are you going?  are you just leaving for fucking ever?  what, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
well the other night at dinner...
those aren't guards.  they're valets.
only a week?
green spot.
   we have twenty-one minutes. captain,    we can still save v'ger... and ourselves.
give what up?
what i know, paul, is...  he's going to take you out...
the candelabras were my gran's.
i’m a hooker.
what you got, peters?
then foreclose!
no, no, i see...
i know they're gonna buy that stock --
the answer is never, ted, never. except maybe in your dreams.
i'm game.  sure.
they took my keys yesterday. i went there to get them back.
oh let's not...
so...how's the knee?
you have a map.
what's a mook?
i know where my heaven is.
we are almost out of everything.
not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
it'll be like live television! let's live on the edge a little. you and i can break the mold here!
will do.
nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
i'll take them both.
you're too late.  there was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  but he turned to dust and blew away.  i don't have any power for you to take.
i got a lot of free time, you know what i mean?
no -- no -- no -- no...
the websters!
you know, please, i just wanna say that i didn't say i would help her out; i was very clear about it....i don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
you see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
yes, madame. you see, i have to get up very early.  my little brother goes to school--  you see, mother is dead.
get her started....
what if--
trophies.  you know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
the what?!
well, you know how those millionaires are.  these came for you.
... mmm-hmmm.
would you like me to?
your children?
how do i contact you? we still don't have the atm info.
you're telling me you want out? already? you're telling me you don't want the money? hugo is going off. he smells. the flat smells. we can't wait any longer.
frank.  fuck it.  okay?
what brand'd she smoke?
you better go get 'em.
no.
at you?  polly want a kiss?
that's a good occupation. and live here... alone?
ta-ra.
yeah, maybe you're right. everything else is just an excuse. i'm treating the situation with kid gloves because i'm afraid of losing her.
haven't got one.
lots of things.  her favorite yogurt.  the ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
yes.
don't do this, andy.
yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right, but she did it. she found him.
i see.
no, what i see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
no.
eh-
sure.  face down.  two endearing shots to the back of the head. that's your mark, man.  what did little eddie ever do to...
arnold. what's happening?
all i said was, i don't want to perform abortions. i have no argument with *you* performing them.
just yes? no mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? that frightens me.
my god!  how can you just do nothing!?  they're your friends, your family.  you all knew mara. you ate with her and worked with her... your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
how come i didn't hear anything?
the swan was so ridiculous. all the same, it did scare me.
then we'll do something else.
i'm sure you've examined my record. so you know i've never yet been late on a bridge.
this is the hotel supervisor, mr lamont. i’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
you'll do it, all right. you fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. that's how it works, buster. if you don't do it, i'm going to throw you out of here. do you understand me? if you don't pay auggie what you owe him. i'm finished with you.
i live here.
who?
me first?
they'll have to come right past us.
a tomb?  we're in a tomb?
yeah.
okay.
rain.
i had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  but i never missed a lugosi picture after that.
we play tennis at the club.
i don't know if you can choose that, rafe.
you never dated kathy reynolds!
why is that?
it's not an "alley". i hate when people call it a "bowling alley", it's so common! i prefer "bowling center".
oh, shit, bill, i guess nobody's gonna come clear from texas.
yes, you do. you think i'm a fool and a spoiled brat. perhaps i am, although i don't see how i can be. people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. i never have. on the contrary, i've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. would you believe it? this is the first time i've ever been alone with a man!
judy, i want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days i've had in a year.
i'm-i'm always happy to help you financially.  i think i've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  there's nothing i would--
emma! i will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
bullshit. you ain't got no way out!
right back to you.
give the man a line of credit. he already owes the house thirteen bucks.
no, of course not.
then he's got an ax.  call him anyway.
at least it can't get up here now.
then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, disco boy bashing, warriors of the night!
but we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
he knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. he's been pretending to help you.		    * feeding you a line of crap about john g.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
don't call me dear boy.
how long will she he away?
then you know more than i do -- i haven't even been upstairs.
i'd like to know.  i'll go along.
sounds great.  excellent.  though-, ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the gallery, from england...
it led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. but that left me without any honest means of support.
but you must have something to go on?
what about the house?
christy.
food will be eaten on your time!  why are you continuously late for this class, mr. spicoli? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
okay.
i have to find out what alan wants... that comes first.
fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
you're a peculiar chap.
avionics compartment! it's the only place. you better get zedeck down there fast unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
was i in an accident?
no, you're not.
as in one minus one equals zero yes. where are you going with this?
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
what's all this got to do with me, mr. bartholomew?
they must've just missed me.
but maybe you'd better not.  i've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
what the hell is going on?  i mean what the <u>hell</u> is going on?!!
all of us.
i was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
i am not!
sure, sure. i've heard it before.
i'm glad you stayed.  thank you.
so this is temporary for you?
it's nice here. it's different.
too bad, i liked her.  so, you're all alone in the house of pain?
what were you doing out here?
should we knock?
you're <u>free</u>...
just get back here!
she fucked us both.
i don't want you to die!
yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
madeleine!!
they couldn't prove it.  no body!  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
not at all, mister mcmurphy...
my equipment doesn't crap out....
doyle.
well here is the problem at hand: the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits, and kill him.  as our english rivals have left the catholic church, louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both.  he has already picked the pope.  only the jesuits, who put god above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
i'll be there in a minute. you don't move your ass, right?
this way.  hold it this way.  good.
jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
i'm not fbi anymore.
i recommend it.
i can't do that. not while the joker's still at large.
i insist. it's delicious. just a taste.
no.  i... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
the sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. now what would you do.
i never knowed they was anything like her!
he's better, though, right?
but you didn't do much about it, susie.  you walked out, and there i was...solo...and not too good at that.
all right, all right. but i - i -
where's elias come from?
look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
mother mary, full of grace.
this is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
look, you don't understand.  i need a job.  i've got a kid and--
where's she at?
what? nobody, i-
man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. jackie ain't no criminal. she ain't used to this kinda treatment. i mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in county fuck with your mind.
yes sir.
i'm sorry, louise.  i know you're all upset.  it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house, i guess.  i wonder if darryl's home yet.
i'm too busy, actually. not for the army, of course, but where i live. dr. yamachi's new era pediatric hospital and whorehouse. i'm serious. the guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
you want a beer, ang'?
i probably am, but i don't care. i mean, i wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would i have had time to make any improvements...
where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
see, this is a mature relationship. she's really found it.
what band?
fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
yes.  i'm sure.
i told you, he's one of dino velvet's stock players...
my dad was right! he said you'd ruin her life.
love you! ...well, why don't we turn in?
womack ripped it up, right?
it won't.  it won't, and so we won't.
sometimes. i'm in divorce, mainly. some property. some personal injury.
well, dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
it's not. it's happening to me.
starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
that's probably not the problem, then. what about your lifestyle. any major changes recently?
steve, stop it please...
look, what i'm trying to say --
but you can't think through this one.  you have to feel it.
billy, make sure nyah's not followed.
why?
no. it isn't.
well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved aunt winifred'.
i got him.  i got the son-of-a-bitch. see, i was doing really good up till then. lots of street busts.  i've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  i got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  next thing i know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
you meant it.
what is it you want from me?  some plantation follies?  some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  you want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
she's one of those.  your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
my name's dorota, i'm jurek's sister. oh! you're bleeding.
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
i didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. he owes me.
my son, no one can speak for god.
if we married, we'd shut him out forever.
got it.
i was there. an eyewitness.
yes, he did.
it doesn't matter, alright.  just leave it alone.
it's worth it to me.
and leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
getting your hair done...  would you like to go to a party?
...push this? oh. it's working. hello, martin?
telephone.  i suppose you don't know the phone company killed kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. they control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
pray he's color-blind...
well, we can try...
overruled.
oh, it's coming, it's coming.
i get that impression.
rio, baby!
i ain't sayin' it's right. i'm just tellin' the truth. what was he in the nuthouse for?
you don't love me.
i'd like you to check out this lake.  see--
kenny's aunt?
dr. philby, dr. hartdegen.  i received the most extraordinary letter last week.  from a parent. we are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  they are our employers, after all.  this gentleman's son is in your class, dr. hartdegen.
dance?  you don't dance!  you learn to dance??
hey, i thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
i like you, too.
no marshal, you don't understand. i'm through with lawing, i'm through with the whole proposition.  forever.  i did my duty, now i'd like to get on with my life.  that is if you don't mind.  jesus.  good day now.
larry sellers, a high-school kid. real fucking brat.
i been out of action since i got over here five months ago.
we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
nothing. how's your hand?
what the fuck you talkin' about?
i'm not going to tell you that. i wanted that e- ticket. i wanted it so bad i'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and i'd do the same again.
that's what i'm saying.  why?  the leads.  he's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  why?  we have to go to them to get them.  huh.  ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
sure.  we have no idea what's going on.
i don't know! why are you asking me?  how can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
i can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
hurry, suzette.
'cause adult education's a wonderful thing. you meet a lotta interesting professors. you know, it's stimulating.
i'll go with him --
you're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  that's why you're so tense!  forget norbert. relax.  it's body time.
gladys! stop it!
freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
you know something, molly? i like it on my own. i never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
she was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
never mind -- i'll get it. i have a whole day. i'll be on that train.
so that...???
you haven't been by lately.
for how long?  face it, lee, she's playing both sides.
i agree with you--no gentleman, would--but i would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
where's the majority leader?
uh-huh. why?
so you didn't go to school together.
yes i did. did you hear my answer?
not that i'm in contact with.
i promised myself i wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  i was so torn when you called.
no, wait...
yes, i suppose so. it all helps.
i agree with what you said...truly.
no, i'mma go on to work.  i don't wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it's gonna be different living over here.  don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
i thought you didn't respect money!
yes.
and a hundred mile airspace.
my mom's making my favorite meal tonight. spaghetti. lots of oregano.
there was no thought.  there was no act.    that is not what i am.
you read my thoughts, mr. holland.
weirder than this?
it's freakish.  i don't get it.  i'm not really supposed to touch you, but i can look.
take care, paul.  it takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the president of the news division.
how is central these days?
thirty minutes to break the code... two hours for the five mechanicals. the seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
turkish? oh, if it's turkish, that's different. i want to be in it.
jewels are precious. goodbye, mr. hockley.
where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  it's not...
'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
oh, so i'm disposable?
sounds awful. i guess we better check it out.
chase. hi...
starling -
yes, honey.  i think we both can.
that is of no interest.
say hello to london for me. i miss her.
yeah.
never heard of it.
that'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
no--not today! boy, i feel like a house afire! saunders--how did i do?
play it once, sam, for old time's sake.
i've really got to --
not the window - i can't bear the light anyway - no, i can see all the way to the desert.  i've found the lost fossils.
in new york?
listen to andy, sean.
a hundred and one next month.
i can make it.
he alive to see this?
if we don't try, zordon won't survive!
the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?
it has not been used yet in this prison. the governor has grave doubts about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
did it work?
oh no i didn't!
mr. henry?
about suzie?
ah well. eh, look!
mm-hmm.    seems & lot longer.
you're happy to get a fine?
i don't buy or sell human beings.
well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if i have to make up a loss of $180,000. if it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. maybe you charge too much. maybe you're selling bad merchandise. maybe lots of things. i don't know. you see, i expect to do a lot of good with that money. and i can't afford to put it into anything that i don't look into. that's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. goodbye, and thank you for making me chairman.
my eyes are lighter.
this new learning amazes me, sir bedevere.  explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
we can be there.
we think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. i will see to it that you do not walk about again. i promise you that. there is another one here who can not die. i will watch you both. never fear.
it will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  he will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe.
no, kisses to...
this isn't about us.
well, why is that up to me? you're the one who's married. you told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
i was born in new york city. i grew up. and here i am.
well, i've had it up to my ass with sedate!  you said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
my ballet recital.
what do you think bodyguards are for?
also addison dewitt.
i thought -- is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. no. not my favorite client. she's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
and i never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- but this is serious -- big competition.
...from this creature of god!!!
we're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged blair witch "sightings" --the parr house, coffin rock, tappy creek.
oh?
i just wanted to share an apartment. what was so complicated about that?
okay.
really? the chink, huh? i've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. what else have you learned from the chink?
yeah...
you'd lose.  you'd die.  all over the sidewalk.  and into the street.
what would you like it to be to me...?  i, i, i can't invest in failure.
let’s go.
you want me to show it on my tv program?  well i got nothing to do with that.  you should call up the station manager at channel seven --
yes.
well, see, he's gotten used to being freddy now.  and kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  so...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
i'll bet the butler's name wasn't "jeff."
still no word from star command. we're not that far from the spaceport --
time for a little chat?
ethan, you're not making sense. let me go in and talk to kittridge. i'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
no kidding.  i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
like that?
i'll take you with me.
well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
so?
it's 3+27 hundred
he's an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and i'm lookin' very bad. i can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. why's he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me, i can make it easier for him.
here we go.
i saw a movie once. part of it took place in heaven. everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. like that. at least that's the way i remember it...
yes.
there's something very dangerous about her. something evil...
when she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. i know these people.
you took quite a beating. you must lie down.
it's, it's really nice, paul.
who's captain rob?
very nice.
you can't always tell what's going on there.
i'm sorry.
why, are you famous?
ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
welcome to beverly hills. wife-swapping capital of the world.
thank you.
i accept it. what is suffering?
when she's ready you bring her to me -- i'll show her how.
under <u>water</u>?
i'm a paleontologist.
i am comfortable.
i forgot to wave. we'll have it at the wedding.
will it keep them out?
which?  the one in my throat.
she's a catholic. she says it would put her soul in peril. divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
i don't think that's funny!
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. would you mind if we looked in that bag?
no. i'm just procrastinating.  people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  come on.
look, i...
you getting cold feet?
as if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. what's he gonna do to me?
what?
but we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
roger.  you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
i thought the same thing, right off the bat. that's why we went to see the doctor.  but hunh-uh.  turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
my fucking heart bleeds.
i love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
what happened to me?
christ, we gotta go! the old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
what?
you're not going to let me die, are you!? don't let me die!
this is my jurisdiction. i want these men as much as creasy does.
but honey ...
these we'll pay for.
"no, viejo.  that was josé yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
thanks.
tell me the whole story, walt.
rocky, i'm seventy-six years old. maybe you can be the winner i never was -- your shot is my last shot!
superb.
let's see if they have an address for becker. i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
you are seriously deranged.
he doesn't need the money.  he inherited a fortune.  he kills for kicks.  tv battles between non-predator fish and divers. the diver always wins.
f for...
hi, professor.  what's up?
...stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- be a thinker not a stinker!!
every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
oh, you're going to make life very simple.
if i am your judge, i cannot be your champion. when i act as your king, i cannot be your husband.
it'll spoil our supper.
merci. i... do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
if she's right, and if you don't screw up.
that money is my whole future.
how like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
you are not having your baby in london. you're going to have your baby at cedars in beverly hills, america, delivered by dr. milton cohen.  period. and you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that lamase bullshit.  there's no excuse for pain like that.
bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. he's only a fan, millie. i'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
i'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
ha!!
screw him!
i knew he slept in a toolshed.
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
as if there were any alternative in the matter.  are you enjoying yourself?
let her in, what's the difference? let her in.  no, actually, no, i'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
int. postal van - day.
blonde went crazy. he slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
actually, the only thing i gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to greaseball-land.
it's a simple question.
what's he got against me... i mean, i 'm a teenager. you can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
more than ten years.
what have i done?! idiots.
are you more satisfied now sexually, austin?
you gonna let me keep any of it?
i don't need that, buddy.  i'm not jack kennedy.
that didn't sound like thunder.
birds are not bad!
you went out this morning and bought a gun?
well, when my nightclub career was run over by the depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the orient..." so, look where i got.
about anything.
i see. how do i get down there?
praetor shinzon?
we neutralized anybody with a voice. leo, jimmy... eagle bear. anyone who was standing in the way of the land. is that it?
hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
how you doing?  i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
how much is left?
well, i was just calling to see how you're doing.
pop leibel? sure.
yeah. i see. well--that's about the only thing to do. don't you think?
yeah, we have.  you corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
look!
no you couldn't, sir. this is information retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
just a car.
she can out-run us and out-gun us. but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four.
show them one interesting modulation and they faint. ohime! morbidezza! morbidezza! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
not no more, they ain't.  i quit that acting shit, man.
besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
shit, yeah.  do you know how much money i could make if i had this stuff back east?
had to let her go.  i see you thinkin' there, superstar. don't.
so, you wonder why?
what do you look for?
this morning three soviet agents arrived. i overheard a telephone conversation with mercier, the jeweler. your highness, they are going to sell them!
yes sir.
that's good,  i've never seen anything so healthy.
then you can't come in.
and he use to be such a sweetie pie! what's wrong with him the last two weeks?
he's alive!
no she didn't get your double burger!! it's all fuckin' flyin' fish filet!!
it was there, clear as day. i saw the computer records. matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  i just knew something was wrong.
believe me, it always works. the simpler, the better.
you're not a pain in the ass....
i told you. i have to go back into the past. once more. for the last time.
more people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
shit.
you never played a violin.
sheriff?
hello, copper.  what brings you down to florida?
even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
the thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. nothing. i've always hated her for that.
pardon me?
nicky? oh my god. stay right there.
gilbert!
yeah.
well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
he'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. wait a minute.
why would he send this to helen hudson...
and that's the part of harry that's being manifested.
... looks like a convention.
fine.
only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
i didn't want him meeting me here.
how will you make sure job will be there?
i love her.
no!...
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system. here. this wooten here -- easy, easy. very rare.
yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
i heard your playing.
so it didn't feel... weird?
don't joke around, little buddy. i mean it. i really do love y--
yes. i was washing my hair.
i'm opal.
rough life, jack.
no.
no. just confidence.
joey bevo said it was important. said i had to give it to him myself.
gabriel -- !
i've done much better ones than this.
that's too far ahead to plan.
well - i'm a little confused.  this is a charge receipt from rosen's drug store where mr. marsh had an account.  it's dated the day of the murder.  is this your signature?
it tastes different.
ready.
he can't hear you. he's just a deaf and dumb indian!
this is the first book that i got you.
clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.
congratulations.
i don't understand.
don't do that. please.  or i'll kill you.  please, danny.
if he don't know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
i guess all the suspects are here.
thursday's fine...
i'm gonna save carmen.
i haven't surfed since i got here.
police corruption. it's everywhere.
yes, it is.
what is it?
aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  you know everything i know.  you got nothin' more to learn from me.
5-5-1.
where are you going?
umm. altogether?
i have no idea - i just want to...
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
andy! no!
can't stay, i'm just here because my wife.....
look, jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. it's my show here.  that's that.
would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
claire...
where do you hail from, doc?
i don't.
i must trust you, matthew.  i cannot stop this without you.
gabe?  wait 'til i get over there.  tie the rope so i can come across.
hello, tracy.
i beg your pardon?
and the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
there we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  i'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  so, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
yeah.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
yes. can i - could i help you, in any way?
i don't know. but whatever it is, he's in over his head!
what about christmas?
what if you don't?  then i'm fucked. you see...?  then it's my job. that's what i'm telling you.
i'd like to read a prepared statement. 'while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
i love you.
the only thing is i'm staying at the athletic club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
just the grub box and bed rolls.
but if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
yes, eve?
where is your attacker?
just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. she'll be all right.
a little exercise in lateral thinking. the obvious solution isn't always the only solution... see you tomorrow.
crash, i didn't think you--
sorry to disappoint you.  but rubber lips are immune to your charms.
yes.
laura, no, i'm not. i'm not bob.  poor laura. i wish i could help you.
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the poles. but i'm sure you'll find work, wladek, a pianist like you.
offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? no. i'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. come on, charlie.
and far too aggressive.
one to nothing!
just like we look forward to this.
old woman?
it is my fate to die in the fortress.
how do you know that's the way?
we didn't get that far.
look here now--
i <u>believe</u> you.
like the spearchucker said, that's possible. anyway, it's been an interesting association.
your place?
it don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
dad's home, already?
i've all ready gone six hundred miles... i can't do it again.
crank or glass?
no -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, baron.
karen, i've been with the bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
they should be.  they're both good at it.
there's only one chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are irish and irish people happen to cook cantonese.  they don't know better.
no, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
yes. 
is spanky here?
look, i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  i saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. maybe she saw something.  maybe she was visiting somebody here.  who knows?
you go back, you won't be alone. you'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  you're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. depressing.
ninety-three point four million.
you know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. keeping it real. know what i mean?
what, you gonna shoot me now, bo?
...he's a good man...? he's the prince of fuckin' darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
never saw the point of 'em.
i wanna see that guy!
just felt a little chill.
standing room doesn't cost much. i manage.
okay, but...why?  no offense.
i'm going to pick up some friends of carl's. are you all right?
no. what…?
what?
no, i'm not saying that i wouldn't love it.
stay right.  left is trouble.
i guess you did.
i get the imports.
long enough.
i wrote that.
listen it was a calculated risk. i've done it a million times and never got caught.
come on, doolittle, give it a name.
yes...<i>yes</i>...
you nasty, sardonic--
oh, do you?
yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
tex? you mean he's here, too?
apparently, fine.  he's coming into work.  that's the good news ...
but for wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
so i guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
the first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
he knew.
thank you -- i've worked hard to become so.
shhhh...
i'm quite serious.  you're not here, and neither am i.
why didn't you run after them?
really?
and you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
i shall avenge you --
it is all locked safe in here
maybe... i don't know... but first we have to confess...
pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
what's that, written on the sail?
no speech.
no.
nothing. are you alright?
you get a bad month, all of a...
where are the tapes, graham?
keep it up, then.  keep it right up.
say "mmmerrick."
perfectly.
i like the noise.
sha ka ree. "the scource." "heaven." "eden." call it "qui'tu." to the romulans, it's "vorta vor." the andorian word is.. unpronounceable. still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. for us, that place will soon be a reality.
--fuck anna!
wait here.  if you have to use this, use it.  don't choke. okay?
only one thing, sir... get him off this planet... his aging is part of what's going on around us...
they've all been real times. and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as i have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. soon, the mellowing will begin...
karen, this is sid hudgeons from <u>hush-hush</u> magazine.
you get a call from rose?
why would anyone do something like this?
well, i like it here.
what about bears?
yeah, what happened?
"the sting."
yes, sir.  but so do we.
dead, last time i...
i'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
oh, fabulous.
exactly.  you're a household name now.  you're moving in entirely different worlds.  that's why i hope you're not toying with viktor.
now?
i don't know!
if i could do that, i'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
a distinction worth noting ...
you guys are being real assholes
you going to tell him?
merry, how... oh, christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
0h, shit!
i don't know.  it just woke me up.
yeah?  well, fuck you.  sorry doesn't feed my kids.
the ring?... he was brought to us as is, baron.  i...
call him -- i mean it can wait, right?
what gives?
i am, master shakespeare.
yes. it does.
it's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
look again!
full disruptors.
ten days.  there going to be any back end in this thing?
it's your game.  i've never played this before.
we must call the police, your excellency.
don't be too hard on him.
shut up!  yes, i've calmed down, i'm still not happy about it, but i've been able to deal.
after you, junior.
oh no...
god i guess i'll have to introduce you now.
no. no. i don't have a... no. it was from a client.
what safe place is that?
tough spot.
yeah.
mr. rafferty was very helpful. four cuban-americans and this other man, james mccord.
yes.
what's a long time?
[maybe your men stole from you.]
no.  it's felony possession of marijuana.
of course, jeffrey.
i never left. where's my wife and daughter?
and i too.
i'll need it, sulu.
kate, scott?
i mean my father.
he makes all his money off us black people and i don't see nuthin' but italians all up in there, sylvester stallone and motherfuckers.  ya see what i'm saying, homeboy?
look dixon, calm down! it's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. and it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
it is.  do not ask me how.  i do not know.  i must leave, for if i stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
come on, come on! we gotta keep moving!
i'd like that.
i <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
norma, grow up.  you're a woman of fifty.  there's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
why, how industrious.  and how did you open protected files, may i ask?
did you ever do one on wayne gacy?
what's so funny?
hi.
how'd you like to be married to... the king...?
how do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
such as?
maybe i should reconsider my...
cynthia. john. meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
you do? boys, you're aiming low. you not only surprise, but you grieve me.
hey, can yuh watch the road? watch the --
oh ... i dunno.
-- is often sneered at. are you aware of that?
get dressed, thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
i'd like to make a swap.
so could half the women in here.  and i'd rather go out with a nice can... so watcha here for?  to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
fine.  how's your back?
yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
it may have been maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
and some sandwiches --
dead bodies. the ones in the lincoln are your... associates.
there's nothing to be afraid of. everything's going to be alright.
don't call her mother all the time. it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. what happened to mom?
what about which girlfriend?
how long would you need me?
can anybody hear me!
i shouldn't have left her.
hey, i was told to come here by marcel. you guys don't want me, i'll be more than happy to leave.
burke them?
yes, sir.
xaintrailles...!  don't talk to me about miracles...  if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, i'd be dead now. anyway...
bobby cooper.
what?
who knows, baby?
a pin, neighbor stone! i'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
disgusting.
...since caitlin.  you don't remember this?
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
the youngest applicant by eight years.
because i want justice. i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  and i want to have a little fun.
whenever i get near the water, i see this young boy drowning. he tries to pull me down with him.
you're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
you touch my spleen, rollo.  and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's rollo. he's in vd and he's happy.
mom!
stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; stage three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three. please watch closely.
well, it's for a woman.
that's all i want... it's the only thing i have ever wanted.
somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
xxxxxx
it wasn't- i'll bet you it wasn't. because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
what about it?
look at all them other fighters. real good boys. good records. colorful. fight their hearts out for peanuts -- but who cared? nobody. they got it shoved in their back door. nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
i don't know what you're fucking talking about.
dickie did it.
no.
you don't even know his name.
look closer.  do you have anything to clean it with?
i got someone who's anxious to talk to you, mr. mason.
he'll have it good. some day.
each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
don't be ridiculous!
oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
listen to me. your mother must never know. never.
if not?
the chief-inspector thought you might need a hand.
no, i don't hate it.
a fed? is he close?
what about julia?
oh, it's okay. it's just not something to be ashamed of. maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, i'd give it, say... a two.
from all i can get the sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
please understand. if you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. i'll get you to your ship. i promise.
wasn't my fault...
just had one.
it tastes old.
do you like it?
yeah.
... you know me?
what i just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
peters and i will search the forward decks. justin, take engineering. no hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
no, i do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new buicks?
i figured, what the hell, i could take the prick's money and make sure faith was ok at the same time.  do us both good.  right?
come with me.
different.
you know dr. mason's son, jeffrey mason, don't you, james?  you met him in the county hospital six years ago.
right, chief.
what friday?
and a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
it must run in the family.
goodnight, benjamin.
she's driving me fuckin' crazy.

he's been acting real strange lately. he won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
i don't want your "women," you brainless twit! i want to be well!
i can quote it fully, mrs. redi. "we will avoid violence. for once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."

let's go, sonny.

well he's handsome and he's charming.  he's all right.  for now.  don't say it, i know, i'm rotten.  i can't help it.  i've tried to be good but it's too boring.
no, it actually fit quite nicely.  well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
is that all you ever have to contribute, van patten? "what about fucking dinner?"
it's not over.  you made one mistake.

"mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."

yeah. probably not.

sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up.
so, relic, you want to open pandora's box, do you?  see all the mysteries exposed?
he's dutch. you can't even speak dutch.
well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
has anybody offered to buy it?
i feel like a princess.
we let lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
ma...
well, call general mcaddie.
nobody's gonna do that, mr. connell. they can't use the john doe clubs for politics. that's the main idea.
i can't believe it— a small fortune.   you can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'bye, edie. lord have mercy on joey. 
what's this?
yeah, sure.
good girl.
i saved your life is what i did!
must've been after we got engaged.
nothing to it, really. claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. they got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
huh? oh. great. she's great.
i don't know.
been years since i fooled with that.  you know a white girl? dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  is your lady beautiful? since i came to visit from the country, i have not seen her close. tell me, is she beautiful?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. so in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. that's those little bar codes, you know? the universal product codes?
i'm sorry, sir, but as far as i'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
no, thank you.  tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
i can't do that.
drew!
are you sure?
you were meant to  you're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. you go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
then i'll tell you a story — a lovely story. do you know the story of rapunzel?
you're right.  i can't stand that bastard.  sorry.  this is something new.  not the same guy, that's for sure.
no cursing in this house, young man. use the strong vocabulary god gave you.
can i see your i.d.?
please, could i please come in and talk to you for a minute? maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
have you done your homework, honey?
yeah.
it is bad.  it's chump change.  we might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  we're getting screwed.
if you like 'em like that.
your hair looks -- well fabulous.
excuse me, sheriff. as we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. we didn't kill anybody. now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in new york.
oh.  yeah.  they... make me take this stuff...
damn, that's a long drive.
it's too big.
the hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. i'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
goodbye, charlie.
... i don't want to talk about it...
i wish it had never been invented.
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
what?
and you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
hi. hi sandy. i'm sorry to bother you, but i've got to talk to you.
that's a very wise deduction, general.
victor, are you feeling alright?
yeah. i think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
what stinks so bad?
i think we may have found our mexican drug czar.  it's this general, salazar.  at least i'll have somebody on the other side i can talk to.
her life is in your hands, dude. and report back to us as soon as it's done.
louder.
a recent acquisition. we’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. an easy living indeed, mr lombard.  i got through to moreau and jane. i left your landlord out of it. your flat’s been broken into. jane wants you to call her back.
this doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
we wait and i'm a dead man. i got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much i hated west -- my court martial will take six minutes. it's either me or them, ray, and you gotta decide right now.
i can do anything i want... and so can you...
then how did it get into his body?
and when i'm ready, i'll say the words, 'go see the jew.'
would you like some?
nothing.
i can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
he's going to be ashore with you.
you're not going to blame this on castro, are you?
well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
no.
everyone you know is lying.
dead in a ditch? drunk in a bar in mogadishu? who knows?
i was hoping we could talk.
justin?
that's not fair.
well, how the heck are ya?
i'm sorry, lee.  why did she leave you?
i don't know. i personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
i'm so happy you're happy.
cut that backsass!
yeah.
i'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
other people can't.
will you shut up!?!!
why?
fine. how'd it go out here?
um-hum. very good. excellent!
yes.  you know, that's not a bad idea.
i am so glad to meet you.  we are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...i, you know, they had c...i'm, <u>yearly</u> i redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
what's to stop you? saunders will help you with it--
are you board-certified in anesthesiology, doctor?
on a train. he said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
no, surprise, i thought you'd be--
i want to, bembry, but i can't.
so we'll...radiate some more?
don't really have the market for something like this...  i can go two...two-fifty.
what?
to kill and be king, is that all?
yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. it really is the curse of the sequel. the billy/stu thing’s been done.
she ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
no, we're just...
oh yeah? what was happenin' there?
no.
better.
needs lubrication. lubrication.
who is she?
come on, tell me.
uh, i think so.  in the mental hospital.
naw man, that's some serious shit.
i think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
the book! the black book they found at hamunaptra! imhotep wants it back. said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
you mean you've actually begun some?
in the bathroom.  danny, can you get them for us?
are you his girlfriend?
all part of the business.
no.
if i've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then i do apologize.
you can ask.
i hate that word.  it is a return. a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
that's what josh and mike said.
who told you this?
that's fine with me. keeps me out of trouble.
so the defendant was encouraged to hope.  or could have been.
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
what are you doing here?
if we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
no, i don't mean you have to. it's just that we may not have enough --
all right.
baby, relax. it's just down the hall. she's gotta change... we'll be fine.
i don't know. always wanted to be a criminal, i guess. just not this big a one... takes all kinds though.
still clear.
don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  we've had a lot of trouble.
she's like this high, dark hair, skinny
this may be a very good inn for germany, but it would not pass in old ireland.  corbach is only a league off, let us push on for corbach.
what happened? the pressure got to you?
it'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
what -- what sort of action do you mean?
what about the route to the core?
i see...
i'm not going out there! let's wait for the real police...
it was perfect.  the harder i pushed, the more you pulled away.
well if i was looking for a victim, i definitely wouldn't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would i ask for ransom? you??
you would have done the same for me.
fuck you. you a hoto.
i'm off it!
i'll throw this out. precautionary measure.
is that unusual?
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences. goddamn it! even nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
well, i'm sold.
forget it, doll.  after all, you work here - i work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
are you sure he's dead?
daddy help!
other people?
i know, master, but...
say, fella, i understand. i can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  you want to be rich, right?
it's under control.
yeah?
what's this?
again?
little sons of bitches.
that's slavery and murder.  you don't know these people.  they're just like you and me.  they're nice people!
no.
once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
oh, and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  an architect.
her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
no thank you.
i've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
i know how dna works, erin --
you wrote it.
i take five hundred.
mister laplante...
i'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
they say we must pray to their evil god. we say we will not.
well...  so long as you know what you want, mitch.
our work?
i'm talking about old satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
i said to him cary you're being ridiculous. you're more than half her age. he said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
oh.
yes... leaving immediately.
nobody likes a snoop.
yeah, well, if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
certainly!
yeah?
what are you talking about?
write!  let's just not talk about it anymore.
i haven't seen him.  he probably came in through the south entrance.
jerry maguire.  smi.
maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
everything is not fine!
whatever.  and i thought, please god, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  and he did. she told me the name.  granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
gimme a break.  i'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  is that going to hurt him?
dad, it's not about that. i just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. or at least for a few years.
i just want to watch it, okay?
what did albania ever do to us?
me?  wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
and what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  not a bad thought, eh?
she's asleep.  i think that's what i need, too. i'm starting to see things.
buzz, i would love to see you try.  'course i'd love to see you as a crater.
hell naw, willie. them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
but john hasn't got any.
adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- linda. linda. calm down.
happy anniversary, baby.
hey, wait a minute...
twenty-eight years.
hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? i'm trying to get something accomplished here.
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
can you lift the furnace.  i need money.
no -- that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit.
it happens, right...
for me? and what am i supposed to do with a paper bag?
fair hair, sir.
aren't you going to drink your cocoa? it's the good kind.
i don't know about that plantation angle.
uh, wrong picture tony.
hello walter.  i want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. i've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
yeah.
carbon dioxide?
there is only one solution to your problem, mrs. tasker.  you must work for us.
my client has ruled that out.
look! just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! that's the only way you're going to live.
open it.
why?
you're right. i didn't tell you that.
but i don't play anything.
and now....
you idiot!  you'll kill us both!
why? the guys is ready to deal now.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
she threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. how do you explain that?
fuck 'em. their loss is our gain. put the money in the safe until we hear from claremont. <b>
what kind of ideas?
hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
i'm all right thx rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. at the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "level 842con g, division of plastic, vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
well, i was born to be a mother. some of us are.
his or ours?
kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
i come from a big one.  nine of us. all in minnesota, except me.
broke is more like it.
then, what <u>are</u> we, drew?! the <u>winners</u>? "ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel..." excuse me, i'm not your lover. i'm your care partner. fuck!
it's good exercise, mom.
up and around?  soon?
don't you know i'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
why would you call me from my front porch?
temple, i caught your act the other night and -
no... not yet.  he's very shy... and very sensitive.
no shit?
word is, while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city.  and, right now it's making a cross-country journey to hollywood, u.s.a.
i'm already dead.
evie has a little something for you.
what?
here i am, my angel.
i never had good footwork.
yes.
oh hello, where's dickie? how are you?
you white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. those are birthing hips. more cushion for the pushin'.

i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland--

tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
it's about atlanta and birmingham.
"beg to differ?!"  hey, i'm talkin' about my duplex in burbank!
we're old friends.
so do you.
we're coming!
how's it going?
our prayers have been answered, turkle! our prayers have been answered!
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  and of course 
no, listen. he's a very good hairdresser.
your father would know. your father did know. look. he made a map.
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich, prokofieve, and myaskovsky.
so if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
`thanks for doing this, ellen.'
30.55. twenty more will get you back.
sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
went home to shit.
yeah.  i guess.
so do you.
at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
it means killing benes...  and for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  damn it to hell!
what!
not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
will you guys relax?  we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.  the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
but i thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how i come across?
i wanna close up soon.  c'mon, let's call her.
what if i went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
you mean a woman?
there's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. you ever hear that one?
you're fired.
do as i say.
and live in what, our station wagon?
it usually is.
the donor.  maybe he's alive inside the game.
get the gun.
is that a blessing, reverend?
can i tell you something?  can i tell you a secret?
carl never lied.
please!! no!!!
so that's it? you don't ever want to see me again?
soho.
the water will still recycle.
i don't know.
it's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
no. i was calm.
ain't gonna collect your pay?
he was pretty drunk, but i think he’s still crazy about you.
thanks.  i just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
why, they won't either. she looks pretty. and i wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. don't listen to him, rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
just a second.
will you stay here for the night? you can leave in the morning. that's when my parents get back and --
i've seen it before.
and i thought i was the mindreader.
why should you think i wouldn't be?
with that coxswain dickhead.
i don't know. i want him to lock me up.
no thank you.
i'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  we've had some problems.
pull up behind that car.  okay for this one. take 'em through.
just like that it's all over? with less than two weeks to go, you're out?
forget it, mookie.
the american embassy.
keep going!
check this out.  gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything.  then the wall goes down.  no more cold war.  and gregor is out of a job.  no apartment, no special stores with western food and video tapes.  i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  and i wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
oh, did i hurt the little girl's feelings? well excusez moi... i confess my desire for adm is quite "intense". so i deceived you and our poor friend terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "the great cure for lycanthropy!" hmph. he didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of adam, until it was too late. and even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if i would be just as shocked! ha.
i did look, charlie, but i--
what's your favorite movie star?
you think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
cancer.
did you hear me?
'how i did it.'  good title!
do you like the way i feel?
no. do that and i guarantee you'll scare him off. i don't want him running away.
uh-huh.
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
well, tell the asshole to shut up.
nothing.
what is it, dwight?
i'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  i'll join you as soon as i see my father's physician.
understood.
i usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
i'm gonna sell the other two tonight. this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing. and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. so i'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. only problem, i ain't never dealt with these koreans before. now i ain't worried. asians are by and large real dependable. they don't want no trouble. you might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. but i got me kind of a rule. never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. that's why i need you, backup.
why it gotta be about jungle music and africa?
i did not mean to weep again. why should i weep for joy?
where did this come from?
lucky throw, fire boy.

i'm okay.  look, it's a big house. we needn't disturb each other.  i can shoot a pistol!  i'll sleep in the stables.  i don't care where i sleep.  i don't sleep.
can't see a goddamn thi..
sandra bullock. you know her?
yeah...
everything in moderation, clerval.
we have to find kittle.
oh no.  i really like it sometimes.  and if it weren't for him, i wouldn't have met you.
fuuuuuck
i had the dream again.  and i got another call.  this time he spoke.  he said "you and me, you and me."
where do you think i've been?  i took the baby for a stroll in the park.
[where are you coming from?]
is lois still here?  i'm starved.
shut up!
i'm on my way back in. over.
ok. let's get her over to your father's.
huh?
...were you?
where is he?
yes.  it's for your protection, sweetheart. you're the one with the -- the...
really?
me? are you kidding? why?
i guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  and if you get mad at me, i gotta give you flowers.
and i'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. i'm talking about a great white.
he filed half of them, he filed the big one.  all the little ones, i have, i have to go back and...ah, fuck, i got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  i mean, talk about a bad streak. that would sap anyone's self confi... i got to go out and reclose all my... where's the phones?
we went to the parking lot.
so it's almost a retroactive decision. so i could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her.
engaged to render an opinion.  for a price.  is that correct?  you're being paid to be here today?
yeah.
lovely bouquet.  after our last case, vince took me out for a draft beer. as i recall we split the check.
listen, forget the shoes.  i'll just take a cab... uh...
it was yellow.
you don't want to hear about it.
i never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
i may spill something.
because it's murder we're talking about. aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
what do you mean? you said you liked it.
i prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
alex, it's just the zoo.
what'd you get?
you're welcome.
sooner is better than later!
the crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  with my own cuffs.
hello everyone.
sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
i just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
his name was swifty?
the elevators are still runnin'.
what, humperdinck? humperdinck. humperdinck. ooo-ooo, humperdinck
mr. malkovich?
we loved each other, do you mean that?
well adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
hi.
fuck, ok.
i will, mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems i've been wrong about that.
who was she?
you and i are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  he wouldn't just stop.
you go to hell.
you've made a considerably wise decision.
because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. it'd be too simple. i probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
jesus, i hope i'm not interrupting you again. i heard you walking around in here.  figured i'd drop by.
i really didn't get a good look at her.
he gave me a great deal.
a girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  what's new and hot in gotham city?
approximately two meters long... cylindrical in form...
me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass.
can't kill another one.  can't.  can't kill my friends anymore.
pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
beautiful!  i've never seen that coat.
let him go.
double.
there you go.  love you.
about what?
shut up.
panes is not on your team anymore.
how can you possibly?  i've got to get right on the plane.  i'm leaving now.
i would like to.
they never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
hey, how ya doin'?
easy, huh? hell, i don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... i could see shootin' 'em...
yeah, judgement day.
not yet.
what a brilliant diagnosis!
we'll send you the release forms, ted. our staffers will help in any way they can.
i signed-up for the stock option.
fine.
and you're working with him?
oh.  that's alright.  then i'll come back at a better time.  what would be a better time?
all right.  enough. look...
no.
i know.
yes i am her brother, he's the son
i most certainly do.  he happens to be an old friend of mine.
i'd tell you if i knew. but i'm not in this.  ask the police.
no, she wasn't my sister.
i don't think so.
mueller and childs. one of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
did you just propose to me?
no...squatting out there at the holiday inn like a couple of vultures. he really thinks rachel's going to go back with them. her and ellie.
i don't *have* any time. there's a *war*!
have a good time. don't make it too late.
you'll convince her. you have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
er, yeah, sure, i'll have 'em.
no matter how often i see guns, i still can't get used to them.
nick, we don't know where sal is... nick, angela won't tell us.
can you name all the members of the cabinet?
no.
i'll be o.k. just leave me be a while.
and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
why?
not yet. this time they're waiting for you.
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door, i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
why are you feeding him? why don't you just kill him?
how can you, how can you say that?
what?
zerelda, it's no coincidence. the railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. nobody sells. then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
i'm sure i don't know, freddie.
we can't spare the personnel.  we've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  that's why chaz left us on board.
deploy the weapon. kill everything on that ship. then set a course for earth.
i won't have to.
do what?
he says, "what's your third wish?" and the guys says, "i-i want you to beat me half to death."
i'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
who? i mean besides the fbi?
five stories, straight down. there was no blood in the body.
...get the hell outta here already...
i wanted to call.  i couldn't.
very good.  you ought to have that printed up on your business card.
no, it's not that.  i ... can't drink from the bottle.  i ... gag.
max, i'm gonna fight you on this. the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  so --
you watch the draft this year? 'course you didn't, idiot question. they try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, i wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
fuck you for asking me that.
...goodnight, rocky.
you know, i like that suit, bobo. i don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
please.
and when is the next lesson?
no, thank you.  i'll walk.
dave, you know that's where this road leads.
a bad one.  it was the only book in there.  norman, come here, look at this.
how old do i look?
maybe.  if i come visit, we can find out.
and mr. hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. he'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to new york and do shakespeare with the boy wonder.
then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
that's very tempting, but it's impossible, i'm afraid. wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. you see, they're all originals.
you must listen carefully:  the fire department will be here soon. there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  as shelly webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
let me ask you something else.  at the excavation site in scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
grissom, your message acknowledged. will advise... out.
well, i notice you don't seem to have any close friends at millard. you seem to be kind of a loner.
was that you laughing?
i don't know what that means.
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
you're losing your temper!
whoopie fucking doo.
johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
i don't eat junk food.
oh, hello.
you'll read it in class tomorrow. surprise me.  anyway, i have to go. i promised melinda i'd help her with her oral.
that was a long time ago.
huh?  oh, i'm not worrying about her - i'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
we'll convince them.
yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. anyone not ready for this?
yeah.
yes. come in.
when were you least happy?
first of all...
okay. i be back a little later.
why'd you jump?
you're right. good.
if you do, mr. norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! excuse me.
i figured that out.
he's already there.
from? from? from?
yeah.
honestly ... no.
what?
don't tell him --
or i won't.  i can't help her.  i'm out of my depth.
-- he says the maze has been changed. i need to know for sure.
not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  it is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
i'll take that under consideration, your honor.
these chairs are in good condition. with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
where are you going?
john, you can't help her now.
i made a decision, because i have to consider the integrity of the scene.  i can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
get it, please.
fuck you.
and she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
heil you know who!
my dear stanley, a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? yeah, i'm vaguely familiar
i'm home from school. my father's in the hospital.
oh, mine! thank god.  actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? are you a friend of alan's?
i hadn't planned on it.
hah fluck, great video, huh?
year ago, i come in here on credit card fraud, but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my dunn & broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
i don't know yet.
oh, you must be the brains then. that's right, guns that fire shot . . . make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. there will be a load of guns, that's all i want. i'll pay you when you deliver. everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
we bring her in for questioning.
of course. hi, junie --
my what?
weird? if this happened last month it would've been weird. now with... the tv and... now it's just too weird.
i know you don't.
why's that?
i do not.
we've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. we've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  i'd rethink that.
how much?
whereas you are.
you didn't have to kill sophie.
around one.
they were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
we're family, caesar.
i'll be down in a minute
and --?
he doubts me.
birdy, i've been doing a lot of thinking. there are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. life has dealt me some bum cards...
who am i?
better than one.
mhravitch.
i didn't know you had a price on your head.  vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
we don't know that yet.  it's much too early.  there's a lot to be done.
the moon is too round of face, methinks.
are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
oooh.
no it's mom.
you can put those in my box.  i'll look at them tomorrow.
'booby traps and improvised antipersonnel devices'!
shouldn't i go?
good morning, bill.
oh, there's a hard tale, jack. most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
so there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
int. u.s. research laboratory/storage area/freezer vault - night.
i'll risk it.
oh, your father ... a powerful jedi was he, powerful jedi.
yes, but... i thought...
pay no attention to it. they're just trying to rattle you. it's all psychological. sit down..and drink.
why? i'm paying for this.
so where do we start?
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
no.
uh huh.
there's no call for that language-
got anything to drink in there?
see that sign? it says 100% money back guarantee. do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? do they teach you that here? give me my money back.
oh.
nell, the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
you're--you're old friends of harold ryan?
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
he's got a new place at burnham.
boy--if i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
nah, sounds too "needy."
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
oh, my god.
this is a crime bill, shep.  killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  besides, shep, i told you...  i don't shoot babies and i don't kiss guns.
and your father?
she said that?
even if they could they'd be too shit scared. they have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
no idea.
well, i can't reach them.
uh, almost.
i'll tell you how come.  the barrack chief gave them the green light. and you, our security officer, said it'd be safe. that's how come.
i swear...
said.
i don't know. i can't really tell from here.
scully -- listen to me. i'm going home, then i'm booking a flight to dallas. i'm getting you a ticket, too.
yeah, they call me dar-...
why don't you leave this alone? let everybody think it's over?
it's the hair!  it's to do with the hair.
maybe a political operative of some sort--
...'cause every time i try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
oh! my god! 
tell me about it, please!
i'm glad bill's back.
anything?
coffee, mike?
okay.
yeah, a toon.  it was the guy who killed bambi's mother.
what's he up to?
but what?
jehuda, give me something to do.
may i be present?
but --
no, thank the lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
indeed.
c'mon, babe! you know what i like... easy!
i have.
susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  well, i'm sorry, apology not accepted.
yes, i did.
naturally.  are you claiming, mr. garrison, that mr. oswald also had dinner with me?
shit. i met her on the plane and i had all that acid.  you know, those little blue barrels. i gave her a cap before i realized... she's a religious freak... jesus, she's never even had a drink.
your brother.  will you come with me?
they're enormous! a new species created by man's recklessness. that's what i've been trying to tell you, i'm only a biologist. i take radioactive samples and study them.
all right ... send them the guard.
what do you mean i got money? i'm as broke as you.
and i say maybe you both have it! one more time, dyle -- where is it?
any faster and it'll turn into a flying cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
um-hmm.
whatcha predicting -- your boy goldwater going to split the party?
i'm afraid so, mister presient. being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
i wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of santa's workshop? we've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
there are things you don't have. research materials... i could speak to the chief of staff...?
no, you wouldn't -- you're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- but now let's talk about your affairs.
you see what i mean?  you're being defensive.  isn't she being defensive, bob?
life! -- mr. kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time.  what about the hit list.
no, and i'm not looking for one either.
it's the truth, jake.
well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, george, have we?
oh --
i don't know. i better get off now.
nobody else is going to know it was us.
my pleasure.
thank you.  would you like the man's name?
when can i see you?
oh, yes, i remember -- and i should have slapped mrs. teasdale's face when she told it to me... i'm going right out and find trentino.  you go right out and get yourself an army.
i don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
just two. so far.							  *
what?
i ain't playin' that.
that's not right.
what?
miss cartwright, what is it i can do for you?
he knows you shattered his violin.
shakespeare was french! the queen mother sucks cocks in hell! shit! fuck! piss!
just want to talk to him a second.
no, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
a jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? you're insane.
say the words, "i understand."
...at the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through sleepy hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
uh, can i have the other one. the one below this one. they show more in that one.
good. then call him back. and call me back. don't worry.
iíve got a shadow.
it's one in the afternoon.
what?
that's right. two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. now that one is back...  ...i have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  search him.
you've got a <u>phone</u>?
i don't know.  this is a new disease to me.
home.  <u>home</u>.  <u>home</u>!
are you out of your mind?
we'll come across him tomorra, i guess.
you can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
he looks great, just great!
just help.
i read, cooch.
no.
ernie, i'm a rich tourist today. how about driving me home in style?
yes.
fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. he just wanted to fix their cars.
nothing. i've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. you've got one haven't you?
but we did want you. it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. we knew you needed a real mom and dad.
we don't know which buick, do we?
no. they occupy the fortress, but they cannot control its movement. it is moved by fate. and, sooner or later, fate will place it near us.
will you just relax, mon? he's not gonna kill us. my father is a television repairman. he's got all kinds of tools. i can fix-this car.
been to any good diners lately?
david!
oh, do not go
trying, sir!
whatever.
how's your star?
you better get used to it. that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
thank god this plate was already fixed.
it's - all over -
i do. some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
that's a lie.
sorry, sorry...
no, ma'am...  mama, i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is, so me and sounder can go see him.
thanks for the thought. 
well, i used to live there. i used to live there for years. you know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
you knew that i wasn't before, didn't you?  why did you stay with me?
she pleaded so to do it
so what is they have enough to shut us down!
exactly.
h'm. this appears -- i say appears -- to be properly drawn. but you shall not have this man! a man isn't property! mr. stone is an american citizen, and no american citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
you're a beautiful big animal.
"insane?" the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. the event horizon could be there in a day...
this.
he's important to my business.
i wouldn't say that. but at least you've put the camera to good use.
but that's okay, liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. i'm just an unemployed musician.  you have every right.
thank you, ben. the garden that i left was such a place. everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
oh, you want to -- hah. i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. they hate this tower. they'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. and you should hear the way they commune! sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. no, i don't think you
sure, anything but this english.
... what does that mean?
hand me a towel.  i'm getting out.
on the phone i told him i have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. i could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. walk out and call the sheriff's department.
it's crazy and dangerous. my god. i shouldn't have told you.
well, i don't like to see you mope.
really?
oh god, just get it over with.
you're injured.
take my number.  when you see me -- call me and i'll walk you through the exchange.  it's 308-9962 -- repeat it back.
sure, what have you got?
where's my pill...?
this is friday, her riding lesson is on tuesdays.  i got it right here...
yes.  the cops.  no.
you ever been strangled by a single hand?
that penguin last night, is he one of them?
oh god, bruce. you're still jealous.
no i don't... i keep asking because i feel fat.
don't flatter yourself.  i always liked that line.
don't worry, janet.  brad'll probably get just what he needs.
there are no coincidences, sam. everything's connected, all along the line. cause and effect. that's the beauty of it. our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  this whole buttle/tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. bye bye.
always wanted to see the upper lines.
i had an accident.
and whose fault is that?  if we'd won in vietnam ...
what did he mean by huxley?
that's a good fantasy, though. kinky, but good.
me?  i'm just a customer here.
whatever.
thanks!
i don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
nexus designated mary:  incept november 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
we surrender.
looks like...the optic nerve. i can see out!
i'm afraid this is all for the moment.
i just gotta talk to her, t.j.
it would be the beginning of the end for my family.  how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
two.
did the deceased ever threaten you? were you in fear of bodily injury?
he's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
no. i don't.
this tie doesn't go with blue!
oh sure.  that's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "goodnight honey.  don't forget ot say your prayers. oh, by the way, your father and i torched some maniac last night."
...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
--torn down in the name of convenience--
is he? strange, i mean?
aye, sir.
there's a sand barricade up ahead; i'm going to ram this cab into it. the cab has an airbag, odds are good i'll survive.  but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
what?
come on. let's go.
checking my pulse. it's elevated.  you enjoy frightening me, don't you?
that's when we'll do it. and we'll need every single day.
how strange. and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. only three people here. you're sure?
matt, come here!
what? what've i done?
she left me. crabs.
how about straightening up the living room?
think carefully, wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as privy councillor or vice-president.
well, why not a little of the king?
but she was an attractive girl.
at least i've stayed true to myself. which is more than i can say about some people.
oh yeah...
i think everything's okay here.
...can you cure me?
ah ha.  you finally want to know about women.
no shit -- hot damn --
the mamma's there too.
well!
hair on her hand. plus jen- nifer had raven black hair.
let her go, craig. i mean “him."
how did the car get back here?
you looked okay.  joint's pretty dead. how 'bout i take you home?
well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
that's a nice name for what you need...
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie, too?
okay, i have a confession to make.  but you aren't going to like it.
certainly not at my happy home.
this could be bigger than "amos and andy."
mind if i have a look?
it's in your play.
yes, baron.
you have to come.
yes.
the other day....
i'm a bad shot. i don't think i can --
no, dr. grant says...
i'll tell the cast ahead of time. what do you say?
yes, monsieur.
lemme see that.
yes. shut down and locked by the attorneys.
oh, really?
you are pretty naive if you think it is.
not testing.  <u>using</u>.  nukes are passe.  this is the weapon of the future.
is it gerry? 'cause i don't think it's fine with you. give him time to figure out what he wants.
yeah, he's still up there.
forget it. you can't even set foot in the parking lot. that's how serious it is.
i didn't follow you.
know where we're a-goin'?
uh-huh. look, this should be skintight.  bright colors.  red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! we find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. what do you think?
a scary dream?
did you see it?
you've no right to do this to her, mr. cluett. why don't you think it over? it's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
a wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... there is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  what's your name?
but what is this -- why?
against your code?
sassy my foot! i'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. all we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
hi.
it's you, norman.  your fear of drowning.  you have to face it.
i'm really lost.  what does this have to do with walking?
coulda been a contender.
it's a strange world isn't it? do you know what building the woman lives in?
alone tonight?
oh my god, jim. jim, that was so --
i don't know, sir.
the american people put me where i am.
no, no, we decided!
my father talked about a lot of things he never did, and i'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. i'm just trying to reconcile the two.
no.
he thinks i'm guilty, doesn't he?
what are you after, pam? you want to fry me? you want my desk? is that it?
i'm going to the store. you need anything?
you are a multi-media magnate. the tycoon of tits. the baron of bottoms.
turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
someone must've pulled the records.
there are notices going up. the city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
mr. spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. you're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
and everyone looks like us?
we're watching the movie, harry. you got that!  we are watching my fucking movie.
come on.
yeah.
what did you say?
yeah, i'm 'bout it.
if you kill tonight and i'm in jail the police will know i'm innocent.
sir, that's not true! i love my country!
that's the point, hank.  no matter how good they are, they're still mickey mouse.  everyone's tried. everyone's failed.  it can't be done.
i'll cancel the reservation,  i found the name "zuul" in ...  the roylance guide to secret societies and sects.  i don't suppose you've  read it.
are you arresting me?
no, mom, i've turned it into dad's office.
what i have to do.  screw the annual.
the...
listen--
cowan--
you shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in l.a., for about twenty years.  look at my lp's. under 'autobahn.'
i certainly have!  very clearly!  because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
what are you talking about? vegas?
i guess i have. you were pretty little when they locked him up. i don't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months.
who sent you, thorpey?
it's forever you know.
yeah, i got the key, so i come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
come on inna dining room.
so what's that mean?  that you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
it's a risk i'm willing to take.
hey, you promised......don't worry, i'm wearing my girdle.
hit by a swinging door? or maybe a yellow cab?
you re not thinking of going to...
yesss, you are.  he's artistic.
i'm not nick!
but your father--he runs stuff, he--
. yeah!
oh man, bucky.
fine. i'll see you at the reception.
right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
you know how he is.  he goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  it blows over.
my ex-husband was a lawyer.
yes, my lord.
not today!
don't worry, mr. twombley, i know where those suckers are. rain or shine, snow or no snow. i know deer. we'll kill us a buck today. guaranteed. before ten.
what?
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there. also i enjoy history.
everything has it's drawbacks.
oh, right, you told me that.  they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese, as i recall.  how about you, winston?
no, cathy. he sold mr. fawcett a different brand.  you don't think they're getting sick, do you, mitch?
blake investigating missing scientists for ctu.  dr. manhattan somehow involved . . . 
so many people - know me. i wish i did. i wish someone would tell be about me...
now there's a coincidence. my father used to gamble there.
well, thank you.  anyway -- time for bed.  or... sofa-bed.
that'd be swell.  you know, you're an awful lot different than i thought you'd be.
why didn't you mention it in your letters?
ha!  that's the best part. i can't!!
what exactly did you hear?
hey, just calm down, i'm giving the orders here-
i love two things. i love you, and i love the opera. if i can have the two things that i love together for one night, i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
you thought i meant...too tough to apologize, huh? you must have been a very lonely girl.
he also conducted for hitler, didn't he?
naturally, you must expect me to attack with capo ferro.
listen to me, pendergast.  mbwun's dna is part homo sapien.  in primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  if you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  shoot it in the eye!
exactly.  you understand that, don't you?  you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
well, i ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
no. it's gotta be more than that. that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. too powerful.
this is not a joke.  they know that we know about them.  they're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
it's all for you. i'm not hungry. please go ahead.
if you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
no, no, listen. i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman.
well, if i have to, i have to.
taking pictures?  it's a long story. i'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
i'll have to perform one of my...operations!
no. come on.
what the devil do you want? listen, bruce, you can't come in here now! we're busy!  where you been, duffy? stick around! what? what chinese earthquake? the deuce with it... what's that?
will you be in atlanta for a while? i'm not buggin' you about coming home, i just wondered.
dr. jones?
i know, i know, and your hamster.
you're not going, are you?
you're not going to abuse them. they're all so sweet.
my car! my car! tan ciera!
pleased to meet you, sir.
i understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the police tonight.
no problem.  in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
no. every product contains one component. the elements react in combination. hair spray won't do it. but hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  untraceable. it's very elegant.
foxy. . . foxy. . . you know you're a cute little heartbreaker... foxy... you know you're a sweet little love maker...
pull your hammer back, smokey's coming at you.
yeah. sort of. daddy rounds 'em up. you aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
lower your voice!
yo, carlos-i'm gonna punch you.
that's our plan.
job.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
that's a feather in your cap, man. the paper of record.
charming.
yeah. hey thanks. that's real nice, travis.

huh?
mrs. kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
and the vodka.
position, bird of prey?
all right. okay. i'11 ... see you.
who?
you're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, jimmy.
60% of the women in this world are named "liz".
i can't help how i think. you're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
yes.  i can even read star maps.
because they're vampire wanna-bes. if they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
yes, sir...
the next batter, clendenon, hits one outta the park.
buttons are hochmut.
he's got a reputation for doing all his --
the four of you must have so much to say to each other - with mr. sampson leaving...
no, thank you.
here, practice on your arm like this.
and we're going away for a holiday.
go ahead -- what?
do you even know your daughter? there is no way she likes that song. or is she in a coma?
what do you mean, "you"?
edward.  my name is edward.
vincent.  it was nice to meet you. visit again?
couer de noir!  a demon if the devil ever made one.
take it easy.  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
he was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called springwood about eight miles from here.  guess what his murder weapon was? a glove with six-inch blades.
is she ever. i've got some stories....
we can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
and what? these things are octopusses?
not in the trunk.
sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. since that time i have found myself and my place. i know who i am. and i cannot go with you.
that would be thibadeaux. the cop i work for every now and then. catching thieves. the really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
that's right, hot shot! my turn. what's the matter with me, huh? why can't i ever get the great girl? give the big pig with the b.o. to healy, right? well i was sick of it, man! no more -- it was my turn. it was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
no...i need to sleep.
well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. how you gonna talk to civilians man? people back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what i mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
in a way.
there's nothing that great about discovery.  what's so great about discovery?  it's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  what you call discovery i call the rape of the natural world!
what's she talking about?
there ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
i just drove in this morning.
i will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "i am the law and i am the danish..."
for awhile we had this dream we were innocent. that was our bond... but then we woke up. and now i'd like to hear everything.
some hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
get lost bobby.
don't worry, lamar.
how can you think of food at a time like this?
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
yeah.
i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen.
i'm afraid we have another problem, mr. president.
come on, that's just a bullshit story. you said so yourself...
it couldn't have gone better. it's practically set.  of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
good, ted. piggy back ride?
how d'you do, good lady ... i am arthur, king of the britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
brace yourself.  we've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
i think that she thinks i may have molested her.
look, i didn't shoot him!
you know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
-- this is my lucky day.  i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
not a very good one, but--
it's all i could afford.
star wars?
you're not gonna see him again.
'bout time, pop.
yes, sir. i'll brace myself.
yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. it wasn't very scientific but it worked. when he won, he collected. when he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. what were they gonna do? muscle nicky?  nicky was the muscle.
dr. j.!
i like "godsend."
bring young masbath here.
go, sulu.
i have a gun.  it's under my bed.
you should have seen it erect.
no. it's not like that. you're being completely neurotic. i was just playing along...
perhaps, master galen, you may say.
yes. i bought the house from her, two years ago.
sure, mack...
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
see, it couldn't have been me. i was in jail, remember?
y-u-h-e-e-y-a-h.  yu-hee-yah...? no way, busters use it in a sentence.
the first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
get knotted.
what are we looking for?
can i see what you have so far?
i don't want to hear any more about it. if you don't get married, i'll fire both of you.
well that's not going to happen tonight. george said carlton's a nice guy.
dad, did you do it?  did you take that money?
what do you want?
i detest comparisons made with oil.
fired me!  i'm not a hysterical man.  i'm responsible.  i know what i saw....
i prefer waiting for a while...  i feel it would go the wrong way.
perhaps i'd better get you straightened out, mr. mitchell. you've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. and i'm grateful. but i don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
how do you know you're not german if you don't remember anything?
i hear nothing.
a tag on your toe. nobody threatens me and lives.
please don't leave.  i'm going to talk to you.  what's your name?
oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, i want to talk about you...
what?
i love you, nick...
they set a trap  they actually set a trap.
no, we'd never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
have they said anything about our area?
i ain't drunk, honey.
me?
most things.  we're very high on purpose.
it doesn't matter where you sit!
oh, i'm very grateful.
kelly wouldn't do that.
oh yeah. there's just one thing i don't get. "monkeybone creator awakens from coma" that's a big story! that's front page news! but i can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> hey. don't i have a tv show?
i know this has been painful, spock. for me too. thank you.
come on. haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
what do you want? damn it, why isn't there a girl here? you know this has nothing to do with age. this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies.
what? what?!
that's good. very good. now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
but it's a great story. somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
how different?
you still got that map?
can you fix it?
so why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
if they knew what they were carrying.
what are you, a dance judge?  go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
i love you, elaine.
or your fucking wife, jerry.
hey!
now, nuke, would i do a thing like that?  hey kids, this is the great ebby calvin "nuke" laloosh.
they were looking for wood.
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers.  good for four months.

he wasn't superhuman dewey. he wasn't superhuman at all.
agent chase, does it appear that they are heading for mexico.

if corbett's men find out --
i assume his girlfriend.
24-hour tail on taransky?
sylvan can be talked into anything.
find him!  i want to talk to him.
figured it was something like that.
sorta brown, blonde, i guess. but dig this, sweetie. then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
i knew how planes flew, but i was still a little nervous.
i've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
to seek the grail!
what's your story, baby?
oh, yeah. no. i mean yeah, i stopped by for a drink. didn't see you.
i made miss - miss alexander send you the note.  she was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
i don't understand you.
but wynant --- ?
they used copper pipes in their plumbing... so i melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  it's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
shaddup!  jade, what can i fix you?
this is metropolis after hours! this is what you'll be writing about. c'mon, let's dance.
oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. you know how much he hated west --
a bomb.  at the viaduct. she closes the door, then reappears.
it's about time. isn't fun great?
well, you were working there--
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being, i would make peace with all.  i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. and rage the likes of which you would not believe. if i cannot satisfy the one, i will demonically indulge the other. that choice is yours.  you're the one who set this in motion, frankenstein.
...holding action.  they're going to tear this guy to <u>shreds</u>.
okay.
but there wasn't any...
don't like her?   what's wrong with her?  she's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
hold off for now. just stay close to her.
well, i hope so.
good. now, if you'll pardon me, i have to go to work.
he's writing his name in water.

uh,  i don't know. i gotta tell you, i don't know.
pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
mr. treves, tell me... tell me truly. is it alright, did i make any mistakes that you can see?
is she a friend of yours?
i can't do this.
this is it, kid. this is our chance. when you got a chance, you better take it.
see what?
we did.  bad mistake.  the fans are clamoring for more. so, evil never dies, right?  anyway, a while back we got a call from wes.  he's got this idea.  and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator?
but you said --
but this is *my land*, son. don't you understand?
enough!
perhaps -- but if i must face it, let it find me, for i shall search for it no more.
did you need it?
yah?
it's in your interest, nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an lapd officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  tell the man.
i'm not going!
what's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
yeah.
yes sir. it will be the best of your collection, i assure you.
all right, all right. keep quiet.
cheer up buddy buddy. you shook gekko the great's hand and you still got all your fingers. he's not the only elephant in the jungle.
a man eater! fantastic!  making history, herb
raw.
that's because it was a challenge. you has control over you're situation. it was hard, but you rose to it.

well, it's still a good idea.
sure, what is it?
so we understand each other?
maybe he got promoted.
i can't do this.
it is tomorrow. four a.m. how come you're so late?
go ahead.
stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  the press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
and senator paine too, ma--we'd like to have him--
i'll take a chance.
know what?
it was only an accident that we discovered them.
i love the fragrance of chilidogs.
we will be happy to beam down. but first we must have certain assurances.
"there is no second place." plus every time i get jammed-up, gary has an inspiration.  is it like that with your counselor?
what about my neck?
you doing a story on this guy?
no... but what choice have we?
how did you get here?
yes. things fall into place.
if we move in a group, we are one target. if we scatter, they can't get us all.
you're just scared.  i know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  i believe in you.  you just have to get back on the court.  like you'd get back on a horse.
you looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
come on. it's you favorite scary movie, remember? he had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
yeah, really.  you do.  you do.
good coloring.

i'm the one you want!  penguin, please!  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max, not chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
calm down, tracy.  just calm down.
tripp, where the hell...
he's yours but i take him in!  i'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but i'm walkin' him in.
not like this.  are you even listening?
h-how do i get...?
i'll go.
you've had a pretty tough break at that. twice a missus and still unkissed.
yes.
what you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
maybe i thought i could do more good here than there.  i don't know.  look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  but, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
three's a crowd. yes, i'm aware of that. but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes. to make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
why? what's wrong?
let's not start on that again, jeff -- please. i'm just beginning to get over it.
our cards, please.
oh. oh god. i don't care about anything. i don't care about anything! take me to the bed.

she didn't write to me, did she.
but dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
i don't believe i'm hearing this.  a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  they were acting.  they were all acting, from the beginning.  and we bought it, hook, line and sinker... and now they're home free with six million of sandra van ryan's money.

oh, you mean of bonnie and clyde?  hm. you ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  you could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
no.
i think you'd look good in red.
but he'll kill her!
i don't have the experience.  father thomas should officiate.
did you see her undressed?
keith's hot.
i know, i know. perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
daddy!
one phone call every day. just tell us what you've seen. don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
i'll tell you, then. the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself. listen to it.  they listen. did they pick little k's recording? did they pick some other conductor? no, they picked you, and why? because you represented them so beautifully. when the devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. you were everything to them.
oh really?
but we went there.  we saw those kids.
[beat] i don't know.
considering your financial circumstances, mr. cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. but, obviously, if you would reject this offer, i shall keep trying to find a better one.
oh, it'll be fine, i'm sure, claudia.
i heard you playing.
there's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  that's what ransom is.  those are the fucking rules.

uh, my watch stopped.
a friend.  i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
well, it is to me.  will you give her a message?  i'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
i believe so.
how are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
whatever i can do to help.
good.
something important?  a thing that cannot wait?
i'm sorry.
i was giving you a chance. no matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck. he could track a falcon on a cloudy day. he can find you
i'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
we're going to think about it, cole. among ourselves.  we'll get back to you.

oh, sorry.
what department store did they go to?
you'd think she was marrying him. what are you watching?
you came here to look at me, will. to get the old scent again, didn't you?

out the back.
what about tonight then, are you going to that party at valhere's?
don't feel bad, mr. luthor. it almost worked. i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean. millions of people almost killed. if it hadn't been for that guy superman - that overgrown boyscout...

thank you.
why not?
i understand, george.
i get that feeling.  you know, mr. tyler, i'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. but after spying you across the room, i'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
it's easy. i've done it.
whenever you lose, you get this attitude. but it's just a game.
what was it?
ticklish?
that's a doozy of a dream, son.
i know you will.

i'm giving her an assignment.  i am offerring you a choice.  if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  if not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  your like will be destroyed.

let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, mummy!

it's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
don't be ridiculous.  i'm a reporter.
my son! do you really think, ma....
your department contacted our agency regarding information on sarah williams.
amazing.
it's a mess, right now.  that's my project when i get back.
sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
hold on, baby, he'll get you.
i'm looking for...i guess you could say i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
the horseman.  yes.
you're a sick puppy, geller.
you ever think about killing another human being?
what the fuck is going on?

no it's not okay. you have to have this in by tomorrow. did you see the ad we ran sunday?
how could i? i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
i'll be damned...
you want me to sit here and be passive. the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you'll let us go. i'm not there yet. you have to convince me you're telling the truth.
but you're not...you're not still here.
right back where we started.
was it worth it?
ok...that's it.
some champagne, miss flaemm?
you like her.
i don't think so...
these adults are tough enough, i think you'll be surprised -- the mexican's a bit of a question mark --
i do know, gary. i feel the same way. i thought i was coming here for a job. but it's meant a lot more.
that's right.
nope.
but something is going on at the yu household.
in the bag underneath.

so, what is it you do, mister...?
how's the left these days?
nice place.
you're a good man.
the process is known as "impact boosting..." while not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. there's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
sure.  i was just doin' my nails.
what was your relationship with her?
-- and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
i rest.
so, it's obvious, huh?
okay.  i went to sell blood yesterday.  that's how it is.  i'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and i'm selling my blood.
nobody lives forever, boy. who'd want to?
you're not listening to me --
when a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window. it was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
okay, give me the keys.

jason..
i don't want to rush you. take a couple of seconds.

operations building.  far end of the street.
yes.
no, i want to go in.
we were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  it was either this or an orgy.  vera chose this.  what're ya gonna do?
jerry?  please.  stop this.
she sits down.
i'm sure he believed every word.
that's what he keeps telling me.
he was delightful.
how's your own boy, miz cooper?
it's not right.
what about that d.b. cooper guy?
all right, let's forget about them for the time being. what about your weed man?
brody?  this is patrol base.
if you don't get out of here, i'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
it's where he hides out.  inside.  that's how he found me.
now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. i just carry that. you been listenin' to them cops too much.
it always is.
not much.
to save us work on the spring plowing?
this is great.  and it's yours?  you like own it?
if i die, then they'll be free. it's getting late, isn't it? i can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. it's warm then it gets cold. jeffrey. i feel it getting cold.
there's some folks i want to keep tabs on. dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. your kind of people.
i know who you are and what you want.
oh michael.
who is he?
ya think?
animals kill only from hunger or fear. the man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
passion.
you said trask was arranging laboratory work. police laboratory. anything from that?
fuck off man.  it's just a fish.
nope. never been.
oh, am i learning it faster than you did? maybe i'm smarter.

now now, ann! try be to polite.
i have dissolved the senate.
why do you watch?
and caesar!  let's not forget to serve caesar!
i feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. we don't have to fight with steel. i can fight with words.  i'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  call him up in east st. louis, penelope.  tell him to come here.
nothing.
what's happening?
house.
and are you sure you want to marry me? are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
i won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if i want to do it.
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out, didn't she?

all the best people.
oh, come on.

i ain't pissing nothing away--i got a porsche already.  a 944 with a.c. and a quadraphonic blaupunkt.
i do.
he truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
no promises, mr. scott. on your way.
not really.  look, annie, i love you.  let's leave that out of it.  i don't want to be someone you're settling for.  i don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  i have a life insurance policy, i'm fully invested in growth stocks, i have a paid subscription to home rox office, i have no sexual diseases, i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, i dress nicely, i am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, i don't watch monday night football, the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  if you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
my husband is with me, too.
anything this time?
how about -- ?
yeah, like maybe never.
what did you call me?
phone for help?  we're right in the middle of nowhere. there isn't a town within ten miles of here.
not a one.
you'll visit again?
so?
that's from skiing.
just go.  it's all right.  wyatt, really.  work well.
sorry, sugar. go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed.
not much. we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
nobody. it was closed.
mi jesus…mi jesus…
i do bite my thumb, sir!
you shouldn't go alone.  he might claim that you tried to black mail him.
bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when i left the office. it might spin up to 25 by the bell...
me? i have lived by the oath of king and knight.
don't speed, chase.  it's not...
the fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
it doesn't make sense to me.
the black capsule. finest kind. thank you, dr. mcintyre.
... a cloaking device?
like what?
i'm curious, but i don't want to know. jeez, i hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
you can't do that.
the mattress... the mattress... julia.
pretty much.
same as last time -- the rest after.
how's the fungus around your thumbnail?
nothing.
the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta. what a gusher. had a cup on his belt, so i used it to catch a little run-off. metallic taste to it, human blood. coppery. but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. course, that's more for winter. summertime, i take mine straight.
i'm not convinced you should be happy.
all of, they got you on this "board..."
why, i couldn't do that . . . !
what else do you believe in?
alright, i said i was sorry.  can we start over again? i think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
and i'm the closest thing to it, right?
when was the last time you heard me sneeze?
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson?
whose?
"but new struck nine."
that's no way to talk...
oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
was i alright, sir? did i do well, sir?
you know what the word glimpse means, j? it’s by nature an impermanent thing.
excellent. dc mitchell is a rising star, mr. stevens. under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
yeah, explode it up your ass!
tank, it's me.
but i don't understand --
it couldn't!
i'll take that.
you wanna know why?  'cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents 'til kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause kennedy promised 'em too damned much. revolution comin'.  fascism's coming back.  i tell ya this - the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  i jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  people should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'cause he was a communist.  put me on the stand, go ahead, i'll tell the same goddamn story, i'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
that woman's laugh creeps me out. i heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... sound'd like the wicked witch...
mommy, where are you?
i'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
my ass!
y-yeah.
"out of weariness, i spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. and i gave my heart to know madness and folly."

you'll see.
the name's walter.
you know rock-n-roll?  darlin', i've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  i've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then i guess i'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
i'm going with you.
you're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
tim.
sure.
he was still warm when they confirmed.
father, tell me what happened at fort wilderness?
how long have they been married?
oh no. i'm not tired at all.
this guy was a bad monkey.  he dabbled in all the black arts, and listen to this prophecy.  just before his head died, his last words were, "death is but a door, time is but a window.  i'll be back."
paul. are you alright?
so, how are you doing in marlboro country? is the magazine complaining at all?
but i'd give a great deal to know.
no, no. i wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
[where are you staying in mexico?]
elijah who?
won't daddy powell take care of us?
second generation, huh?
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
you're right.  i better use two.
he didn't say that.
i don't need to pass basic seamanship.

this is stupid.
nothing so far.

i think so.
didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
it's my mother.  who needs this shit?
one of our only leads... you had dates with both men right before they were killed.

if i was, then i would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't i?
i do love you.  let's get lost together.
you don't have any money left, okay?! that's the truth. i don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. you spent it all. you can't buy the tribune in chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. now you better face up to it--

you know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
what do you mean, "all of us?"
sorry.  you don't know how many times i've heard that.  "a lady lawyer?  are you crazy?"  like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  or better, in fact.

yes.
your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
tawny? what's- what are you doing?

maybe he doesn't see it that way. maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  that's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
yeah, i remember you.
you were pretty popular. didn't you run for some office?
no -- don't worry about it.  let's do this.

i'll have it in a minute.
he's one of the best chess players in the world.  who better to play a game with?

get out of the room! you've got company coming up. i'll meet you at the chevy.
no.
what is it?
we've got nothing to say.

ok, ok. you guys just go back in. dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. go on.
some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. interesting, huh?
i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i'm starting the blonde legal defense fund.
gimme some chili, fries, and a tab.
why, what did he do?
yeah, that's out of context. okay.
how can you be fair with animals? they recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own grandmother's neighborhoods.  and everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  let me run my family without you on my back.  i want them taken care of.
he said that, too.
unless he makes a move during seventh period.

daitz hinted it existed. it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
yeah.
emergency procedures.
the warehouse.  buxton seeds.  it's tomorrow.
stop, or i'll burst out crying.
i don't know.
amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
what are those things?
yeah, you're probably right.
would you do me a favor?
'cause of ebby calvin laloosh.  the big club's got a hundred grand in him-
do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
all right, damn you! all right!  give me a minute to inform my crew.
three legs.
the mafia!  la cosa nostra!
from your office, sir.
look out!
gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
can't they make exceptions?  maryanne heinel?  she's such a scud.  can't we have a maryanne clause?
this is the baby. your baby.
can you use these?
keep trying!
and may i ask what could possibly be more important than fawell oil v. u.s. environmental agency?
dmitri hired him!  he's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  he was stalking you when i dropped you off.  i don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
i'm sorry i treated you mean today. you shouldn't believe what i say when i'm with the kids.  nobody acts sincere.
it's what you want?
asks my name.  over and over.  just like a broken record.  only thing is, i can't answer.  i've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
there we go.
do i know hans hinkel?
not this week.
you went from high school to the agency?
and you b-believe that.
always.
now penny, stop that!
i want you... to bend over.
we have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and i chose my mother. she was born in los angeles and since my uncle phil moved out here i came in to visit him and then i looked at her high school yearbook and...  and i called a few people and one guy said that she went to ucla, another guy said that i should call hillary mitchell so....
no, i'm sorry, for pushing you out.
i'm afraid so.
"death at the double x ranch" - ra- a-nch.
yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
lissen, i heard that before--
right, then...
a man after my own heart...
wonderful. what's she like, brother? what is your impression of her?
david, i don't... can we talk privately for a second?
you're drunk.
gold leaf, art nouveau, french, early nineteen hundreds... i could probably fence this for three or four grand.
one week old.
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
late night.  you?
i only enjoy acting for myself. i hate it when other people are let in.
uh...sure...when?
shit, dude, i didn't know.  i wouldn't've done it if i knew he was a fucking crybaby.
oh -- but it can't be.
sure, i understand.  look, i don't want to take up any more of your time.  you get back, and i'll wait here for a bus.
yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  four o'clock could be good.
well, excuse me for livin'!
it's never over...  here comes another six years of bad dreams.
is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
well...
so?
do we have a deal?
ah. well. congratulations. meanwhile, what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
ya learned good. so, what's happening?
go?! wait a minute - that's a great story! newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from schuyler mansion, and—
what did it say?
we get fifty percent. and we get clear of the king.
mrs. mercer, as a former fbi man, it's difficult to accept this.
how many different girls? didn't we already have this discussion once?
it's happening right now.
sure! mckinney will never suspect you--
no, i live about in wexford.  it's about a five hour drive.
hea<u>ther</u>, i've got something going with j.d.
if i tell you i didn't, david, that's what i mean.
wallace's followers.
well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
you have no pants, sir.
probably.
well, i've got quite a lot on my mind.
why not?
look, bodhi man.  people are dead. the ride is over.
i didn't mean to say anything bad about you. i know you're good. you didn't mean no harm.  did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
well, then... i hope we don't run into any tonight.
"hell up here?"  honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! hell everywhere.
yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. this by an unknown subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
okay.
neither your stomach or your opinion matters here dorsett... what matters is that mr. trafficante and the bureau have come up with a solution to our panther problem. one might say...the final solution.
it's just carpet.
oooh, baby, you were the best. i was beside myself.
bryant here.  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, esper's concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  you better get on it.
i thought all for the best.
i hear we must pay for everything. how much for this?
as opposed to twenty angry women?
...then what about...
well, there it is. now to business. young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. what do you say?
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but i grew up in hell. my grandmother had more attitude. you don't intimidate me.
thank you. goodbye, john.
this is my business. mr. dickson's been like a father to me.  what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
i think you do.
337.....i'm sorry....
go where? to the kommandant's office and tell him where dunbar is?
give me a break.
all right. send him in.
i remember, sid! mr. kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
i hope i'm not interrupting.
i'll try to remember that . . .
fishing.  look, jimmy... i need you to help me.  this is serious.  i'm in trouble and i need you to help me.  can you do that?
but you are aware, he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager.
you want this in black chips.
oh yesil...  yesil's his name but i...don't know anything... 'bout...yesil...
oooh, ba-by!
i'm not sure.
i don't think that's such a safe idea
so let's talk.
try less appropriate.
yeah, well, perhaps...  speaking of which:  i have a <u>prescription</u> here, i'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, i need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
... i bet you're gay.
eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
please, mr crane, it's ok, please--
this little table is one heavy bitch.
the what?
two hundred meters.
what'd you say?
i'm not sure i'd be good company tonight.
well, not really. at first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
fuck you.
the president's in europe. tomorrow he'll be in turkey. right along this fault line.  they launched the space shuttle yesterday.
just look.  what do you wear? a nine?
no way, ma'am !
besides i can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. that should shore up that prick hank drexler.
yeah.
that's not the country luke fought for.
what do you mean?
you may use my office.
you've betrayed the federation - all of you.
not in the fitting room.
shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
landon --
mrs. mulwray, i'm afraid that's not good enough.
ain't been too good...no sir, not too good...gettin' old, ethan...
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll?
we can't just go off and--
no.
insurance policy.  now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  press play.
what do you mean?
stand back -- i'm about to do my happy dance.
what?
what do you mean?
quiet!
- because it's good!
no, i mean doing it at my house.
an' masseria's got seven hundred.
i'll go into town with you.
not bad. but come on, harry; what's the real reason?
oh, god, was this like an rsvp thing?
they had us bugged.  christ, he had everybody bugged.  yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  that was hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
...who'd ya fight?
you must have quite some harem.
henry chapman's daughter. it was sheila. i remember her from last year.
look at that right eye.
none of which i am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
tell her to go back to resurrection.
well, i guess he don't care that it's obvious.
yes, sir !
but, father, i don't really want any of that.
no, it's more like a leave of-  ha, ha, ha. yeah, they fired me.
how much would you charge me for the lips?
don't hurt him.
yeah, so i've been thinking.  i love her, y'know?  i kind of want to have her.  i've been away for so long.  make up for the missed time, you know?
didn't you know this is my home town?
you will not say one single word. i know your secret.
yeah.
you do?
oh, hey man, how are ya?  i wondered if i'd see you again.
come again?
looking for peanuts, i suppose.
the number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  and it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
i'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
look at these people behind you. i'm totally convinced they're satanists.
don't!
it's a sign i've watched this movie too many times.  i'm so stupid.  from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio, i've been a complete jerk.
anne vicksey didn't own a dog.
looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? the only time they ever picked me up, mckinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
whenever you ask me something why do you always say "let me ask you something?" why don't you just ask me?
i want to ask you something.
well i don't.
what’s your business with elektra king?
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle. they don't like the way you operate. they helped her.
your parents met her.
you're at paul owen s.
shut up.
maybe this wasn't just a trick. maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
what?
i'm down.
w-w-what has that got to do with this maiden?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
you know what sanford told me? 
do what? i haven't done a thing.
surf's up.
i could get the death penalty.
gabriel, let him go --
i went looking for you. i went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened? you didn't tell me how to do that, did you? i knew i was under surveillance, so when i couldn't spot anybody, i started yelling.
shit, beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? it's only halloween.
jesus christ. you're hammered. what are you doing?
could you do me a favour?
i have to go home and get my things.
it’s not about him. it's eric. he's alone out here somewhere. our baby is all alone.
try to think what it was.
i'd like a dry martini. very dry, please.
okay, stand by in operations.  let's go.
what are they?
this is different.  this is better. think of when you're working out, oz. you need a partner, someone to spot you.  someone to keep you motivated.
okay, son.
i'm wrong here.  i wasn't meant to see this...
no thanks.
read it.
be quiet, chick--i'm trying to think--  this deficiency bill is going to be read in the senate tomorrow.
six. i go red next year.
the kind where there isn't really an answer.
don't make me do it, man
that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
what the hell would i do with that grease pit? besides, nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. then all this abilene shit happened. you heard about that bank robbery in abilene, didn't ya?
i know...
i need to tell you something, and i'm not sure how.
maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
thank you.
i love the symphony.
well that's stupid. this is my park just as much as it is theirs. you think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
sure. why not.
of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
no...
no. keep all energy to the armor.
please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? we don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
i'm so sorry peter. gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i followed you here from court.
commandeer.  we're going to commandeer a ship.  nautical term.
where the fuck is foley?
he wants me to break a leg?
she thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
exactly.  gregor, he was the russian's man.  it was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the russians who had the capital to finance it.  gregor, he was their insurance, and i was ours. everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  gregor must've got to swede...
somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
you'd do this to me!
they live in malaysia. in this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
golly, i'd probably faint.
yessir, his vehicle. man killed lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
that's what i'd planned to...
should we buy a frame for that?
leave me alone -- !
i always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
david... sorry i'm late.
if he files are you going to take the case?
work, work, work, that's all do
i'm here to see iris.
maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
i dreamed about always being warm... stay a while....
amy, it's me.  listen very carefully..
i shit you not. mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. we'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. you know -  "what are you doing, man? i'm not a fag. i'll kick your ass if you say anything."  it's like, for christsakes greg, you're gay, deal with it. the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a hoover.
i left in a bit of a hurry.  i'm terribly grateful, sean.
did you tell joe to behave?
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?
well, yes, she's happy. of course dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. there isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
what do you want?
what do you want me to *do*?
i'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. you said you knew about ilsa and me.
i am. ben meeker.
you mean, am i gonna help you kill them cowboys?
deanna, stand by.  open a channel.
helen, i'm going to philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. make all the arrangements, will you?
we'll make it.
a revolutionary approach to the theater. however, if i may a suggestion...
i'm your doctor and i'm your friend, jim. get back your command. get it back before you really do grow old. before you turn into part of this collection.
remember those words.
answer when the governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
by the way, mr. mcgann just phoned-- in a high fever. smith's gone again. have you any idea where?
how's granma since we got her in the tent?
words.
could you?
fuck off, dave.
gimme the keys.
mr. chairman -
i've got to play it rough with them. if they know anything, i'm gonna know it.
look. those kids are still trick-or- treating. they're still out.
anything.
otto, we are mere mortals. you must never forget your own limits--
you bet.
yeah... let me think about it.
you are so full of shit...
this is a complicated case, your honor...
sure, heaven! you've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
oh. did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
oh, no, sir!
allison dormere. your intern.
yes!
yeah?
oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  if you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
let me get a shot of it.
sorry.  we had another bat sighting.
you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. you have always been a fringe player. you have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
why—
something wrong with that?
mrs.  otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  the word doesn't mean anything to me.  as far as i'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  that's what's done, mrs. otto.  i've seen it happen so many times before.
obvious?  why don't you and i have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
oh-huh.
you've come to lecture me?
so you'll relieve me at 2:30...
we've got the tape to prove it.
right around here, in the food court.
so. what should i do now?
seems like we have another one every week.
that's marriage.
no. i'm good.
what i <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  applications and patents, reed. this all belongs to me.
liz, hold on a second --  what?
nobody.
wait!
well... yes... i had a trailer. it's not like i made him run along side of the car.
i'm ready for a complicated man.
no, no ... come on in.
excuse me...!
that you were just indulging me.
only if you can prove to me that you're really brian cruikshank.
what's your eta?
you don't have a shred of evidence!
what do we do?
so do you, fast eddie.
you cannot escape your destiny.
shh!
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
you weren't straight with us, frankie, what else could we do?
it's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. imbecile.
vada i wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
where?
no, not words.
that's too bad. get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. some kid i wouldn't let wash my mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. damn, i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger. he's fat, that's why, falls faster. i'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. am i shot, frank?
i'd like to... take you out or something.
not yet, the wife in working on our first.  you got any kids back on the ranch?
i don't follow.
not true.
ain't it just? the man who invented beer, louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
what about you, captain?
three...two...one...
to not do that.  to not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
yeah... so, listen-you drive?
you want to go live?
yes, but i'm the only one who knows him. i  --  i really like the guy. and he likes me.  i think. i mean, i could talk to him, you know? and he could talk to me.  anytime...
i can't stand a voyeur. i'll be back.
you think so!?  i've been working out a lot since the baby. and i've been working.  and that takes it's toll, you know.
certainly.
no what?
fine, honey.  stay asleep.
... yes.
i woke to the sound of zoe's breathing.  it was laboured.  i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  i grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
incidentally, what happened to that doll? - you gave me the item last night.  still alive?
we'll need our birth certificates. i happen to have mine with me. where's yours?
whatever makes you happy.
basically.
can i speak to you in confidence?
milos.  get my money!
home! meet me at the office. we've got to do something ... you've got to do something adam!
i thought -— is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. no. not my favorite client. she's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
andersonville.  they did horrible things to men there...
that's alright. i was having a bad dream. i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
my daughter lives right across the street from the satan's disciples' clubhouse, and i was so worried about her ... so, i went over and introduced myself. and they were the nicest people.
yes... i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo. there were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
i was just thinking out loud...  i mean, you've got this whole thing with dana -- i'm not going to let you fuck that up...
do you have your masters?
aw, mom! i hate mr. stubbins!
not yet.
he sold me this bad boy.
i doubt it. [beat] i don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
i got to go.  i'm late.
to you, to me it's thursday.
really, i don't know enough about it to...
i doubt that's the end.
sure you could, in wildwood, new jersey. if you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth. but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
help yourself prickfuck!
boy? you here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
c'mon, mommy, don't start with that i'm an ungrateful son stuff.
where've you been?
how the hell are you going to do that?
that's correct.
hey. what are you doing? how are you?
whatever you need.
... hello.
plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
what?
it's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
it's too dangerous....
very well, mr. chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. if indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
what's he talkin' about?
stop staring. do a vase.
helluva time for vanity!
no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
this time i'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
give me that phone.  yes, sir, this is the manager. what seems to be the problem?
don't think i won't.
for the moment.  we're in the main hangar.  artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
maybe you should see a shrink.
i can't go back to sleep again.
well, roy, if that's the way you feel, i won't badger you.  don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
no. that's the last thing i'll do. you never asked what happened.
part of the reason i'm here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within brown & williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
ah, dammit!
yes, ben - he is.
yah -- gladys had me order that swan special made from mexico  in case becky won. i do a lotta business with those people. i always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  whoo, they love that.
oh, please...
you're a great man, mr. roth, i have much to learn from you.
why are you doing this to me? i'll give you whatever...
his name is frank.
that's my good boy.
mister finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
that's not where i am.  miller no? where are you?
no. and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal's done. we've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
chancellor gorkon, can you hear me? chancellor...?
goddammit!  that's outrageous.
i can't.
they can lead us to jimmy. just let them go. we're tightening the net on him. we know he's on the reservation.
do you have any idea who she is?
was you that high? old man, i threw the slats at you. i said to combinate me.
i feel like shit...
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals. looking for me.
i don't know.  i prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
yeah, casey and steve were completely hollowed out. takes a man to do something like that.
thanks.
by the way, i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists. gift tokens. medical gift tokens.
what are you talking about?
now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
yes?
really.  i don't know.
yeah, we'll see.
hell, if i did, i wouldn't have any friends.
john, he's got my driver's license.
undoubtedly, i know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
he's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
oh my, no!
so be it. it looks serious this time, though. all these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
why did you do that, brother? i've never done wrong to you.
as long as i get the laugh.
well, it's over between you and him. we're getting married next month.
sure.
what's a "little while?"
but thank you for speaking to me as a godfather.
i don't know.
you're going to pay for this...
yeah, i know you do...  you know, i came up through sales. one of the reasons i was a great salesman, was i never made a promise i couldn't keep.  i knew that if i ever broke my promise i'd suffer the consequence...
habit.
oh, calvin, i'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
you're missing most of your life, jim, and you don't even know it. the kids are missing out too.  it's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
there was a buddy bragg at lompoc around the same time foley was there.  we got an address for him at the adams hotel in hallandale.  i want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  if he does, you call me right away...
--vanished.
three sixes. is that any good?
i see.
it's your dirty roll, cheswick.
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met--
of course not. it's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
"consumer recrreation services." what, do they make golf clubs?
sidney.
right, for us. but...i’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
i'm here, aren't i?
all right, get outa here.  you're outta work.
we'll take care of schulz.  come on.
yes, sir.  why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
same thing happened to me with wife two.  i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty.  i mean empty.  she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  what kind of person would think of that?
you don't have to explain. you have every right to come.
you took her because she helped me.
there's nothing to forgive. it was all a dream.
his name was meng si zhao.  he was a brother to li mu bai by oath. one day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of li mu bai's enemy.  after, li mu bai and i went through a lot together.  our feelings for each other grew stronger.  but how could we dishonor meng's memory?  so the freedom you talk about, i too desire it.  but i have never tasted it.
look at me! my dress is ruined. i look like shit.
let's lift up her shirt.
yes.  i see your point.
even when you were young?
yes. that is correct.
in a minute.
plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
for pooping, silly.
you fucking bastard!
any particular reason?
yes -- that's us.
very high an' very fast.
he's a good man.
leave me alone, can you?!
nothing.  i was just making sure. so, who are you?
didn’t you say i came recommended?  that’s what i thought. may i know by whom?
his lightsaber.
you bust outa jail, tom?
like hell you are.
pretty near. what do you know about the outfit we're going to?
rolls his eyes, takes a breath. scrambles into the gap.  the other five right behind.
people didn't complain?
finn ...
no plates. no registration. serial numbers removed. and all prints washed off by the river. that's great. this is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
you can't end up with tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
i see. i've suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?
look at her! she'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
i am not flexible on this.
she's a broad!  got it!  just some broad!
what?
sure!  excuse me.
i have my reasons.
i gotta go, flip.  thanks.
on what?
i can take care of myself.
i'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. okay?
damone! you come here?
what's it matter? get to the point.
it's their presidential suite.
it wasn't a trick!
fine, i'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! it's the only statement you need to make.
subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, osborne?
nothing. not even a stick of gum.
we've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna. and we want you to be our guide.
no. i'm not boyd. i am not cool at all.
no. kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
why'd you stay behind?!
i'm so sorry if you were offended!
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
i don't know! i can't see them from here, joel! just pick something good.
alice...
everybody knew him. he got around.
yes. i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications. it took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: adenine di-methyloxide. adm. i call it adam. but just before he was attacked, he hid it...
oh my god, by wolves?
i won't say anything.
...office 2702.
i am afraid.
no, sir.
i'm not playing around. i forgot.
i told you i had a lot of relatives.
well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
yeah, he wants us to talk to buddy, set up a meeting.
i think you should establish a good line of credit.
go ahead! go back!
well, i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person.
what about the dog?
it was beautiful. and getting better all the time.
what's that, chief?  say again.
do they have a show to give it to you?
couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
there's no sin in charity, jeanne.
birds are not aggressive creatures, miss. they bring beauty to the world. it is mankind, rather, who...
and you can? power it up?
of what?
only the beginning...
rain.
is it a crime?
oh, come on, rachel. no way.
but you talk about passion, about longing, about things i'll never know in my life! it's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! and then you tell me it ends like that? just empty?
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
not this time! it was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. and do you know who he was, children?
bela died.
that's what you're buying. put it in your pocket.
no, sir.  it will never happen again.
ahhh!
you gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
if there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
and where they hide the real money.
big deal!
you wouldn't kiss him, huh?
people who know say the girl's got talent. you must judge for yourself. if you think she stinks, say so.
i have my own little island.
where to?
misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
how much for everything.
go head on, breaker.
some kids were teasing you?
come, now. you just got here.
...which is a long, dull story and i won't get into it.  but--
we were just looking.
i'm serious, dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
no. we can't can't go on this way. we can't go back to the old way either.
uh huh...  okay, we'll be there. how is he, anyway?
well, your a. buttle has been confused with t47/215, an a. tuttle. i mean, it's a joke! somebody should be shot for that. so b58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
i've retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you'll find helpful.
what's this, what's this?!
okay, i'll tell her.
what?
fail-safe?
power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. if i can hit him. i can kill him. but i gotta be close. very close.
we gonna hit 'em wid da bomb dickey on dis' one.  what's the setting?
it's okay. i didn't think you were.
uh, uh, i'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and i just wanted to meet you.
do it, norbert.
before bill came to hollywood.
please.  just tell me what’s happening to me. in plain english.  none of that mumbo jumbo...
five minutes and fifty seconds.
what?
very much so.  we are all, save my friend here.
my mind is made up.  she will not set foot in my house again.  i think if i saw her again, i might be tempted to strangle her.
too bad.
only octavius knows for sure.  and last time i spoke to him, he was on the planet whiz-bang.
i know a glenn.
gee, thanks boss.
i don't know. maybe in literature. that's his section.
oh man...
he wants playmates.  oh he's a sweetheart, sal, you know i love him. but he's not going to be a good father. he's just not parenting material.
fuck!
dead.
then light the match, paul.
sometimes you can't know what i'm doing.  it's better that way.
you coward!
take your average cop.  they deal with death everyday.  if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
goodbye.
he needs our help!
that's not the way we look at it.
wouldn't dream of it.
the town looks clear.
we've been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston.
all right. now finish your drink.
what was that?
i don't want your fucking money!
gotcha george, not a problem. tomorrow. hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
all right.
judy barton.
i sold all the wind instruments.  hawaiian air, business class. and you like that new fur coat?
my laboratory was about... here. and the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  mrs. watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
take off your top.
god. people exaggerate so much at this school.
i've been working double shifts.
can't you understand--i got tired of being a woman. i wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
pair'a nines.
why would someone do that?
can't get it. it won't... 
hey, sweetheart. what you up to?
only if you really, truly mean it.
yeah.
they'll be thinking of that, too.
you want a convertible or hardtop?
keep moving!
i'm just saying, the man is a problem.  and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.
just send me a money order.
is that ok?
yeah, mack?
keep away from me!  i don't believe you anymore!
wanna fool around?
sorry, eddie, i forgot you're not a toon.
well yeah.  pretty much.  i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc.  i mean sooner or later you gotta grow up.
you can stay here.
this guy's gonna kill him.
that's against the law, isn't it? i can't wear a uniform anymore.
i know you lost all his work. maybe i could come down here and --
i've been saying that since we met.
he won't be looking for you.  just be careful.  buy a book.  keep your sunglasses on.
i'll explain on the way.
that'snotmy name...find lily, gimmme that, give it --
i was insulted, so i asked her if i was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
i'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
without the glasses you're not even ugly.  i don't need them because i never read. how do i look.
wait a minute.  we're not going back there.
i don't want to remember!
would you?  because if you couldn't, i would be very lonely... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen.  but none of this will happen.  so it doesn't matter.  because we are on the guajira peninsula.  and all you see around you...look around... is archangel de jesus montoya- londono.  he is my man.  and you are a smuggler moving a load...
he sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i'll fucking kill you!
there is no relevant precedent.
there's a message for you at the office. your kid was hurt.
she did not do it... please listen...
shhhh... you hear that?
he's a great guy - leland.  why'd he ever leave new york?
i'm sorry miss weathers. allow me to introduce myself, mark kincaid, l.a.p.d.  are you familiar with the actor ben damon, or the actress christine perkins?
...what do you have to offer?
he can't hear you, rose. he's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
and it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  did it?
it's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
you got any money?
look, brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. don't forget, she contacted you. she's out here for her own reasons, god knows what they are.
he says --
no. no. be a doll and just get me a perrier, okay?
enough for a test.
you don't owe me no nothing.
her name is annie.  annie reed.
i love you, max. i really mean it. i love you. come to the pantry.
you're a good mother.
did you have a nice flight?  are they taking good care of you?
your excellency!
you want to fuck me. but you can't fuck me.
that's probably why hannibal lecter's so smart.
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast, martin. he might still possibly survive if attended to soon. and he did cooperate.
you are.  now.
i thought i would need it.
have you seen him?
yes.
what was it then?
of course.
truce?
don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
i haven't been nice to you.
nice.
listen to me...i don't want to lose this piece -
right now?
i'm very, very serious.
i didn't want you to know i was coming.  you heard what happened in my home?
why don't you just go outdoors, mister? cool off.
the loans give the land to your father. it does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  they could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
he got that one right.
i understand, but annie, please...
boeman don't. you know i'm right.
oh, i know. the people are quite taken with her. it's odd, but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, i thought that was clever. but it's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night. once guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. they'll demand we go to war.
yes?
tell her i lied, that i didn't take advantage of her.
you're a fast mover.
i'm not like you, you have your wife.
i've got friends.
yeah, that's what happened...
no, it was a complete waste of time.
yeah, yeah it is, howard. and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn't know.
good.
oh, hey vijay.
better. very much better. i'd like something to wear. and some cigarettes. will you bring me some?
if they're still alive...
it doesn't matter. i think about you every day.
there's nothing to talk about.
who's sophie?
sal, i want my money.
a true friend would do it.
before?  where?  where had you been?
oh no?
who told you we deal drugs?
yes.
it's nice isn't it?
abby... you all right?
there's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
that's fair enough, jabez. man's got a right to mull things over. we'll drive round again, week or so.
hurry up and get dressed.
that's it, we're empty ma'am !
captain rhodes and his red coat bees. they could sting, sister. we know you came up against 'em. we been watchin' you since you landed. couldn't help. i'm sorry for that. we ain't supposed to be outside. if we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
sorry, pard. wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
just. like. jason.
i started seeing things.
sixteen
all right!  very good!  there's a barbarian in there after all!
huh huh. you guys are funny. let's have a drink on it.
thank you, spearchucker. i'll certainly take a look at these. where the hell did you ever get that name?
what?
delly.  i'm... i'm not... harry wasn't my father.  and i'm not... i'm not luke.
mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
look, i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
what'd you have in mind for your next move?
huh? no.
no juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. but we might be able to adapt --
same difference.  if you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
what kind of things, leon?
looks that way, son. guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
you'll be a father any minute now.
i'm going to win this case...mist...mr. doneghy...i'm going to the jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and i'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
not as yet, sir.
for how long?
i'll -- i'll get married. then i'll never be able to go anywhere.
ask her if she knows where he is?
has he eaten anything at all?
he called her.
i look horrible.
i thought i was in...prison again.
what's your game? what do you shoot?
i could get a search warrant.
and what am i? a shriner? no, if you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
look it doesn't matter. it's not important.
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  you seemed as if you liked to talk.  i like to let people talk who like to talk.  it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
shut up!  you're scaring me.  stop!  you're scaring me.
their weapons missing?
so where's plissken?
i suppose.
peter, please...
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...
...both maybe?
it's a surprise.
we remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  y'know why.  cause it's <u>show business</u>. that's why i'm here.  naked girl, covered in napalm. five marines raising the flag, mount suribachi. churchill, v for victory, y'remember the picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  gulf war?  smart bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>one shot</u> of one bomb.  the american people bought that war. m'i getting through to you?  war in the balkans, don't mean nothing, till some g.i. flyer, went down, eating snakes for ten days. n'then it's show business, mister moss.  that's why i'm here.
okay. okay.
anything. anything at all.
but john was with him at the pool?
i'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
goddamn.
this guy, zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. he thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. but he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. you know how to reach me.  take my advice, when dealing with these fbi tight-asses, go by the book. that's what i did.
i want my money back. excuse me.
not at all.  margo, this is eve harrington.
got a minute? i... need a little counseling.  first time for everything. do i... lie down... or what?
still, someone must attend you.  your wife should not have let you out.
say hi for me.
wasn't up to me.
mara...?
oh really.
it's the only way, bud.  now trust me.
far as i know.
"dear sleepless and son..."
yes.
so am i. my friends were killed, too.
how is that...?
i don't believe this sugar shit. something ain't right.
tell me i'll get hurt.  that i might die.  i've already done that.  i don't need anyone's help.  yours included.
this is going to drive the ante up.
shhhhhh.
what about sailing?
right.  get me everything on indonesia, new guinea, all the way to australia.
we'll get back to you.
yeah, you gonna be there?
going into zimmermann's pipeline.
wild doesn't exactly cover it.
with pleasure. won't you sit down?
yeah, well i like to think i'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters.
tom's gone.
never mind. just do what i say. he holds out the baggie. colette backs away.
calculated risk.  only we happen to know, j.j., that you like me.  i'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent.
i beg to differ.  we started a fight we never got to finish. play for blood, remember?
splendid, love to see them.
he has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
yes, sir.
who gives a goddamn what you think? you're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... you're not even a name anymore. just a spear- chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
there are two things i will not put up with during working hours.  one is liquor - and the other one is men.
free, if you're the president.
shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
you know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this hemin fella...to read, so i read it.
i imagine that'd be rather difficult.
probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
it's that v-chip thing that's inside you, eric!  the polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
sure know it wasn't me. and if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, evelyn?
one last time.  it's important ...
is it the good room?
yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just i don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
they'll never take me alive.
they'll in validate the key. probably nothing.
what do you want me to say?
mommy!
i don't care about the team.  i care about the school.
a life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
i'm not going to let this baby die.
hi. what's in the case?
i'm going up to the institute.
well, sure. i'll try to remember. shoot.
i love you now, i'll love you always --
don. help him. help him!! donny!!!!
next friday.
my mom is gone.
if that's your case, you didn't have a case.  i wouldn't believe whatever habighorst said, anyway.
yes! i love that poem. it breaks my heart. i'm so excited you know it.  look, houses in which we don't live.
yes?
elliot litvak. have you been ill? and mr. rogan. how nice.
no way.
i wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw luther. you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, jack.
it doesn't matter.  really.  i'm just sorry you got chewed out.
she didn't like me, anyway.
look, everything's going your way.
great idea.  let me get some shoes. i'll take you home.
you have all this talent, and you waste it. you won't take a single endorsement deal. meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! but no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
my god!  it... it <u>is</u> him!
commander, we are receiving. this is regula i. go ahead.
she can take care of herself. she doesn't need you.
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist?
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. just told me to pick up captain kramer.
where is he?! where is he?!
where is everyone?
i'm sorry, this can't wait.
talk to him, bruce.  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
uh ... thanks.
drink this and stop being silly. why would anyone want to live in this place. you might as well be dead and buried. nothing to do but look at mountains. in a week you'd be talking to yourself.  maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
our little toy. you usually have it up and running by now.
stay forever.
a journal. just have him write down everything he does.
yup. huh huh.
beth shalom? what are you talking about? who is this...?
just regulation size.  we have three like this.
that's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
it's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
yes...
hockney was just a bad bastard. good with explosives. mean as a snake when it mattered .
she's been leaving messages here too.
i hate it when you talk like this.  go on.
it could happen.
you're the one who's not to be believed.
wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
you're serious!
give up, dennis.  let these people go. at least you'll have your life.
it looks....foreign.
i had a temper.
you mean soap?
einstein. had two marriages, both train-wrecks. the guy never saw his kids, one of whom, i think, ended up in an asylum--
is that all you're going to devote your life to?
i'm in construction.
this person and i are a thing of the total past. i promise you.
i joined the navy.
i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father's name is nathan lee morgan, and...
what have you prayed for?
you're talking ancient history, doug. nowadays, traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  look at the statistics.
what line is he in.
he's comin' back? what for?
never heard of a double-cross?
fine.
can you imagine that guy? he was kissing her.
in theory.
waiting -- i'm waiting for news from manchester.
still well on our side...
okay.
yes.
elaine, look, i'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... i'm not gonna have time to come by. i don't know when i can get there.
too christian. you know jameson? paul virilio?
good bye ben.
i'm going completely crazy.
seventy a year.
tell me about it. church will never be the same again.
but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
in that order?
a long time.
yes, you approved it, sir.
you can come back later!
i'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. okay?
the access code's been changed.  your card won't work anymore.
john, it's not your problem what she eats.
agent myers is your new liaison.
you know what i'm going to do?  i'm just going to take a second.  i want to look at the gold.
and how should we do that, sir?
how long is temporarily? i trust not until july.
who cares?
no.
i'd like to commission a work.  i'm a great admirer of yours.
i don't need this... you said tonight and now it's not tonight...
i'm not up for running into anybody. let's just kick it here, alright?
i've done nothing. this is who they are. didn't you know that?
not money.  but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
i don't think she knows.
so do we.  and it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
i... i don't feel any differently.  do you?
you'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
screamer.
a landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
you can't open it yet. you have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
another additional.
...my dad was a compulsive gambler. only he didn't think he was. that applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "losers," who played games of chance. he could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. no matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. and you'd better not point out the obvious.  his creditors would catch up to him. loan sharks or whatever. he'd wake us in the middle of the night. off we'd go, again.
why do you care?
let me call you a car, linda.
all right. good good.  logan i want you right here by the front door. this is the dead bolt key.
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend.
what're you guys doing today?
i think krueger's trying to do something to it.
what happened to it?
no, i don't have time.
you made it out to him last week after he left for chicago.
so did i tell ya?  huh?  nothing to worry about.
i don't want to talk about him.
you print pictures of bigfoot!
you expect me to believe that?
ok!
that was a good one, dad.  that was really something.  remember that?
you shouldn't. he likes you.
bingo! tell the man what he's won!
jesus, first mars, now you.  you two need anti-depressants.
for the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "toby... toby... toby... toby wong... toby wong... toby chung... fuckin' charlie chan." i got madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and toby jap i-don't-know-what, outta my left.
i thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. it turns out to be good-by. why?
because i'm sick and tired of her little games.  because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. because i've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
what is that, mr. bones?[7]
the device has stopped responding.
no. she's in fine shape. nothing to worry about. but she doesn't know. you understand that. she doesn't know what she did.
it's not that easy.
he was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... they shot him.
he's too cool.  too sharp.  i think he's got something to do with it.
and what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, owen?  psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  and we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... i'm in trouble, owen.  i'm losing my faith.
so, why did you take me up there?
you mean, i have to viddy two sessions in one day?
i fell asleep.
i didn't want to come, i didn't want to see all this, but i couldn't stop myself.
i called bucky's. i got her a cab. is there any hot mustard?
i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "if you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." and i'm laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag.
how do you do, belle? how are you, jabez?  well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
what's up?
it's all up to kathryn.  amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
last time i plugged it in, i suppose. why?
i am going after them.
i heard you were looking for me.
i like you, jerry.  a lot.
sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
i want to go to his place.
stopped by to see otto. say hello.
he's here.  check the bathroom.
...then some.
he was at the campground yesterday.
everything's too hard.  maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own, but not now i don't.
there, that's better.
i can see your small business ! look at it it's so small.
no, it's our house! just tonight --  -- we're david and ruth laskin. which one do you want to be? i prefer to be ruth but i'm flexible.  alcohol! you make drinks. i'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth. i'm ruthless at the moment.
i don't know. i'm just a d.a. i don't have access to all you expert sources.
is that a threat?
you will protect me as you always have, d'artagnan.
don't. i know what you're going to say.
to assist you i have retro-fitted your helmets with new opti-scan devices.
he's coming back, mom!  he's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
colored.
cougar, you're on the ball.
the big one. the one that's most on your mind.
enough.
watcha gonna see?
well, i didn't mean it.
i don't think that's true.  i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny... and i'd like to know what they are.
on earth -- no.  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna.
but you must!  i can't do it alone. i'm not at all like my father.  i'd never make it.
what do you want for it?  two thousand? three thousand?
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
leave that one lay.
shhh, you be the long distance operator.  here.
i appreciate your concern. let's leave it at that.
aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
you must listen to me before you go.
don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
don't be an idiot!  you're in no fit state to go anywhere.
but you better hurry.
yes?
the lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
you can tell a man by his friends.
no, i'd slip out past the hotel district, behind greyhound...
watch clark.
the play? all right, i guess...
how are you, jane?
is he alright?  what happened?
fuck you.
i don't know, he quit dealin' but i'll bet he'll smoke us out.
goodbye.
no, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  um... <u>later</u>.
...what are they doin' right now...?
if you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... don't turn away from love, sailor... don't turn away from love... don't turn away from love.
no.
yes!  yes!  oh, lord!  yes, oh, yes! but  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
no!....
what?  tony and china, together?
i'm sure you can handle it.  now i want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from marine to 30th.  foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
it must be great.
because you’ll be here.
it's not that. i mean mouthing off to your teachers. i'll admit... when dad told me what you said to ms. farmer, i laughed my ass off.
wouldn't bother me.
i deduced it. once you walked in.
sure i do, you know, like your aura. that you give off.
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate...
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
i dunno what i can do to help you?
look special agent moonan... we don't know what you're talking about.
such as?
maybe he's hiding from something.
my name's larry mitchell. i live in vancouver.
plus what i owe you?
well, shoot, man! whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney?  she wasn't even mentioned in marsh's will.
a crazy madman.
you're red hot, damn it. get in there. i've got to get more ice.
what do you want?
yeah.  i meant... you know what i'm going to do with it?  i'm going to buy a sixty- three 'vette stingray.  all tricked out and cherry.  i'm going to be so sweet.
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. i'll be long gone. besides, who's going to believe you? you're just a two-bit crook.
smug, trip! not snug, smug.
it's like they're just people i work with and our job is being popular and shit.
answer what?
where's west? new jersey?
i give that marriage six months.
so he really loved her?
joe saracini. he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. that was in 1952.
really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
how do you know?
oh, for heaven's sake.
another accident?  you got to be more careful.
thank god he was born an orphan. it would have killed his parents.
one likes to live simply.
congratufuckinglations.  that makes you last to go.  but don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  always does.
you're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but i assured him...
that was gas, sweetie.
i thought i saw a black widow spider.
they did 14 grand in evanston, 16.5 is gary, and 20 in cicero.  looks like you're bringing up the rear, granger.
now why shouldn't you, walter? things are different now...
i'm sorry, i only...
why albania?
just shut up.
well, i kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
my lord, wendell, it's just all-out war. i  don't know any other word for it. who are these folks? i don't know...
okay.  what's up?
no police!  wait until i'm gone.
can you describe it, deanna?
we got company. female company.
i am.  you-you made my day.
what?  what are you talking about?
there was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
you mean inner space is endless?
no, no.
well, i'll be an alabama porch monkey's uncle.
... okay... you made your point.
wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
they busted me last week.
brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. the smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
sakwa!
it was like tommy was possessed or something. there was a hate in his eyes that i couldn't really call human.
why yes, mr. dillon. here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
that's typical of your daughter. takes those things for granted.  why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami—  for the love of it?
all right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
mam, it's my truck. i know my own capacity.
when you get back, i'll be gone --
jody, you have to go to the party. for your own safety.
hell, yes!  what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler?
my dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
then i'm your man.  come on, toots.
i hate peas.
you're a friendly lady, miss johnson.
how?
yeah, really.
why?  you got money from dolores' insurance with the school board.  we all did.
whatever it is.  go <u>do</u> it.  how you doing on the permit?
yeah ... well, yours. you still don't believe that you're the princess, do you?
fuck off.
they're on the next level up.
what's your brand?
did we ever use those costumes for the border patrol? those guys in the leopard-skin <u>hats</u>?  here's my idea....
i gotta get to english class.
hhhuh. so we decoy her. stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
i don't believe it.
you're right.
four o'clock. don't be late.
i'm not here.
the man is a traitor!
you freed it, son?
jerry...?  <u>jerry</u>.
the name should be eddie. what should my name be?
depends, who pays?
no, i'm sure we'll be fine.
goddamn you! that's trespassing!
this isn't what we agreed on. you guys have to take care of... this! you are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
and what did your team do...
very funny.
detour.  other way's blocked...
i like frank. he's a good boy. me and him's made friends.
i'm listening.
let's see.
i don't know. i thought this is what you wanted. you want stability, here it is.
aren't you?
they'll be there when we get there. might even have a fire started.
no...  it's all right. i got it. don't worry about it.
i understand you perfectly. you leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
you and...luis?
i didn't mean it that way  i'm sorry.
hi.
like a piece of shit? in my eyes, you are a piece of shit. think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now? i could say you jumped when i came in. who are they going to believe? not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
no, i mean the father! who's the father, juno?
you're sure right. it is a strange world.
i'll see you at the office.  good night.
eleven b street, northeast. take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
if you are killed in the matrix, you die here?
will you get the fuck out of here.
i've been preoccupied.
who told you?
don't start worrying about him. he's a good guy, but screwy.
look, it's either you or the rent and i don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
oh, that's right. isn't that nice? i hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than derek summersby.
you want to be like that, swann? mud and shit?
it's not my fault.  i didn't invite them.
how about i pick one out for you?
what happened?
what's your cut?  how much?
she's at the premiere of "a cold day in hell".  but i think she send someone from acquisitions.
well, i am saying it.  bring in the jury.
well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this st. peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
close, but no cigar.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
he didn't "ditch" me.  we had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it.
we own a small family grocery store.
...i'm going to need your help...
what if he's not?
there might have been a word or two that slipped by.  maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
is something wrong? what's happened to your face?
i have waited forever for this. you will not cheapen it, little boy.
well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
what do you think -- i should be carrying a torch for you?
long as we don't lose heart, jack...
who then?
i'm an information gatherer. you wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
home is where the heart is.
you don't have to know all this by saturday. it took me years.
first friday of the month?  linens. roll right off the trucks.  they're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  traffic will be smooth.
i don't think it's working.
it must be done right away.
you could tell she took care of herself. she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
he's going home.  he slept over because i was a little anxious...
call off your watch-dogs you said.
it's really not up to you, harry. but we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
well, what kind of answer are you looking for, ann? what is it exactly that you want to know?
misty, i made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
oh yeah, like he even noticed.
attention all units. we've got him. he's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
but then you'll forget about me.
oh honey, let's.
how could you say that?  you're a beautiful woman. you're destroying yourself. you don't need that stuff. you don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. i know you better than you know yourself. you're a tiger, you're stronger than i am. and when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  you can do it.  you can do it.
where'd they go?
i thought so.
we'll figure something out.
if i hadn't done it.  if i'd said to myself, "screw it.  i'm going to let all those people down there live."
what is that supposed to mean?
an overheated car.
i know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but i'm there in the dark with you, bud you're not alone...
look, you gotta stand up for yourself. learn to fight back.
you remember that boy who lost his mind, joe? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. he wouldn't miss a one. make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. he would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
i'm afraid it's the "van" again.
there won't be a next time, i guarantee it.
i don't want to come here anymore.
ask away, sweet man.
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
what's that, son?
patriotism is its own reward.
no.
what's she doing in california?
you don't even know how much it is.
a private investigator?
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i'm living on an isolated ridgetop with delores?
no!
it's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  when i got here, the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
that's something a man could do...?
it's still a good idea.
i don't mean fernando.
did i?  i don't recall... i got lots of kids from that place --
what do you mean, i wasn't there? i remember distinctly . . .
never mind that, where are we now.
the empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for rambouillet.  marshals mortier and marmont are probably still in paris, completing the arrangements.
oh!
it's a whozis?
you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
good lad, ringo.
you ever done this before?
i do about three-fifty, four.
what do you want me to say, gwen?... they wanted the commander.
calm down, benjamin.
you're hurtin', man!
we can.
how sweet.  is that when you put the move on her?
i'm told you've asked for a bureau cross-check of flight records to and from el paso, ft. myers, omaha, the murman murder time frames.
the retard over at molly's fruit stand.
is there a song you don't know?
junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
you wanna get us busted? if max found out you were turning tricks --
look, she's right.  we'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. i feel... confident.  c'mon.
what business?
oh, i didn't notice, where'd he go?
we think he could'a been involved, yeah.  you know him?
actually, no.  i feel a little out of place.
i found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
they told me to practice.
probably is.
mom... when is the war gonna be over?
changed?
tom?
they're still dirty. and their bite is septic. look at that ...
ha ha.  no, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, but someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
you gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
sulu! look! the sun's come out! it's a miracle!
fishing?
who's this?
yeah.
you tell me that in front of these creeps?
no woman would!
there's explanations. rational explanations for everything that's happened. we'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
i'll be right there.
so you're cloverleaf?
then go get him.
what time is it?
the nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
shermin!! shermin!!!
well nobody's perfect...
is mom yelling at you too?
but i understand her. that may be more important.
how do you mean, strange?
i don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a labrador.
if i understand what you meant by that.
two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
hmmm. claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her. i told her that wasn't true, i just knew the event horizon better, that's all.
just until we get things under control.
her 'head'?! you're making this up...
near alexandria. it isn't in alexandria, it is outside it.
this sounds threatening.
why george, you big softie...
i said drown 'em all! who is that?
no! oh god.
"don?"
they were out of line --
do not interrupt!!! do not speak lightly of the spice... one small point...
good.
you're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
no... donnie, wait. i've never...
thank you.
we talk different?
hey.
again, i thank you.
i can hire workers to help me.
earl williams. the reprieve.
...yeah. you're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
oh, man, i've never eaten so good in my life.  why don't you develop a useful skill?
he didn't waste it.
why would you suppose so?
oh, fuck you! fuck you, sam rothstein!  fuck you!
sombitch and i ain't never been to beantown.
yeah.
warm?  man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like tommy hearns.  no, i ain't talking any business in here.  to me this is holy ground, man.  you understand?  i got to be someplace anyway.  y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. the state theater.
hey, don't worry. chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
how long will they watch us for?
homicide.
my brother.
you're the one who's hand is shaking.
put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
i'm not leaving without that tape.
uh-huh.
how everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  i used to be scared shitless i'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
hm...
wrong! your ears you keep, and i'll tell you why --
i don't know, jabez.
yes.
you can't win like this.  you'll only get older.  this is what you wanted!
would you watch the damn road?
what is that?
the same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  he's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
no problem.
no, honey... it was part of the deal.
where is he?
take it easy.
he's my dad.
i can't believe you didn't check.
i never stop thinking about it, detective.  the only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
my god, it's a mansion!
this is bigger. seven years to the day. no blackouts.
--i look and look in the tree, all i ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
i used to drive a taxi.
he bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
if it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
don't you dare.
i... just knew. a husband knows.
the stiff one eye?
remember last night i was talking to you and i was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  do you remember?
its bad for you.
no - it's showgirls.  i've been married seven or eight times.
what sorry? what you got? you lose my money?? ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
i will be here in the room, waiting for you. the safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. you will be wearing rubber gloves. do you own rubber gloves?
oh, but it's a good story, shadow. you're depriving our famous young friend here...
yup.
you- they cannot believe you're still here.
hush. no, it is never terrible to be in love. nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  i'm not sorry she killed him either. nathan was wonderful. he was erudite and sophisticated and charming. you are all that, too. but you have something more. you have a bit of the animal in you.
and that's exactly what he's going to do.
there's got to be an explanation!
i was in the city.
it's your best play, nicky.
whatever. but you... i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. so why this?
you better get some fresh air.
how can we?  we're broke.
what time is it?
anybody got any?
modred has treated with the dark ones.
what?
all i'm askin' is...
you going to tell dad?
perfect.
how come you never got married again?
shit.
but you don't agree?
did he say where?
what's april 16th?
no, but come on guys, we made a pact!
dr. gruber.
bullshit.
sure.
i've been thinking about getting tattoo. you know, a flower or something. on my ass.
ten here.
shut up!
how come we never got together ?
what are you doing here?
people don't want a champion.  they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
tomorrow?  can i have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
fuckin' a! we got a five hour drive back to la ahead of us. <b> ext. macdonald's -- parking lot -- moments later </b> choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back parking lot of the macdonald's. alf is hosing him down. domino stares at choco... admiring his body.
i guess by the bed.
wow. that's big. i mean sex is a really big deal. you shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
father's . . . i never knew he had a diary.
she died giving you to me.  and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
blue moon...
you are sweet.
you mean the menacing red car?
careful, lad.
yeah, i guess.
well -- i'm sure you think you do, ben, but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
bert! thank heaven you're here!
what time?
hell, no.  i hate lawyers.  i just work for them.  you got a minute?
this is... really a shock...
my pleasure, al... always happy to help out in a pinch...  excuse me. i better call my service... tell them where i am.
yeah. yes. i don't follow music too much.
for munro children?
i like talking about it.  at least, to you.
could i speak to you in private?
if kat's not going, you're not going.
yeah.  this could be the one we're looking for.
oh yeah.  between here and vegas we get a lot of customers.  all types.  even had an officer, just like you.
but i did not deal with it, sir. i let it prevent me from helping my friend.  does that make me a coward?
i understand you only too well. you let them do it, as i let lestat turn a child into a demon. as i let her rip lestat's heart to pieces! well i am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. your melancholy spirit of this century! i know what i must do. and i warn you - you saved me tonight, so i return the favour - do not go near your cell in the theatre des vampires again.
fine.  oh, we went to the caravaggio exhibition at the met.  it's such a treat to go through a museum with frederick.  i mean...you learn so much.  do you like caravaggio?
not until the man calls.
i don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
you're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
he must be tired -- this bontecou thing --
what for?
i'm infected with chimera.  you know you don't have a choice.  just do it now.
hey, what is this-an interview? we're supposed to be making love.
damn it, man! you're talking about my mother!
five thousand.
and as treasurer, you could release those funds?
because they said it couldn't be done.
she's very beautiful.
how long ago?
i'd never get an abortion.
you want the tape?  there it is!
they tore her dress! ...
-- i don't know, i feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and i love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
good morning.
uh huh...
what do you want?
-- here we go -- i found it --
get out.
how long has this been going on?
show us where you are, chief.
well we don't.
i know what it meant... and i'm prepared to make it up to you.  i will make changes; i can.  i can change; that i have learned, that i have the strength to change... and we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
why?
we did it.
mr. powers, please. i know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. i would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
what do you mean?
checking out your place.
she just came up for a drink. just for a few minutes.
yes he is.
candy. candy, over here.  hey, doc, time out.
there aren't any little boys on your floor.
and what was the weather like at this time?
i thought i'd listen to some of the tapes. see what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
right, exactly!
i've lost my knack.
either i'm going to tie you or mars will tie you.  which do you want?
how could i know what's in the archive?
yes, ma'm...
no, mama, i'll take care of it. i'll wash them in the morning.
does this help?
no, thomas. i have never been in an automobile.
there's other guys as good as me, loomis.
why not?
don't tell me what to do.
last night.
'cos he fucking told me. he thinks it's funny. he's laughing at you.
i'll see you there.
too much fame.  yeah, i guess that'd turn anybody's head. including yours.
remember how we were?
bet your ass i have. it's an important job, neighborhood watch is.
you're not like him at all.  i don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
what about tomorrow?
you're not takin' amy.
me neither.
five bucks an hour. that's the going rate, isn't it?  it's a quarter past two now. my wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. if you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
i don't know, it depends.
adenoids?
finish what?
"you're gonna die tonight, faggot". clear as day.
and what does jennifer think's real?
she wasn't really my wife.
he had a yacht?
you bring me the heart of the jesuit general, and you will have a palace of your own.
the what?
and everybody, all the time. yeah, it's a chore.
yeah, injun. what do you want?
how about that.
no strings.
no doubt, brother - i figured as much back there in the restaurant. that's why i invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
tomorrow -—
it's okay with arnie... come on, let's go.
yeah, i know. it's kind of weird. out of context.
thank you. excuse me.
of course.
ask him.
never one.
<i>i once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
john bonham?
discourage it.  but stay with her if you can't.  call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  she's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
yes.
no one's gonna blame you. c'mon. take my hand and save yourself, carolyn.
go on, beat it!
it was you there?
why did you agree to come here?
i told you, man.  she my fine little surfer gal.
what gave you that idea?
okay?
it was a veal stock, i thi...
if anyone's going, i could use some coffee.
well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
yeah?  well, don't expect the toons to give you a gold watch.
that's what i mean.
the plague to end all plagues, agent mulder. a silent weapon for a quiet war. the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. they've been working on this for fifty years. while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon.
i dress up when i want to make an impression. - so how'd it go?
otis what?
von der null?
i borrowed it from this guy i know. so?
c'mere, i'll show you.
oh great, tell her that! now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
i'm gonna go! three...two...one...
i did.
i'm fine, right. fit as a fucking fiddle.
request permission to beam aboard immediately.
yes.
oh...
narcissus!
yes....
fine.
ten thirty?
it's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics?
three seasons.  they found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail.  i was wife number three -- the ingenue.
no, it isn't. i'm getting a divorce.
look up, sunshine
thought you were another wife, maybe.
make someone bleed.
with or without 'em.  twelve--noon. the senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
and we all went through that together?
oh, i don't know. up-tight. frigid.
i just want to double check the facts.
yes, hindu dances, thank you, sergeant. this is the first opportunity we've had of making an american author welcome.
sure you are.  you're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
what?
i couldn't be more serious, jack. those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
you're in oklahoma?!
pick up your cards and let's go.
oh, trying to frame me, eh! i never saw this woman before in my life!
good!  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
so we on the same page then?
amy...
turn around.  now!
twenty-nine.
classic!  thank god. she says 'yes!'
you tell everyone about sammy. everyone who'll listen. "remember sammy jankis, remember sammy jankis". great story. gets better every time you tell it. so you lie to yourself to be happy. nothing wrong with that - we all do. who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
where did you find those?
yes.
i'll hide.
you're very protective of him, randal. you always have been.
bring your rifles, that's all.  take us to him.
you live and learn. i realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
jesus.  two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
so, what? eleven?
give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
i'm going back to the institute.
oh boy.
machine's screwed up, i can't tell. needle's spinning all over the dial.
i'll leave this afternoon. happy?
the king of england.  i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there.
you love him?
oh, jesus... how?
the woman i saw you with...
i mean it.  from what i can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
in what way do you mean?
absolutely nothing. the blizzard always came straight with his messages. but wrap your minds around this one.
at least you have a mother.
i thought you didn't recognize me.
the united nations. madmen are on the streets, paul. but i will take care of you.  your cellar is well-stocked, right?
like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
show you?
that ain't no crime
fine, i just --
how many people really know what they want though?  i mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? but inside, they don't really know, so, i don't know.  but i know that i don't know.
yeah.
oh! ho! okay. you wanna go?
we have to find sophie.
perfecto!
i heard.  local 15, monday nights.
hanukkah, shmanukkah. it isn't even one of the high holidays. what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl.  i'll make you a deal. i'll help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai.
i know.  do you think if something happened, it happened there?
yeah.  thanks.
and even if it weren't, why fly? where would it get you?
you work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  just be thankful you're not working for household.  the queen never lets them out of her sight.  but wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
i don't need a dentist. somebody hit me, that's all.
yes, jacqueline. you were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
aye.
hook you up?  the mau-mau's?  you must be smoking.  why in the world would i want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
looking for someone.
lila?
yes, but i wouldn't...
please excuse leah. she's mentally challenged.
as a matter of fact--i am home.
have you been replaced?
it won't be that hard.
it has it's moments.  course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
how come you took so much interest in her, dr. darling?
yeah...i think so.
what's her name?
average.
well daddy and i are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
he'll slow down.
no.
what two policemen?
then after that it's safe.
full stop and fire !
sleeping in the back.
yes.
what do you think?  what's this?
yes.
november, i thought.
it is clearly federation in origin, captain.
c'mon, i say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...maybe spend the night?
i'm fine....
if i'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
why?
none.
fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
be that as it may. u is for unconditional election. god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, the elect, and he has chosen them from the beginning of time. l is for limited atonement. only a limited number will be atoned, will go to heaven.
well, why don't you take it out of your account? there's a lot there.
i had to excuse myself from a meeting. it's ridiculous. i kept thinking about the baby... you... and, i swear, i was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. you know that france has recognized the soviet.
hey, it's... been two years --
what do you got on korda?
when?
in other words.
what can i tell you, kid? you're right. when you're right, you're right, and you're right.
me neither. that's why i wear briefs... so why did you and... mark break up?
i don't know what you mean.
would you like to stay for dinner?  there aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. so would i.
oh, you're welcome. nice to finally meet you, jeffrey.
what did you find?
put that down. it's dirty.
is that good or bad?
you cheap honky sonofabitch...
you know.
if he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
four cases in three years...
oh cuervo...
i said we'd see.  and as it is, i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  when you've saved it up again, i'll let you go.
i feel sorry for him.
you do.
vivian...
i didn’t say he was worth it.
her name was maggie muldovan.
i... i...
the population must increase with great rapidity.  we give a couple seven years to raise a family. if, by that time, there is no branch upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel.
thank you.
look on the back. what do you see?
because she's the type.
go ahead, jam.
ain't over yet.  night is part of day; separate, but equal.  night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
once more! 
don't worry, eddie, no one knows i'm here.
maybe.
because you and the land are one.
*used* to be. not no more. i lost the call.  but boy, i sure *used* to have it! i'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners i pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  but not no more. i lost the sperit.
that ain't gonna work.
and me coming in with two pair-- 
about an hour, maybe two.  let's see -- i came on about eight....
and it's such a handsome head. please frank, and i swear i'll buy one of your paintings.
and leave me down here???
nothing does. still. i want him to like me.
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
that!
i know who you are, doctor venkman.  busting any ghosts lately?
i hate you.  i totally hate you.
yeah right.
i believe that decision rests with her majesty.
hey, rookie.  be cool.  just stay with me.  this is what we do.
out.
so get the fuck outta here.
so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat. he wanted to play with me.
and then, in the war, to kill and hide. that's all.
--the canuck letter--was that a white house operation--
1899.
hunt with vince?
she was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
get me a dr. peppa!  i don't want no pepsi.  pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
how do we do that?
history, leonard.  <u>history</u>. everything else is conversation...  how's the other matter?
drugs...  then jason came. he's here, sean.
excuse me?
ted... you're not that far ahead.
the blast?  honey, i have survived a host of things. like the song says: "a country boy can survive!"
no thank you.  i need to get my car back.
that cop!  why'd you have to do that?  you couldn't wound him?  the guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
fries.
what if it was?
i know.  me neither.
what crook?
couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
we catch 'em, i wanna be first to hurt 'em.  promise me i get to go first.
no, for you! how old are you, billy?
you... don't have to... leave.
i've got a wife, mary. kids. you know that.
because he was a brave man - because i liked him -- i came here to be sure.
look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
no.
not out the other side his face, though.
when there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? u. mass, amherst, b.u....
vat? i am going 5 miles an hour! i am looking town. i not even moving.
yes, i did.  poor impulse control. the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  you'll never catch him that way.
i know, i know. just don't hit me.
oh.  i thought today was saturday.
no, it's the truth.
they all are. football's on.
of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
my companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about england, which i answered as best i might.  but this best, i am bound to say, was bad enough.  i knew nothing about england, and i invented a thousand stories which i told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
is that all this conversation means to you?  am i going to put out or not?
what are you going to do?  hide me?
what manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  why would he do it?
all right.
could.
who are you? hitler's hall monitor?
claire?
yeah, sure -- she's very excited.
-- and read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
it's a very sad business, i tell you. a woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. it's a curse to be a mother, i tell you. your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? what is a mother's life but her children? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
i'm sorry to hear that.
what? be my body guard?  here's my body, theo. guard it. for my dad's sake. for your career. sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
you know me.  i pick things up real fast.
i just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
it’s friday night, jane. what happened to your latest boyfriend?
hiya, ralph...
turn left at the lights.
what was your name again?
i wasn't sure you were the same. let's see, the last time we met --
they found your car in the garage.  they are going to tow it away.
he is? i didn't think you knew dick. how do you know he's dead?
how is it you can look at that hairhead and see god, when all i see is a lucky asshole from reseda.
i don't know.
well, are you? are you queer?
who did?
no.  i'm going home.
soon. we're going to branson, missouri to see my cousin emma married. frank loves in there.
it was unbelievable!  un-fucking- believable!
uh, eleven twenty-five.
in the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  i don't think we should call dr. bright.
i... they're all dead, bud.  they're all dead. i thought... some of them... you know...
bad luck. what's the exposure like?
killed last night, in a tavern! come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
you shut up!  they're beautiful, but get them some water.
yes i can...
yes, you're right.  it will be done.
thank you.
don't go, jackie...
mi jesus esta muerto!
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic.  pardon me.  excuse me, sorry, sorry...
my team.  claire, jack, even jim - - hannah, maybe, i -- donít know
what chu listening to rumors for? i'm not like dat.
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. they can't even find him.  i tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
it wasn't her mother.  the only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
int. brynner's van - day. 
give me absolution.
the man in jail is always for freedom.
okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, i guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! you know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on sunset boulevard. goodbye, sunny.
is that... one person?
aristotle.
isn't there an escape pod on this ship? something?
no.
-- alleged crime --
no prob, i could use the company. i've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
this is it!  this is it!  quiet, quiet, quiet!
good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
we're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'reform the reds with a rope'.
what plate?
not on the landscape. we're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
l-lies... at first. about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' little bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on ned an' ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
are the coordinates set?
she's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
okay, just calm down. it's going to be okay.
lots of ideas.  no good ones.
we're going to keep driving.
wait!
yes.
coming.
believe me, that won't be a problem.
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie's.
i don't know...
lemme see.
i'm a forensic specialist, molly. you've seen my diploma?  i got a diploma and everything.
the last i looked, we were just talking things over.
i drove to st. cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound. and i wound up staying for a couple of hours.
one of the fathers was on the tv saying, "my child was not a bum."  and it's playing like gangbusters.  hell, hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
why 're you doing this?
very well ...
don't you see carla?  i made them immortal.
what about you? you haven't eaten in days. how come you're never on this side of the microscope?
dad i'm kidding, you can have the room.
what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
and we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
i couldn't rest —- i couldn't sleep. all i could see was teresa delgado's body -- broken --mangled. i saw it day and night.  it was waiting everywhere i turned.
really?  do you have a favorite piece?
come on!
edvard!   i haf question 'bout script. my vife greta, she read.  and she no like.
which ones?
i just don't think we have the right to ...
let's go.
pardon me—
what fake blind date? what are you talking about?
then why don't you . . . do something about it!
i'm sorry.  please, carla.  i didn't think there was any danger.  i'm sorry. i love you.  both of you.
yes. absolutely. despite your crass behavior, i'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
chaz -- what happened to broussard?
what?!
he'll give the better mark.  i am not afraid of him.
what?  no i'm not.
jim, i've got to go.  i'm already late--
it was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
yes sir.
yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. you ever hear of eight-minute abs?
well, you had better!!
hey, don't be ridiculous.
what are my orders?
equals?
better to kill than be disturbed.
no.
oh, sugar.  you're going to spoil my surprise.
who's fault is it then if it's not yours? you're the one in charge, daddy.
i broke up with my roommate -- he was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
`they lied.'  indeed!  when did they lie?  and do you know what a lie is?
okay, you got me. it's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
what is that?
yessir. none of the three had id on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is mexicans. was mexicans.
listen, matt. if you don't tell the truth, i can't help you. where were you last night?
you didn't do anything to the monitors, did you mac?
swell's here, johnny.  bodhi always knows.
why would anybody want to hurt you?
what, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
what about the sender?
i suppose it is.
harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
yes, i believe that's right.  now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. highly infectious.
constantly.
yah, the loudmouth. so the whole state has it, lundegaard and gustafson?
how do you think i'm doing?
yeah, why not? we're the good guys.
that's great.
i hope.
turns out you did me a favor. you're looking at a rich man.
where are you?  i been trying to reach you.
fuck you.
invisible!
what is this, uncle billy? a holiday?
mary, when you first came here, i told you to look into your heart. you didn't listen to me. you listened to the policeman instead. you didn't find your sister, did you?
you're right.  easy come, easy go.
the tank will be finished by morning...
yeah. why, you know him?
thank goodness.  breaktime.
then who's the banker?
okay.
look, erin, this is not the way i do business, this extortion nonsense.
not this time.
well now there's a compliment.
the flu.
you're a wonderful writer, miles. don't be discouraged.
i'm the one they'd be looking for.
i'm all wet.
is there something i can do to help you?
ow!
lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
whatever that means elena -- and you complain about me not communicating... i thought it was --
it's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
all of them?
fenster and hockney?
she wouldn't...
yvonne hasn't been herself, either. locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
thank god, the police.
what is this?  where's reed?
okay, brother.
maybe she found him like that.
crude and defiant as always, triple x. it fits so well because you're obscene.
what are you talking about?
can i go day after tomorrow?
rene's been telling me about your work.
her maid's house. i think she knows something's up.
hey bud! finger here.
i should go to the house, get breakfast.
it's midnight. one half of paris is making love to the other half. look at the clock. one hand has met the other hand. they kiss. isn't that wonderful?
it's not your concern.  it's... business, that's all.
well, dr. zira? this is a man, is he not?
she's going home to new york.  i need some ice.
wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  i mean... da vinci virus, didn't phreak say that's what he was being charged with? look...  "infecting ballast programs of ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
yeah. seems maranzano wants to talk about buying the merchant street warehouse.
me? - if i'm worried about anyone, it's you. what happened to you, sam? you were the brightest of us -
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  you had another nightmare, didn't you?
yes, you have a suit i've had my eye on.
i'm gonna hate it.
sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
yeah, but we're talking 43.
student?
yeah?  and what about my enemies?
no, it's getting worse.
it came from across the lake.
can i ask you something?  didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  so what changed?
nah!  what's he got? this is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. it's not the money. not for you. why can't i get ahold of it?  cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
and when was the last time she put herself out for you?  look, john, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
parents? nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
i want to come back.
this--this is a great honor, sir. i-- i--
how's frederick?  he didn't come.
frank, you know as well as i do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
your client is guilty. don't dick around with me.
yes.
they'll make it look like an accident...
exactly.
well, lemme sing the one i picked an' see what you think...  "when there's a fire in your heart/break the glass/sound the alarm..."
what?
ay-eh...made out i was crazy...  ate dirt...chewed grass...i fooled 'em, ethan!...an' i got away...
whish the circumstances were different.
actually, she's silver-haired.
stand aside, son. any more takers?
your girl friend's name is ralph?
...and everyone lived happily ever after.
you followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
is there anything you want to know about me, mr. wigand...?
i, uh...
nice going, honey.  it was brand new.
well, if i do find out something, can i look you up again?
mr. d. b. norton!
let me finish. can i finish?
i promise.
when will i see you again?
but we're not on my planet, are we?
it's only a tale.
knock yourself out.
oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?
shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
i'll have a highball.
it's irrelevant. it had nothing to do with what happened.
well, if you do, you'll let us know?
fine...maybe i'll come by later.
whatever gave you that idea?
she didn't take it from you, did she?
that’s where you work.
everybody's divorced.
all right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and i'll talk to the judge!
no! no problem, there is no...  what is the problem? just do that... thing... you do! come on! you drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
nice ... nice ...
hm?
i'm not gonna fire you.  i wanted to.  but then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  you embarrassed me, erin.
do yourself a favor, norman.  are you listening?  don't tell anyone what you just told me.
let me demonstrate some examples.
did i forget something?
sure.
don't sulk.  what brought all this on?
yeah.
color me educated. i learned high school happiness is for members only, pauline fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's heather james. also, j.d.'s a major creep.
yeah, well if i claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? jesus... the cops were probably right. my uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
i only have your word for that.
no, i'm awake. what's the matter?
for them. but for me --
and then?
if i stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her madame butterfly routine--
i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?
dmitri?
you're not serious.
yes, shit. oops, sorry!  sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
thank you for calling me taylor.  dr. zaius, i know who i am. who are you? how did this upside down civilization ever get started?
it's not so much.
it's not for sale.
do you know when she'll be back?
listen to what i've ... listen to... does anybody know morse code?
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
the most unpredictable piece on the board. and always ready to protect his queen.
it's the treasure, that's what it is.
but he's seven. what kind of stress can he have?
will they take asking price?  i need a two week escrow and i'm already approved for the loan.
that's awful generous of you. i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
nope, there!  that's one.
no... i told you.
give me twenty minutes.
see you later.
what do you need?
i think the building's okay. at least for the time being.
a long way from home. you be careful out there.
and why was the alarm on?
are you mad?  katharine loves it here. she told me yesterday.
uh-huh.
sure.
well, what are we gonna do about it now?
what? whatta you mean, no? who is -- who is telling you? whatta you mean, no? yes, you'll wear pink or else. or else you'll wear pink.  and, darlin', oh, i'm gonna take you to coney island.
you must.
just do what i say, bob.
tell me what?
i'm saying things got out of hand.  maybe they did take advantage of her!.  maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  no charges were brought.  and the bottom line is, rina reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  you wanna get ahead in hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
you sent that?
who was next? clyde? or was it...?
you want me to show up late a few nights?
this is business.  there was an accident in maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
i'm not going to marry anybody.
please go away.
come on.
is she as pretty as you?
what the hell is this?  who are you?
we <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
all right, tell us, rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
i've put extra men on, all along the way.
i've never been in there. they just jumped you out of the blue?
stop complaining.
that's just about the dumbest thing i ever heard, wizard.
look, if you don't mind, i haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
oh we're not going to the campus.
he only weighs ten ounces --
no, sir. you can kick me out, but i'm not quitting.
what's your name?
amen to that.  the supermarket's full of assholes.
when i have fifty pounds.
no!  whatever talent simone has comes from me -- me!  me!  i swear, as god is my judge.  you don't know what i've been through.  tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  why do you think i've been wearing these?  i may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  to extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  don't you see?  i made simone!
good.  total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  let's play catch.
you...  ...fell into the bay.
no.
i always told ya, frances. you got real ability.
i still think she sails above the rest. i mean not like her early films.  but those were all such great directors.
i couldn't let him interfere with my project.
i just did.  can you make them do tricks?
there's only so much technology can do.  thanks for the beer.
pretty good... made a quick trip to oregon, saw my brother and the kids. figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
so what are you saying?
i don't know.
yeah, i'm cool.  see you later.
fuck off!
luke, you got to listen to me. all you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
why?
what d'ya want to do to kill time?
i wish i still thought like you.
the kid is amazing.
i need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
you know, m.j., when i watch you shoot, i realize i've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
a week ago, i bought a rifle.
he <u>was</u> a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
just settling an old score. you might say revenge.
fine, thank you. did you watch the show?
i'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
oh jesus.  oh jesus christ.
i'll leave the casino soon.  i promise.
yes, sir!
if it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
it's alright.
i guess so.
but this time they'll be ready.
well, let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. do you go along with this belief?
hey, cool tiger. looks proud.
donna?
come, come, sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. nothing's going to happen.
for what?
you?! how about me?
shall we go inside? i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
are you crazy?
bet they don't dust crops in japan.
knox!  what are you doing here?
i told you ... i can't. i just -- it doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
you don't exist any more. i've killed you. jill layton is dead.
you know, i had a crazy dream last night. it was about you.
we know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. i'm offering you the chance to call this off.
you look alike.
sure, but is that it for the list?
so you think the dissertation will get published?
yes.
abdul-shabazz?
it worked!  there they go!
yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
that i am very little different from him.
no jocks?  a twenty-game winner or a masters champion?  someone i could talk to.  or would talk to me.
that's not a piano.....i have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
i failed to resolve the situation.
no english lord would trust an irishman!
you're kidding.
what the hell kind of cop are you ?
i need you to let me talk to mr. smith.
leo fast elk... is alive.
who're you?
sit down.
promise?
yes.
keeping our witnesses alive.  we hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
i wasn't born yesterday. now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy --
hell no!!! that's the last thing we need... a buncha cops runnin' around.
normal.
i am harold ryan, her husband.  i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  i have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i'll let you know immediately. good luck.
ask your man here.
what's the problem?
guy i work with.
soon as i finish my coffee.
no argument here. insubordination rules.
it doesn't matter what we call ourselves. we know who we are.
i'm honored to know this man.
storage.
i stopped that!
you're from liverpool, aren't you?
yes?
dead.
that unit no longer functions. i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise.
do you share my madness?
what?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
for as long as i can remember.
be polite. say hello.  this is candy.
thank you, mr. murphy. we'll let you know.
nothing.
i'm... really sorry.
damn!  this will get him.
then i'll be there for you.
my client... is dead.  but i think he's a free man.
i improved on the fucking original.
you mentioned that he had a learning disability.
a diseased monster.
well, no, i don't reside anywhere in particular. i just keep moving.
he was going to take away all my data, equipment --
just this one part, okay?  "i have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember, and i guarantee you will not get one past me"
keep the animal quiet.
now.
looks like it, but--
no.  well, not exactly...it's that...i felt like i wasn't in control.  for the first time since...all that.  i'm scared.
dude. that's my sister.
we're safe here.  i hope.  what do you think?
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: i'm going to murder you, evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
it never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
they got tired of fighting, went to the indian territories for a while. but the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to mexico. crossed at eagle pass.
what?
yeh, better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  boy, kids go wild for that.
back!  back, you savages!  back!
too fast.  too many moving parts.
yeah. i like the cartoons. they make me laugh. they draw the biggest titties.
right! strictly business.
yeah. some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
who is he?
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well --
maybe hawaii.
ok.  ok.
my dad said he found you on the golf course. are you sleepwalking again?
nothing if not vampires...
don't try to charm me, charlie bodell.
paul it's telly. open up.
bic... it's a bic pen.
god, that's so pathetic. i bet she didn't even notice him.
no.
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
what about bill?
yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
what are you going to do?
she just took her hair down.  now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  you better get that ice.
pay attention to women, leon.  they are dangerous, you know?
and clean.
come off it, leo. i'm late for work...
george, i may be wrong, i may be a maniac. but i believe in this, and i'm not going to lose it.  you know how much i want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. i'm sorry, george. i'm staying.
i like it too.  it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. it can be a natural, zesty enterprise. but unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
aye.  said to follow it to the edge of night.  but is this the right bird?
get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
sure, i remember tom from the old days.
sure.
no, why should i? it's yours.
where did the vehicles stop?
right now, if you like.
do tell. i love a good plan.
aw, now, don't you start telling me i shouldn't dunk.
maxwell.
walter...  i don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  you know what i mean?
johnny...
and that's why i think you fit in here.
i should've said renaissance, right? it went over her head.
i like to watch.
from what?
that's what i'm afraid of. "any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
hello.
no.
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you've been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
what do you think i am?
his dead body with a bullet in it.
really?
blow me.
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that? do you dress up leslie?
well you tell him ta take it easy with that. he's gotta learn ta respect women the way connor does.
congratulations, brother.  i've been waiting for you.
thought you'd never ask. biscuit needs some gravy.
could he speak english? emilio couldn't speak english.
coming.  i can't sleep.  i woke up shouting in the middle of the night. geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
why don't we just take these -
maybe he's hungry.
what!? so you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? no way! that's my god damn truck!
you think now that jake's dead, there's all that money there and i don't need you anymore, and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
how do you propose i write it? with dust, upon the air?
very talented son of a bitch. too bad we can't kill him.
what good will that do?
did you ever go to the copa when i was away?
well, you sure picked the right place.  i mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
i wouldn't be seen dead in them. they're dead grotty.
life support check.  elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  you're a woman. i can relate to that.
skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
i don't want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
sure, i'll give you a shot at it, but ganz is mine.  you know, that big indian plays it for keeps...
i'm a werewolf.
i know.  just did what you had to. that banner and stuff, that's just ike.  don't worry about it.
jennifer.
names are incredibly intimate. we barely know each other. trust me on this.
quiet, blender boy. i told you from the beginning, selina, i'm not a very good liar. i am not captain god, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when i find out who is--the man will pay.  my sister died in that museum attack. you can check the atlanta obituaries. i've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. why else would i come to oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
fine.
well, let's see what we get.
we've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. it'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
you tell me, bill.
i don't know... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
you tell buck and i'm involved whether i like it or not...
cow tipping?
i'm glad you like it.
the big boy did...?
this is absurd. besides feldman's an allergist. if you're going to do something, do it right.
what mind?  if i had a mind, i'd never have let you talk me into this.
i don't follow you.
have you ever failed?
thanks. so...  what do you want to do?
mcgill. no, the marriage'll take place as planned.
his wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. the big c.
he's very excited about it.
i... you're not going to understand this.
no you don't, and you know it.
an hour? what's an hour! you know how time flies, walter. my tie? get it.
no, baron!  i beg your pardon.
thank you.
the cops are non-negotiable, ippolito.  why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
well, you know, "the whole thing's theatre..."
well, you had better go and get it from the office. that's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. now chop-fuckin'-chop.
not for long.
you need a ride?
you're right, kid, clemenza is okay. it was paulie.
hold it, mister.
yeah.
maybe luther hopes ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
no -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
cut.
well, i'm just asking. you sound a little –
hey, what am i-your son? whatta you mean? i-i came over to --
i guess so.
no. stay. i want you close to me. this couch is wrong. it's not a "married couch."
you realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it.
have fun at work.
well, i'm sure as hell not what i thought i was gonna be.  i was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  i mean, hell -- i was miss wichita, for god's sakes.  did i tell you that?  you live next door to a real live beauty queen.  i still got the tiara.  i kept it cause i thought it meant something.  i thought it meant i was gonna do something great with my life.  i thought it proved i was gonna grow up to be someone.
now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
you betcha. there ought to be some reward money from mama. say ten thousand bucks worth.
oh. well, wasn't it shakespeare who said: "when strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
i hope he doesn't get out his slides.
describe him.
"magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  when his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
if that's the way you want it.
this is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
could i run a tube through that wall, without harming benes?
aaaahhhh!
sorry, jack.  it’s too important to me.
more like two-two point two million.
--and i can tell you where to get off.
who?
john! you used to fly together!
it's all i could think of.
well, then i'm going to film it.
man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. big goddamn deal.
and what in heaven's name brought you to casablanca?
that's delusional.
crime of passion. he just went nuts. he would have shot everyone in here. he just ran out of bullets.
put me on the hailing frequency.
it's all we got.
it's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
not at all.
i say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
this is totally unnecessary --
walter and i are engaged!
i didn't sleep all night.
i admit it - i was scared! i was shocked, in fact , by what he said. and he's so...convincing. i'm sorry if i let you down, but really, i still say he's just one opinion. i don't even like his books that much. they're all so aggressively confrontational. i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize.
did pop come down?
i will only be gone about half an hour.
i can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. but what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
yeah. oh, boy, yeah... jes', you must be tired.
that's perfect!
<i>that's the crew. they follow us.</i>
fight club was the beginning.  now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- project mayhem.
crooked? i should think you'd be glad to find out i wasn't crooked.
so?
that's mr. beast to you.
no ... i can do this because i've spent my whole career building anti communist credentials.
thank you. now, where were we?
hi there, little brother.
lucy's going on seventeen now...
what the hell are you doing here? i thought you were playing hockey at one.
who knows the secrets of the human heart.
you stole from them, you lied to me.  how do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
are you a man?
confirm, captain. lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into earth orbit...
i'm still here, aren't i?  see this?
just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- and bing-bam-boom i'm away on a tangent -- i get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: because i am what i believe. i am what i teach, i do as i say, i live by these rules as religiously as i preach them: and you wanna know what? i'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
now you know.
if she runs, then it's a cover story. all true.  all accurate.
you're crazy. where's mac?
they'll be able to track it.
well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. lists of people we have to write to. find mama's relatives addresses in italy -- stuff like that.
no!
i cannot believe this.
what was that about?
yeah, i know. what are you looking for?
there are monsters in the gelatin!
okay.
all right, fine.
which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
very fine bone structure.
i think it's fizzled out.
and how do you feel about that?
how bout you?  i'll give you the whole hundred!
how much of this island have you explored?
how am i a hypocrite?
...i, if you'd listen to me. please.  i closed the cocksucker. his ex, john, his ex, i didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
and i'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a new yorker?
exactly correct, sir.
shutup, ted.  you didn't notice shit. keep hammering.
then why did you bring them?
oh, my god!  ouch!  no wonder you quit.
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome.
walt disney, who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  jesus christ plays shuffleboard.
i know everything about your sister. i'll prove it to you.
what did you do with the rest?
it won't work like that.
i think we need to eat.
yeah... yeah... now i can hear it.
caesar, what are you going to do?
is that a crack about our singing...?
he was trying to tell me something.
it happens to this piece of shit...
why didn't you stop at the market?
i'm afraid we may need more than that. there's a bird of prey on the lookout for us. and she can fire while she's cloaked.
ah, hell, let bart take a crack at it.  he'll get into the swing of things or i don't know writers. let's make it a dame, bart, keep it simple. we don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. the important thing is we all have that barton fink feeling, but since you're barton fink i'm assuming you have it in spades.  seriously bart, i like you. we're off to a good start. dammit, if all our writers were like you i wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. i'd like to see something by the end of the week.
stop it! i'm just trying to say i think we should take our friendship to the next level.
what john doe?
-- your intel corroborates what we already know. sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... the heart of his sworn enemy. a recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to sparazza. this and the mention of this mysterious swede makes the million dollar contract on israel very real.
of what?  i'll be unconscious.
well, that's the wrong line for a start.
at the time, i don't know, i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
i got it.  but you can tell her yourself.  just watch your ass and you'll make it.
h'm?
wooden bridge, huh?
wouldn't know what to do with it all --
they're closing the granview. you know, theater down on biscayne?
'cause you're a jag-off. i would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
not bad...? this guy's dr. kildare, the jury's going to love him, mick... and you calm down, all right? their guy, towler's, the author of the book,  'methodology and practice, anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'all these guys are god. i saw them walk on water...'  they had an obstetrical nurse in there. we got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
i have a bond receipt for you to sign.
thass right. just play it...
you said "crash".
but where would we go?
how old are you?
a year ago.  a very nice lady circulated a petition.  she died. last halloween.  answer yes or no.
felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
then this shall be our little secret.  remember that i see into thy soul as god sees.  thou may fool the world. even thy father.  but not me, richard. never me.
got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, mr. reed.  i thought i'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
back home.
uh -- he's from out of town --
i thought we decided you were going to school here.  at u of 0.
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
on the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? i'd really like to know.
if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had. trevor, i never date patients.
yeah, real fine.  especially all the casualties.
and you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
what did you say?
mimi, jorgensen, morelli, tanner..... 
it was all pretty informal.  didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
very well.  mr. chekov, i need pre-approach scan... take the science station, please.
not in that car you're not.
yeah.
data, set a course for that vortex.
but that wasn't johnny's fault.
something smells around here. if you ask me mollie gave her the story on how williams got that gun.  did you smuggle that gun into williams, mollie?
i belong here.
i don't know how to explain it. i'm just too miserable.
now go get molly.  your friends are going to be here any minute.
i know. so am i, right? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service. he's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of southwestern university -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  i think it's only fair to warn you: i'm going to file an action, miles. and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
i want to hear you say it.
thank you.
no bones.
i want serato ..  why can't i have serato?
george, she's not gonna divorce you. you mate for life, remember?
it does, it does if it's the version signed 'i still can't help loving you'.  read that.
sounds like another slime job ... no, they're all right.  they're here now ... right ... let me know.
he had a gun.  he had a gun... and he made it happen.  he made me do it!  he made me put that... that thing on.  oh, christ!  he made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  he had the gun in my mouth.
no, i mean, no one.
yeah?  what happened?
then what?
i... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
you found the leopard!
so.  i guess i've got a wedding to go to.
oh come on cecile. he's crazy about you.
an appetite.  maybe you won't die after all.
yeah.
alright, suit yourself.
is something wrong? what's happened to your face?
no. you can't trust her.
al.
what? now? it's my lunch hour.
it's not me, it's my wife.
very well.
look, i don't want any trouble with you but that's my horse and i mean to have him back.  one way or another.
so?
york just turned up outside.  we're trying to get him into infirmary.
try again.
this is nothing.  it will blow over by tomorrow.
you? the brick?
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies...
-- you've got to leave.
um-hum ...
if you see him.
free!
no. not a bit all right. hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
yeah ?—how do i know?  i gotta good mind to plug you.  i shouldn't take any chances on you.
what?
not yet.
with gestures, of course.
yes. i think it'll look better.
she's a local. when the dudes come out to new mexico, they went to wallow in latin glamour. this is a bad town for blondes.
is it still dripping?
eight, six, and four.
there may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
pussy love pink rocks.
oh yeah.
a -- a tourist.
me? never.  never.
a thousand times. he caught an uncatchable fish.
i wish i knew. uhura?
you're right, you're right, superman. there were wrinkles to iron out. but, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the xk 101.
sir, i was, as instructed, waiting for the arrival of the strike force. {pause)
so -- he says i'm nice.  he's a nice boy, too, miss connell, a very nice boy.  but i'm worried about his drinking.
the human?
couldn't make the last edition. it'd take me four hours to translate your story into english.
168  continued:
the hulmes will look after me. they want me to live with them!
uh brock, today you are without me...
please. let them stay 'til morning. the militia will not come here, they know you are a hutu with influence.
i was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was o.k. by me.  i introduced him to people--even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. it didn't seem to matter--i didn't care--  --until he roped ned in. some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
but...it's just a house i've dreamed about.  i dream about it all the time.  thank you for what you did last night.
we unraveled in the face of the enemy!
i think not.  after you...
is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
were there any calls?
pull in! get the others.
those guys tried to kill me tonight. they were aiming right at me.
the enemy is matching velocity.
oh. i guess i always liked rusty better.  could you give me a ride to school?
then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
that fool woman took it.  you be careful around her, jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
i took too long.
you must have a bible in here, don't cha?
why?
who? how would i know him?
what was i gonna do, call dad?  i don't even know his number.
i've got a <u>name</u>.  it's <u>z</u>.
we have to pull him. he's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the u.n. zorin will eat him alive.
i don't follow your logic. what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell's money?
there you go.
yes.
what?
oh no, no.  you're not bothering him.  he has lots of time since he's been retired.
you got to relax, henry. since the deluge started, you been working in the or and running the outfit, too.
i'm in mourning.
that makes mom the czarina.  i'm a czarette.  like anastasia.
no.
no! he's not dead! he's still breathing! look!
if they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. how can we rely on them?
apology accepted.
oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. amado is into this big tejano roots thing and i've never been further than ciudad leon--
harry york. i work for martoni kaminski, he's running for congress here.
oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, i can think of two reasons.
there was an enormous neutron energy surge.
oh, i'm taking you...quite seriously.
i can recover. hold on!
then i guess we're even.
take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
we've lost enough agents for one night.
we called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
so you...
well leave then. go to hell.
wrong! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california... there's a big difference.
did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
yeah.  i practically forgot.  but after you busted that thing, i got to thinking, "jesus--maybe i'll start the violin again." that didn't just belong to woodly.  that belonged to everybody.  maybe he would have sold it to me, and i could have some fun.  after you busted the violin, boy, and penelope walked out, i thought to myself, "jesus--who could blame her?"
why what?
only god knows the meaning of such words, my son.
don't be silly. nothing you can do. must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
what has artie to do with it.
they're in the basement.
okay...
it has been alleged - yes—
touchy. look everybody, it's casper, the friendly crimefighter...
yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, i was wondering when you'd get around to libbets.
i hope that's the cousin.
i need you to get me paula --
did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
hey, if violet was helping me relax, i'd probably do the same thing.
jesus christ, diego, where are you? it's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
looks good outside.
did you do that when you were a kid?
i am busy inside.
i was at lena's last night. you were terrific.
from the chronicle building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
i never join nothin'.
i'm sorry because i was looking forward to that, but i' m going back in a few hours.
yes
yep.
oui.
riker here.
oh.
or you will do what, mrs. marshall?  but i admire your courage. your husband, on the other hand...
oh, sure.
it is?
finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?
two days.  an hour or so.
that's rough, man.  if i don't get steamed dumplings once a week, i go crazy.
what i've seen... i've liked.
no, i mean your past. about why you were in here.  i'll take you first thing in the mornin'. you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? i just can't let you stay here. it's the rules. if something happened well, i'd be liable.
i can't accuse him just dry long 80.
what is wrong with old habits, mr. overstreet?
special needs class.
only as a last resort.  what are the councils doing now?
...and buried him.
i'm just kidding.
you want a pint, go to the pub.
listen. listen, longfellow. you've got brains, kid. you'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. don't talk to anybody! these newshounds are out gunning for you.
yeah, an' i could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
barks his agreement.
i'm all right, mr. leland.  only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  i learned 'em! didn't i, officer?
yeah, of course they let me out. chickenshits. i gotta pay some class c misdemeanor ticket. so did i call it or did i call it? she spent the night, didn't she? hm? oh, that sucks for you, pal. oh, shit.
i'll see you at mass tomorrow. we'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
i wanted to save geordi. i tried. but i experienced something i did not expect.  i believe it was fear.
so talk...
what's the matter with you?
yes, this is not life, will. this is a stolen season.
do i look gay to you? relax.
you try calling the police?
i'm just asking, what if?
thank you, sir.  i'm see threepio, human cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, artoo detoo.
chi-chi!  chi-chi!
-- he accessed the account --
think a soul could get lost there? with all those pilgrim-types?
but bela lugosi's in it!
fella named beaumont. they have him up at county. it started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
i recognize you only as my son, no more.
forensics people are sure of it. you have any idea who might have put him there?
when you fall asleep tonight, i'm gonna fart in your face.
what's happenin' here?
greater than treasure, usul.  we have thousands of such caches.  only a few of us know them all.  when we have enough... we shall change the face of arrakis. listen!...
yes no not really.
devereux. my brother cole dated a european girl once.
oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
in the next two minutes?
yes.
huh?
i've been looking for this jake vig for some time now. problem is, the guy's the invisible man. a spook, a spectre, a ghost. then, like a gift, jake's good buddy and member of his crew, alfonse moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
then what are you doing here?
i don't. and i'm not going to try.
really?  that's sudden.
at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. well of course, he's losing.
mm-mm.
thursday? that's the untouchables -- with bob stack.
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
i'm sorry...?
i seen 'em b'fore you did.
what the fuck are you doing here?
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. you lied. it was obvious.
you're going to look for him -- now?
...and i thought i'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
none of that, lady.
take 'em! i want his head!
where are the guards?
any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
exact patterns. the energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. but why?
what does that mean?
what happened, mike.
read me what she said.
is he the only one?
the title?
carrying them. they could all be carrying them for what we know.
they're not going to--
and i was wondering.
the gun will be there.
can i trouble you for one of those magazines?
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
oh, see, i meant someone you've had sex with. that's part of the theory.
sure.  they want me back in so i won't break in!  they <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
no! no, thank you!
if you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, best.
motherfucker works fast.
yes?
just go around him.
must i hear this?
oh, she's doing just fine, reverend mother -
i know i am.  i know!
you want a confession? why don't you confess, bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
power. there hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. most of the batteries are depleted.
sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  kaufman, people are sick of you.  the wrestling... the hoaxes...
that's reassuring.
i drink.
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "unique." that's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
something like that.  that doesn't surprise you?
you have my absolute assurance, your majesty, that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st. petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
what?!
duroc, i have a bill here for 600,000 francs from tirot, for building the imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  the amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
yes, i'm leaving now -- goodbye.
hey, i thought...
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
this was a beauty.  right, calo?
--and damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
why?
hell, no! i just got something in my eye.
i can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
yeah. all twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
you tell me.
nothing...al. why do you talk   that way?
&lt;&lt;are you sure?&gt;&gt;
simulates?
oh, i think we're going to have several.
that wouldn't be too good, would it?
it's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, honey. i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. i don't believe he'll ever do it again.
what will become of me then?
did you find out about her parents?
she cannot possibly refuse.  her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
aha.
norma, are you alright?
of course not!
twenty-five this time.
you're tense, darling. you could use a long, slow screw.
actually, i was always partial to roy rogers.  i really dug those sequined shirts.
steamed dumplings?
i'm the one who wanted to study it....
it gave me a little chance, and i took it. they won't get me back. i'm going to live, and you're going to help me. yes?
and if you ditch us we get zilch.
why?
what are you doing here?
right after we played backgammon.
no. dotty's the last.
why backdrafts. whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  give him another chance.
are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
but you knew that i'd -- die.
like ahh... i don't know...  five thousand dollars.
you have to ask like that?
didn't mean nothin'.
dick-weed!
what?
hmmph. hmmph.  nathan, we have to talk, you and i.
let's see.  where's it from?
paul.  i thought we agreed.  no press.
eight and two thirds.
jesus!
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
20 minutes?
still, i think you'd upset people and i'm not sure that's right.
well...my home "sector" was called paramus ...
other guy?
we've done this before, so many times.  the last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
and how did he do that?
nobody knows she's here. i called her personally. nobody knows.
no. no, you don't.
well, you know where it is.
duncan, you are absolutely gallant. if cora doesn't marry you, i shall.
because -- i am.
yeah.
chills, fevers, sweats.  you can describe it and name it after yourself: "the woodly galloping crud."
what... ?
sure, hon.
squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do i know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...i'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of hercules...fast?
he'd want to know about all this.
i've loved you ever since i can remember, long before you married tom dickson.
i need... to talk to you.
i would like to put shu's alleged crime in a context, your honor. and we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... if it please the court, i'd like to call mr. reynard.
you'd drifted right through the core systems.  it's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
dotty -- this is not "guy.". this is a "syndrome."  it's called early midlife, about-to-marry, hanging onto the-bottom-rung dear- god-don't-let-me-be-alone, i'll- call-my-newly long-suffering- assistant-without medical-for- company syndrome.  and if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
rational?!  love is not rational! are you crazy?
but deliver us from the evil one.
uh, i'll try...
tom, i jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. without him i jus' don't wanta live.
they didn't get my contracts.
i got a file on him two inches thick.  he's a petty fraudster. this is something else.  ever heard of someone called the puritan?
typical male.
i have no intension of being nasty, mr. mitchell.
i never make bets or guesses, that way i'm never wrong and i never have to pay out.
i've always thought that myself.
but i love you. and i want the whole world to know it.
yes - one please.
no...it's nothing to do with you. it's just that i was scared of coming back. now, after all these years, i thought i was strong, that i had forgotten lots of things. instead, i find it's quite the opposite, as if i had never left. and yet, i look at lia and feel as if i didn't know her, and you, mamma...i abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
which...
can't move.
where are they?
i love you.
c'mon, don't lie.
you mean for good?
no... it was a seven letter word.
aw, come on, bill.  it's just business.
that has nothing to do with it. we've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
what?
if i say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
the white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  that's why they wear them.
it's all so complicated.
easy night. bachelor party. can we give wendy a ride?
are they?
i'm sorry.
i got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
it’s okay. the cops did it.
which one?
do i know you? you look familiar.
no.
thank you for seeing me.
probably.  sarah, if i get zeroed...
such a sordid state of affair.
well...no.
i have feelings for you.
hmmm.
how do you mean?
i know you wouldn't need leon if heidi was treating you right.  the thing i don't understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway?  you got two kids on welfare now.  what're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
sapphire!
we used to, every summer.
"your movie" -- i am so sick of that! it's your movie -- but it's his life! did you ever think about that?! did you ever think about that old man and marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
me too.
she is a true psychic.  she sees beyond the relativity of time.  for her there is no past, present or future.  there is only what is.
sure.
but max, she needs me.  it could mean life or death.
what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  jesus, it's right there in front of you. i know what a goddamn shark looks like, i've been through it, don't you understand?  i've seen this sonofabitch before!
but how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
this isn't any better, chris.
leave me be! why are you doing this? why are you picking at my sores... what is it that you want?... you want what? what's with you? i hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose.  what is it, mom? no kidding.
oh, right. yeah, that's true. he used to rub all kinds of things on it. paprika. ground lamb.
in spirit only, i'm afraid.
he needs to be in a safe place.  have you heard from mr. garindi?
isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? and all else may grow in time...?
as long as they can use you?
listen, vanessa, whatever happens, i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl. i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, i don't know what happened. the whole time i was shagging her-- i mean really shagging her, i mean it was crazy, i was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, in and out!--
no-what, what...? i... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
i'm sorry. it is.
okay, everyone.
that won't be necessary.  sooner or later i knew you'd crack this thing, max.  you got me.
yeah, i'm sorry, i was just looking for the principal's office.
thanks, but i'll manage.
we too are brothers, macleod.  in fact, you have more family than you think.
they'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
thanks.  but either way it still feels...
right.
my...my neck.  my...my neck.  perfect?  oh -- bang on my chest if you think i'm perfect.  go ahead -- bang on it!
i promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! when he helped us! loverboy don't want to play!
don't fret, benjie, it's --
that's not us.
come an' see.
what do you mean?
yes sir, i guess that's true smallest room in the house.
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
ok.
then you shouldn't even be around it. you know, it's ...
i think it's more complicated than that. besides, he's a little... scattered. he almost... did something stupid tonight. at least, i think so. anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
she could be the most charming woman you ever saw. people loved to be around her.
s'alright. i'm sorry too. shit, i gotta take a leak... pull over at that gas station.
give me that gun.
oh, i don't remember that...
quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and bill. more people might --
seventy-one?  what's seventy-one?
you put up a great fight, lion.
me neither. who was the boy she was talking about, eugene?
we done?
i'm supposed to be in tahoe.
who you calling dumb, dickless?
what're you - a mindreader...?  who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
if you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
i'm surprised he bothered with it.
what do you want me to do?
that's what i mean... always looked like you was just knocked out in love... was real nice to see.
abe lincoln...
