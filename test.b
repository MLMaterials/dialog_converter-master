well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? i gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
consuelo screamed too -- and clo clo. why did you do it? why? quick. tell me why?
two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.

i can't sit on this balcony forever. i'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
in this barracks?
i need you for an assignment the chief's given me the go-ahead on. a duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  you'll be working out of homicide.

i really don't know. i don't live there. i was just visiting...a grave.
it's jungle rot!  this room is making everybody sick!  this is your family doctor speaking now.  here--i brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
that's exactly what he says about you.
yeah.  happening, isn't it?

maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india. very rare.
hi.
when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in birchin lane, london.  i requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as messrs. sharp and salomon had been treated here.
pull over.
oh jesus christ.
well, maybe you better look again.
it's me.
thank you, karen.
inventin' jokes ain't easy.
what?  what's wrong?
you're wasting your time, lady. nothing's off the record with me.

what happened to that guy from kentucky?
...<u>please</u>...
like riding a bike.
i don't believe it. the marquis de sade? you're actually publishing his novels?

i got my mase.

he's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
the same year that sparazza murdered agent freeman heller...
bye, house.
right! just between as and the security forces.
rowan...   think of what's in that book.  think of last night!
no.  i didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  instead... i was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  i couldn't bear it.  i broke off my meditation.  i couldn't go on. there was something... pulling me back.
know what?
give me the bad news.
thirty-two dollars.
come on. let me buy you something to eat. looks like you could use the company.
of what? they're both crooks.
well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
we need to get past them.
andy, you don't want this.
why should i be?
check it out!
seems like i'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
i asked around.
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
claire...
yeah, well i kinda figured that.
you're getting too cool for me, j.d. i don't know how to talk to you.
then we should have had lunch at the bank.
what did it look like?
sloan never told us she had friends like you.
then let's begin.
cover me.
i'm sorry i ruined everything. if i wasn't here you could go out.
no.
yeah. he delivers the goods on zammito. if we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the van gogh and the other paintings are.
i said -- not exactly -- no.
wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at mrs. farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
me?  i say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
no.
but you don't think that's a solution.
there's a bomb shelter over in durant, by the iga, on first. you all know where that is?
yes.  come out, i know you're in there
well, you tell her majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  what the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
that's government property, major.
what about basil? where's my snake?
you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
are you going to kill us?
yes, i did, just now. don't you remember?
jesus, how could you be so stupid?  come on, we're going to a hospital.
fire, mr. scott!
no.
i want you and tommy to stay with my mother.
so?
no?
i doubt it. she's just an...
long ago -- before my father's father.
well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
i think so.
hey, you're eddie felson, aren't you?
no, no, no. no exploitation. this is serious…but don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
really.
then what's the gun for! what's this for?
no shit.
oh.  bigfoot gets his out of a can.
i was just beginning to wonder. aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
where's my information?
i can sit up straight.  i just can't..sit up straight very well.  it's not important!  i saw who shot me.  ethan, i saw the mole.  it was kittridge.  <i>kittridge!</i>
the cusp of my life.  what i was, what i am, what i will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. opening the box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  which makes the ocean... uncrossable.

that's the air force base.
preacher! go on down and get me some bourbon. j. t. s. brown. no ice, no glass.
we... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
okay.
this all has something to do with superman, doesn't it?
when was that?
short pieces, huh? you should try to write songs.
mom!
well, i'd like to travel. and maybe go back to school, but i really don't know...i'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but i'm so... i don't know...unsure.
sneaking around with your brother?
the name van tassel is blackened.  you share that name.
always good advice.
i don't know.
like a mafucka.
you do.
we can't all be perfect, saavik. you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. around you are humans, and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you. tolerance is logical.
no.  her case is too advanced.  but maybe, someday, with more research-
perfect.
the one with the horses.
why don't you shut up, professor? just relax.
say what, walt spoon!
you better not mess with me, rhodes. i'd love to serve your balls to those red coats for lunch! think about it!
we don't need him.
getting pearl to bed. i --
mary beth, i hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
oh, anything you say, paul.
oh, is he dead?

i am not! i'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
everybody hold on tight.  we're gonna send this sucker into oblivion!
really.
i'm with you on that. and don't you think it needs a good female part? increase the romance angle.
i just fnished work. i counted the bags.
well, what then, sergeant?
actually, i'm a movie star out for a walk.
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
no!... i'm fine. thank you.
lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. it's like you come from two different worlds.
i'm going to run back to walter's arms, if he's still have me.
what are those mirrors for?
no. you took them out.						  *
where -- ?
this portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. for the love of god.
michael, you're sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family.
... i feel like something's been spoiled now.
i have a tent to myself.
there's a manhole at canal and bowery.
and the child who did die?
we're escaping!
you're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
the party's over.
hey. you noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
fine, then let's get started. the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and i would like to know if you agree with the president's view of the economy?
abby... you all right?
i'll keep it in my office room.
no.
yes.
it's a standard gui. once i've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
well, you should.
poor freud, turning in his grave.
one cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--douglas points. one medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
who gave you this idea? what is responsible for all this?
sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
you mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!
i'll tell you what, if i'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, i'll let you know and we'll split the money.
i called mommy.
he looked too shaken-up.
a virgin brain!  well we're going to start you off right.  so what do you know about this?  save us some time...
i... i love everybody, man.  i love my wife.  my kids.  little tyson. my new baby kaydee.  my brother tee pee. i love my friends, my teammates, who am i leaving out?
what do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
do you wanna to go to memphis and get married?
well... send my love, if you see him again.
you may step down.
--yes you are, sean. you resent me. and i'm not going to apologize for any success that i've had.
what the hell's wrong?  i didn't do anything.
you must have quite some harem.
am i a cursed woman, doctor? must i be betrayed by every man i meet --
not if you chose to stay within god's channel...
you know the beef. this new rule of yours, that we work alone. we're taking it up with the super.
there's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  i've already been workin' on a young fellow from chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to biarritz for a good time. likes a little game of bridge and poker.
i love you, adam.
oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
yes, sir, that's exactly who i am, sir... and what i am... a victim, sir. mr. alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
i shivved him.
it was my fault.
oh man, bucky.
then come for dinner.
heel argo!  hobbes!  heel!
ah yes.  farley flavors.  you know, i find it...
good morning, sir.  are you general bonaparte?
no?
i'll tell you what, mr. martins. on wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...i thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
i feel like... we can do anything.
drop it or i'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
the name of my user, yeah. but how... ?
oh shit!
my father was a sick man.
not yet, i'm afraid.
come on, cartman. it's not your fault.
move? you're alive. if you want, i can fly.
maybe a minute. she came right out.
i just did.
yeah.
someone's trying to destroy my life, and i'd like to find out who.
well, then he's the man i want to see.  will you come along?
you wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  it's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  i won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  i only took their sins to logical conclusions.
is newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
i'm willing to take a cut in pay.
why me?
chase, it's dylan!
i don't know. i don't know anything. except phil says they got him. and he's in jail.
with you clowns watching my back? what do you think?
you could almost pass for a detective, d'amour.  i work for the best illusionist in the world.
july fourth weekend. storm season starts today. the clouds roll in like clockwork.
none.  this was arranged.
well, i'm a little muddled.  the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east.  and there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
yes, sam's tough alright.
can i do something for you still? you're not too rich, or too famous that i can't help you?
yeah. that's right, too.
but all this did i know before. what says he of our marriage? what of that?
i need some time, david.  a little time.  it's not just you.  it's partly me.
how can you possibly?  i've got to get right on the plane.  i'm leaving now.
is that a baby?
i mean really, deeply angry...
yes i can...
bullshit!  you don't need me!  you've never needed me!  i can't help you! understand?!  i have to get out.
elizabeth goes free!
no. the owners are in australia.
yeah. i think so. i just had to tell him some of what i knew. is friday still on?
there is, but it's not that interesting.
i don't know about you, but i feed off my emotions.
goodness, that's awkward.
you wrote his scripts for him?
that's africa. there's an african in all of us, isn't there?
i'm not sure.  we have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
you have our cards.
i don't think so.
she's mine!
i wrote a poem too.
i'm just making a point.  you have no idea what you're asking.  how much trust two people need to do something like this.
fifteen.
you hafta go home. there's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
orthopedics?
yes. i am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
she just needs time to cool off i'll give it a day.

i got fired this morning... where else am i gonna take it?
but why would andy want me?
i want my fucking money.  i'm getting out of here.  i don't want anything more to do with you.
yeah, well, what can i say?  dad must've had forty pounds on me. jesus, you remember him being this big?
that's the magic number.
they always let felons sit in on honors biology?
'taken.'  that's nice.  when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor, transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them.
that bad huh?
this is business.  there was an accident in maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
is he coming back here?
you saw it?
she told me not to talk to you.
stop -- singing!!!
hi.
you're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  that doesn't happen.  these men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  the method itself is part of the pleasure...
yes. i did. willfully and repeatedly.
i decided not to - i'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
you're kiddin' me.
see, it's not a macho thing. it's about equilibrium in your inner ear. you could've used a patch, but it's too late now. get used to it.  some folks just can't sail.
people who will help our cause.
hmm?  see them?
hello, my name is john merrick. i am very pleased to meet you!
what?
no loyalty.
i can't.
are you kidding me? he's not psychotic!
okay, boy, beat it.
an outbreak of <i>chimera.</i>
ah, i got a date tonight with that mary girl i told you about.
what the fuck do you know about my people?
well i got the tires rotated, i went shopping, and i made dinner.
man, i hate work even when somebody else does it!
all right.
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
she's having a baby. twins.
delayed shock. or maybe not. i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... just not sure if i want to.
i'll go, but i want my money right now!
doesn't register.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew i'd be here... and gives a performance! out of nowhere - gives a performance!
he's not going tonight.
what baby?
next week "east lynne."
any time it's saturday and i don't hafta do any work, i'm doin' okay!
it is not that i care for <u>you</u>--but that i posses an enquiring mind.  what will you <u>do</u> when i am gone?  when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
you're conning me, sweetheart. i ain't responsible for no baby.
i'll be here.
i'm sorry.  i didn't do it!  can i still have my dog?
are you losing money?
i am. dinner with brock leviathan...
are they paying you for all this?
stop talking like that, you white mouse!  nothing's going to go wrong. as a matter of fact, today i have taken steps to insure total disaster. at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris.
that's exactly what this place is. one great big coffin.  let's stake 'em.
umm, ummmmm
weird.  got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
fourteen.  we seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  that's why you didn't find it in your computer.
that vase.
if you're b.l. willard, 4th recon group, we'd like you to come with us.
as a plumber?!
i'm in charge. i went back very soon after the accident. they didn't expect me for a couple of months. i'll just take that time now... i can still oversee things from montana... take my fax... my computer...
somebody has to pay for that error. and it's not me.
it's for your finger.
amen
there's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
several, i think.  there is not much to tell.  i'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
pour it in your ear.
do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
the quicker the better. well -- i finally got out what i came in to tell you.  so long, walter, and better luck next time.
swap them? for what?
i'd appreciate that.
better dead.
i don't know, helen. i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. leave the t.v. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off.
i thought as much.
is the food alright? maria tells me that you didn't eat.
i know - and a war broke out right over your head.
look at his face, he did the deed.
we're not animals, but don't force us to be.  walk over.
you shut your face --
mister señor love daddy, i'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, tina.
well, i guess i've told you almost everything there is to tell. my folks live in a small town near hartford. i'm down here alone trying to make a living.  oh, i'm really just a nobody.
-humidity, i know.  highest lead density on the market.
i stopped drinking.  i gave up drugs.  and i'm meditating three hours a day.  it's the center of my life...
and you wouldn't be.

junior kim was doa at the hospital.

you know what i really like?

aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
land! are you crazy? i'm no amishman and i'm no farmer! i'm a cop. that's what i know and that's what i do!
oh yeah.  violet!
what's the line on visitation?
i'm sorry? what are you oozing about?
do peter sellers again.
still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
strike out, eh?
i want to get in.
don't get pissed at me, just 'cause i want to be ready when this war starts.
i think he's lying to us. i could see it in his eyes.
no.
they were familiar when i painted them.  that one's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  and that's a rembrandt.
oh, not much.  gates just had his tonsils taken out.  the hard way.
you rigged it...you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
my father always degraded me.  killed my self-esteem.  and my mother was blind.
that's funny.
maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
mr. cyr!
oh i him.
fine, i guess. except right now i'm going through this where i don't want him to touch me.
thanks.
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  i can show you on a map.
oops--my face must match my cape. and to think we were going to let you go...
plan c...  ...is me.
did he?
"leo.  the stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
they tell me you use narcotics. could i bring someone around to look at your arms?
oh yes... they found our knowledge useful for a time.  they used us much as your people did.  then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
what makes you think she likes me?
family.
it's hard to say. doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. all it was was appendix.
what do you have, a fucking water pistol?  get him back!
he got him.  he always does.  eventually.
what are you talking about?
i called and called but you were out.  i thought i'd be gone before you got back.
sure, dad.
helen and i went out for breakfast. excom's not supposed to convene til eight.
why?
what do you know about him?
what weapons do you have?
it's what i've learned.
how did you find me?
you certainly do.
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can't go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?
ashley. we're not going anywhere i used to work.
and i'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "two corned beef sandwiches." when you want two ginger ales, say, "two ginger ales."
what? now? it's my lunch hour.
i said, "everyone's going to die, jimmy. but drew's not going to die of aids. there's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
no, they're living in nice now.
me? nowhere. i was asleep.
i'll work on it, ma'am.
they told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... in other words, things of that sort.
i didn't say.
that's right.
i don't need a geography lesson, luthor.
how will i do this one?...
yeah, typically. that's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
look, i don't know what this...
oh no!  did he get hurt?

you're going to three-four avenue c, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
like you?
walk away, jack.
i'm sorry. oh god, i'm sorry. i'm some kind of monster. i'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
don't worry, mr. dickson. we'll find out whether he's telling the truth. i'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
okay, great, grunick -- easy shots now -- huh?  good night.
i'll talk to them.
dig the pit, i don't know.
no.
i have a vague idea.
who are they, sir?
david... sorry i'm late.
who the hell is this "they?"
what is it?
maybe i should reconsider my...
ready!
you had to kill heller?!
but kara, no one has ever gone from here to earth. the journey is dangerous.
whatcha predicting -- your boy goldwater going to split the party?
what for?
i'm going to leave now.
no. that's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. you don't even know who you are. you're nothing. less than nothing. a zero. who are you?
"insane?" the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. the event horizon could be there in a day...
jesus, frances, how'd you find me?
you used his credit card.
yeah, i guess so.
no, not until after they killed him.
i don't want to... i swear...
i met one of them.
ring?
it's all right. i really do know them.
who knows you have these?
someplace where no one knows her.  someplace strange and new.
and then they'll kill 'em.
but why ?
feel like talking to us. answering a few questions?
it's not too late to show her you're sorry.
right.
what?
the corruther's house. that's where jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
next week's episode.
just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, i guess.
you can't?
kenny's aunt?
either do you.
i promise.
now.
you know it is.
and if you can't do that, you sleep.
i say we keep sittin' on boca.
mr. president--
you don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
soprano or alto?
now that's cool.
come on.  let's get back to the others.  we can't leave them alone.
get out of there now!
...anything else?
it is over.
six years.
ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, mr. asbestos...
intensely.
what's your malfunction, rico ?
vegetables.
yes?
burnett?  they want 22% of the value on loads they run into south florida.  it's the juarez cartel model. they guarantee the loads.  the upside is our risk goes to zero. that frees-up capital.
i can't sleep nights.
you're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran.
...you see, i can watch things up here, doolittle. i love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
alright!
okay. bye.
that's the reason?
all right.  but let's keep the price down.  i've called ed concannon.  he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
well, i was in be- it's three o'clock in the morning. you, uh, you got me outta bed, i ran over here, i couldn't get a taxi cab. you said it was an emergency, and i didn't ge- i ran up the stairs. hell - i was a lot more attractive when the evening began. look, uh, tell- whatta you- are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? is that possible?
you're scaring me. i think we should just go.
i warned you, dignan.
well get along with this one.  go ahead of us.  don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
don't be sorry, neither does dad. wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
hey, man, i'm not--
well... thank you. but... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
just a minute, john...okay?  don't go away.
i like the diminished risk.  it frees up capital reserves.  i like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  you can predict their behavior....
i've got a job.
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
no.
i care about what happened. the truth. i'm a student of history, remember?
oh, and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  an architect.
when was the last time you heard me sneeze?
look, why do you care, huh?
mack, this is sheriff dylan.
give me it.
warren!
what you talking?
he's mine?
listen, viktor, i have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  this is business.
not to worry. so... see you tonight, right? right?
you mean like an ape?
i'd like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything, mr. hayes.
quite, absolutely - i always thought they were false.
yeah.
"beg to differ?!"  hey, i'm talkin' about my duplex in burbank!
i'm sorry... i don't know how to ask the questions.
--thank you for calling--
i thought you didn't recognize me.
right before his un-american thing.
sam the bookie?  nothing doing!  you're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
thank you.
no, it's not right.
all i can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  fight it. and if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...i think we can beat it.
goodbye, ted.  i don't want to hurt you.
okay, joe. listen—you know i've always liked you. anytime i could do you a great turn—anytime i ran into a story that looked good—i always came running to you, didn't i? well, i got one now. those wires i sent you were on the level. it's the biggest scoop of the year. i'm giving it to you, joe.
i can't
andy! no!
why? you were so pleased with him.
and what do you expect? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills.  the phone company shows no unusual --
her name's libbets.
who is she? where does she live?
let's see. those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
any particular kind?
yup.
oh, don't be too discouraged. for aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
but your man isn't quite a god!
what is.
i'm glad bill's back.
{baffled) i don't follow you.
right, mr. arkady. and that's not the half of it. i got your money, and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
kill him! finish it!
i know, i know...
i haven't been keeping myself at all.  not lately.
don't never write nothing down. file it up here, like i do.  'cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. ya dig?
they're in 7d.
don't worry.  you'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  we can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
oh.  sorry.  i'm on my way to the ring and --
just mopping up. nine bodies in all.
what?... oh baby...
that's 'cause he's dead.
absolutely. long as she can keep it. isn't that right, james...
i stand corrected mr. decker.  navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
what, they beat you with a rubber bat?
no kidding. buddy-boy and kubelik having themselves a little toot!
this is my doing. this is my arrogance... my vanity...
but julie's a nice girl, and i've seen you work.  she deserves a fighting chance!
i know the feel of the world.  i know how this wood will sound when i knock.  i know how this glass will feel when i pick it up.  certainties. you think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. i can remember so much.  i know the feel of the world,  and i know her.
i need its matrix coordinates, dixie. i've got to nail that thing where it lives.
and there she is --
sure.
just the same, i want one.
listen, dammit.
well, you don't wanna trust me too much. we'll take ned his share together so you don't figure i run off with it.
you found him.
no. you're very well-protected.  no one can find our where you are.
heat's murder.
but i don't want to be miniaturized -- !
what, what?
the penny drops.  <u>you</u> are <u>not</u> job.  yes, job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications. and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  job is not playful.  so you're something of a paradox.
huh?  oh, come on, sis.  i'm tellin' ya, we can't play clue with just two people.
oh just my wolf paraphernalia. some people collect beanie babies... i collect silver bullets.
alright. she told him to meet us here. fuck.
what are you talking about?
oh.  what do you think about?
in other words, scurvy.
no. every time i wake up somewhere different. sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge.
well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
i'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
not on the landscape. we're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
i don't think so...
they'll mend.
she and mollie were talking.
are you sad, bill?
no kidding, hildy.  say, this isn't a rib?
hey! you don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
you're a good man.
that makes a change.
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign. autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films.
but maybe it's not what you think.
where are you taking me?
you are much more.
i sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. i ushered you into this world.  i alone know your true calling, your true name.
yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  and my father blamed me for her blindness...
it's that they don't throw their garbage away. they make it into television shows.
that's not it. that ship was built to go faster than light... that's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
really?
absolutely! i was there twice last year. which building is yours?
don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
yes?
they're already dead.  they can't feel a thing.
keep saying what?
it was wade's old partner... gallagher. he was behind it all.
near alexandria. it isn't in alexandria, it is outside it.
oh, what? you're going to take the professor's side on this?
yeah. i'm thinking about micheal's franco harris fixation. you know how micheal was always harping "immaculate reception?" i've seen that play. a lot of times...and i have to say this... franco was lucky. flat out, right place, right time. that's it. he was where the ball bounced. you get me?
what do you got on korda?
i've seen the way he looks at you. he's always wanted you.  maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
that would be good.
sounds good.
who gets killed?
thank you, steed.
no, for you! how old are you, billy?
really?  you've never been inside?
i -
i almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
i don't know why people say this country's civilised. it isn't. it's fucking primitive.
aw julie, it's my job. it's like being a doctor.
i'll be alright. hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
dude, what the hell is going on?
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists. i'm so sorry i struck you, mrs. peel. please forgive me. i thought you were someone else ...
it happens to me all the time.
with paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. but amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. had a hard time learning to read. me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
you'll tell me some of the things i want to know, won't you?  you'll tell me who runs this place. and why we were kidnapped. and what they're going to do with us!
he knows where she lives?
well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
hey, we fucked once, honey. that hardly makes you a good judge of character. and don't think i didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
does luke know?
no. to thoroughbreds.
it was the bars, then.
there's not going to be a debate. you must leave.
i'll kill 'em. anybody bothers you, i'll kill 'em!
remember, gus. a machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. you've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
and diego?
come on, dude. the other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. i know the drill, i'll wear a rubber --
i'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. keep both feet on the floor. we'll be moving ninety and over.
come on--we're taking off.
fine, we're fine in the circumstances. but i can guess what you've called about. there's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
who is this person that you've found?
i know, but sometimes...
yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. it only works if you're on good terms.
it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins, lotta outs.  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  i'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  it's just--
you find it distasteful, don't you?
in that case --
about seventeen days.
sorry, i didn't think we were making that much noise.
ricky. my little boy. at least here we've got a house. and i've got a job. okay, i'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  i even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
sure. big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
he only bit women so far, right?
fallout shelter.
shit! it's both of them. the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro. but they've moved on- -they're getting closer to sidney. they're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill. they're looking for the new tatum.
that's ridiculous. i've been coming here for years. listen to me. i'm going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
you mean, i don't like it, he doesn't pay?
you might do that.  get me a ticket for...  no, you don't!
ohh!  ohh!  ohh!
yes.
what did you do to end up here?
homework. it's more interesting.
it's dave wilkie! i'm dave wilkie, don't you remember me?
a bad mother. by any standards. i've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.
hello, lisa. i'm trent. what a lovely makeup job.
the door, frank, the door! where you from anyhow, alaska?
there was a slight complication. dr. chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. nothing to worry about. he's promised me i'll have these bandages off in a ...
my children. and richard didn't like my working.
this is lena.
no.
you must, darling.
hey, you put me here.  i just do what i'm told.
go, go, go!
good old razinin! is he still alive? how does he manage?
oh no, no.  you're not bothering him.  he has lots of time since he's been retired.
leave me, just leave me alone josh.
too late --
don't worry about it, man.  get the phone.
yes, there is. an infallible way! they won!
not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
is he looking at us?
no--
hmm.  well, we were in a handicapped spot.  it, uh, it was probably towed.
if we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
so do i.  sort of.
i'm frightened and confused and i... i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
i will -- i assure you that -- you got a fifty on that h-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- i'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
women? women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
what is it?
no. not very big.
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  right over my head. oh, my word! i tell you, those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
and why is that?
trust me. you asked me for help. let me help. trust me.
good idea.
we've come a long way since world war ii, major.  and the lessons we've learned are all in plan-r.
it buys things, just like any other kind.
i changed it.  see you later, mr. travis.  that guy has a problem... maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
do you think i need a haircut?
then we'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine. what does his father do again? steelworker?  doesn't matter, i'm sure justice will be served. in any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. he's quite protective.
this is no time to be choosy, honey.  what do you say we debate this later?  there's still a chance i can get you out of here.
no good... it's eaten too much of me...
a no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. has that never occurred to you?
i know, but...
there a story in that building?
surprised?
we're both in it, harry.
stone mutha.
the game, graham.  the series?
i want to keep my teeth.
'fish'?
they're good, norm, but you're better'n them.
check.
who knows.  plato?
beats me. he just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  what did you do to piss him off?
during my meditation training... i came to a place of deep silence... i was surrounded by light... time and space disappeared.  i had come to a place my master had never told me about.
i'll commit that to memory.
why not sit down and wait?
i really should get back. there's... there's something i'm supposed to do.
i see what you mean.
your foot! give me your foot!!
nothin' too showy!
what do you want to know?
that's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
hello.
--i know, i know--
if this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
what?
yes.
that's good... now go get yourself a beer.  you fellas have alotta the same power elvis had... y'all know this one?
i'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  well, i don't know what to say, leon.  when you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  i mean, what am i supposed to say?
bullshit! she was alive when we left her with you.
do you have many friends?
look at its insides.
today.
yeah!  tell him off!  it couldn't get any worse.
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods... so... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
it's paul's grandfather.
hello marylin.
you remember jeff rawson? -- we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
-- not yet --
reality tv and stay by the phone. that's what all wives-in-crime do...
it's blue. blue velvet.
i did not think so.
like hell they wouldn't.
perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. perhaps a bit more.
i don't think so.
shoot, doc, the only one i'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. that's all.
it is.  there's something we need to talk about.  something i need to ask you...
come over tomorrow and read it to me?
i don't like lamb.
yeah? no kidding. listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
yeah? where?
i don't know...
who said anything about "loser?" where do you get this word "loser?"
you watched the tape?  friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, mrs de moraes. they’re in the import-export business. they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
yes. chauncey is fine.
i'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
save your strength, lady.  get goin', buddy. no campin' here.
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits, volume two.
oh yeah, what'd he say?
what do you want?!
for what?
she had, i believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. there was a cop at the hearing. young guy with l.a.p.d. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. jackie being a stewardess and all.
i'm not the devil.
there are monsters! in the gelatin! there are monsters! in the gelatin!
it has to do with my father.
your luck's not with you now!
yes, sir.
isn't it funny?  you can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life. you can look at me.  which shows  a strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   but you <u>shy</u> when i say the name of god.
too hot in the lighthouse?
i warned you yesterday.
what? do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
you saved my life in alot of ways.
--i'm trying--
your lip's stopped bleeding, too, george.
who's the clown now?  huh?!  who's the fucking clown now?!
but uncle al! you said-
there is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin' sorority.
you asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
whoa, whoa, whoa.  "land-based maritime specialties." gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
she sure is!...an' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
they're already watching you. if they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. he'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest. that is enough.
yeah, okay. just gimme a minute to freshen up.
excuse me?
i see.  then may be you're safe as long as you only play bach.  he's german. kip is looking around the piano. hana giggles.
you don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
...still don't feel no heat.
yes.  something... conservative.
the point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
let's just forget it, i mean...
on now, stew, don't be too hard on her. i wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
have a good time. don't make it too late.
roger, wolf one.
so i'm gonna act!  ever since i can remember i've wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
we need you here. i can bring her in.
well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa - you'll mount mt. everest. i'll show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
that's why we came here, remember?
just you and quincy, baby.  i got a meeting.
allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
there's nobody else here...
uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
like maybe a big part?
i'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. we supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in southern california. so you can imagine.
we should stop seeing each other.
oh christ tom, i didn't mean it that way.
i'm afraid it is dr. johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
i don't know.
i think i'm falling asleep.
i'm like you. i don't believe in vampires, but i believe in what i saw.
mississippi?
we'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
first, i want to walk free with a letter, in english, from the prosecutor general dropping all charges. second, i want two first class tickets to london leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
i'm pulling up right now. evacuate the fucking van! plans have changed! <b> ext. texaco station -- next
you're shittin' me.  you know the beach boys?!
do you think i'm a fool?
it's good for me - i know them, i'm familiar with them.  it's good for you - you'll be compensated.  it's good for the army.  you know what i'm going to make?  artillery shells.  tank shells. they need that.  everybody's happy.
with god?
and that's why i think you fit in here.
about an hour and a half, because that's all the longer i've been gone.
yes. i'm cutting a record.
it isn't kathy.
he was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called springwood about eight miles from here.  guess what his murder weapon was? a glove with six-inch blades.
please.  when i came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. but something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  the whole thing is new to me. very new. i've got a confession to make to you.  baron, you are a crook.  you robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  may i have the salt?
...after you' re dead.  and when i give the word, do you understand...when i give the <u>word</u>...
ernie, i'm a rich tourist today. how about driving me home in style?
bond, i’m a civilian. this is my place. used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. i run my little business, i stay out of trouble...
it's dave.
i assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
got to, sam. you and i are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
then why did you leave?
yes.
right.  and what's your name, sir?
don't move, rudy!
too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
pete... go home.  come on, i'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... sandy?
we've had this conversation already, daniel.
what kind?
just shut up, ryan didn't kill wade.
this is a good one!  shut up, everybody! listen to this!  'the president of the united states to harry shapiro. greeting: having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' what do you know! so now i'm a draft evader!
you're a strange man, mr. hutton.
oh, stop that --  damn! be careful, there --
how much of this shit do they have, white!!
no, sir.
i'm serious, how did you know my name?
i'm not its master.
he must be tired -- this bontecou thing --
didn't mean nothin'.
what do i do?
thank you, josie mae.
are you finished with me?
o bon dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
garcetti thinks everything is shit. he doesn't even like dolphins.
how tall are you?
and i've got a witness!  your mr. white saw the crime.
little over two hours.
did you have fires at night?
how are you?
what time?
i tried your friends. they're not at that address any more.  but.
i really don't 'date' that much.
what line of work are you in now?
excuse us por favor! hey. let tits see her kid.
you know what. how long since we've seen each other?
what plan?
from here?  i don't know.  far.  far enough.
got something to show me first?
is that unusual?
yeah, i know.  me, too.
pff. they hardly even noticed you.
none of that, lady.
i told you to get lost. you forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
how much did they cost?
are you done?
oh.
didn't have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
oh, yes. give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
hi.
no.
call the fbi.  use a pay phone.  don't give 'em your name, dad.  just tell 'em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others.  that he's the nightingale.
there is no relevant precedent.
dude, get wisdom. we're about to board a seven hour flight. the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake?  you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
what the hell is going on here?
i'm your basic underachiever. can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
i see you've been out visiting the folks.
spit from your dad?
wants to share.
do you want to learn or not?
who are you?
we had a connection, didn't we? i can tell you one thing, though. ray didn't trust me. he was right. he's dead, but he was right.
you will survive this... donald. i promise you that you will survive. you must let me help you.  and when i clap my hands together, you will wake up.
in a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. that doesn't bother you?
i'm just bragging about how great you are.  i'm the luckiest man alive.
it's okay.  you...  you thought i was bad.
hello, tracy.
yes, my lord!
come here.
yes, master.
you are?
i don't understand.
for two hundred?
i don't know.  probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
wow.
you only pay me two-fifty a week.  i owe you fifty bucks.
don't you feel it?
alicia!  come here, have a seat.  show miss vale why you wear the mask.
this is the last thing she'll ever write. she'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
stuffed and baking.
i thought i told you not to answer the phone.
possibly, yes. that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. that's right...
no. it just made them feel better.
eh?
don't patronize me!  you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
okay, what else?
see you in jail.
see, a successful man like me has limitations -- i lose touch at a street level.  so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am.
the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. come on.
to check up on me?
i didn't ask you all that, sweet pea. i asked if you loved her.
like this...?
tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to casy.
well, you're the organizer. you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. but when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. you afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
pat gray'll do anything we ask him. that's why i appointed him.
hey, what more could i want? i survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. i'd say i feel almost as great as you look.
our prayers have been answered, turkle! our prayers have been answered!
the new belle and sebastian.  like it?
the man is a traitor!
too bad.  how 'bout a dress?
did she say that?
and if we evacuate, what do you want to do with o'brien?
he never jokes... perhaps the professor could use your computer.
i keep feeling like i'm forgetting something.
oh yeah, healed right up. no visible scars.
yes?
no. you son of a bitch!
no!
that doesn't sound dark.
she talks in her sleep.
we have time.
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope.  i don't want to go off half-cocked.
what's the question nobody's asking? why that building? why not the federal building?
i know.
hello, walter.  hi, louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
lotta beautiful women. it was fun to flirt.
well, it's kind of weird.
it is better to be the right hand of the devil,... than in his path. as long as i serve him, i am immune.
well, i'm only an employee, i ain't married to him.
you said ... one shot.
oh - okay, we ain't done with this... those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  we're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  i'm gonna visit my mom!
fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
yeah--
okay ... but just for tonight.
voices from an old dark house!
so you sold ninety thousand units. so what? does that mean you're a genius? you're a great artist? you're higher up the ladder? you got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
shut up.
yes, your majesty.
the last time was a chuck e. cheese party a year ago. he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
for your own sake... for the others... i...
you two ok?
i saw something, i saw...
call them.  trust me.
if we ivy leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'chink.' next thing i know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
a post office box.
what?
i've got to get ray to o'hare...  come on, let's hustle...  john!  call american express in pittsburgh for mr. morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
jamie, you're not mad at me. you're mad at landon --
he is. usually.
they think you did it.
help? hmm. it's possible. what did you have in mind?
easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
use the philosopher's stone!  hur- ry!  invocation!  release them!
i should be going.
i'm pretty sure it was you. hey, could i get your autograph now? it's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! i'm your biggest fan!
from what i hear you're doing great.  bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  making a lot of money, huh?
you really think she's been sent... by god?
because they deserve to, walter.
you saw the speedometer?
i think you do.
shut up!  the both of you.  ain't neither one of you too smart. especially you, boy.  don't you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  you smell like trouble.  stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
i'll pick you up at your place.  i'll bring along the roylance guide -- we can read after we eat.
or you didn't know what to do with it.
some of what?
ten seconds, people.  look sharp!
he's a great chef.
the fastest.
i don't want to hear any more about it. if you don't get married, i'll fire both of you.
about three days. i'm a monster. he's a monster. actually, we're both just guys. i don't expect you to understand that i...
hold those rights.
why?
my lucky scrunchie. it helped me pass spanish.
it's the least i can do. what did you say your favorite band was?
i'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. i came down here to tell you to back off.
he no!
'we might as well make the best of it.'
okay.  the important thing is not to panic.
the wind will be against us...
did you bring the cards?
got it earl.
this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
the only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. we gotta put it in a bank.
how much like it?  was it the same cat?
oh, no, no.  it won't be <u>that</u> long.
now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
that didn't sound very convincing.
yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
what is it man?
get behind him more.
the point was to love each other.
what you say is wonderful! but sad...
i said the job is okay.
that's what i heard.
well, lucky for me i found out. thank god i have friends like tucker.  look, i'm sick of talking about stalkers.  let's talk about you.
i don't know.
we understand your problem--
huh-huh....you son of a bitch!
no. no you said her body's been missing.
well, i just have the baby and give it to you, right?
she was wearing a helmet.  it could have been worse.
what do you mean, dear?
well, it's like this, bri'. i don't eat much in the mornin', never have. maybe a beer once in a while; lucky lager's my favorite.
shit.
miss scott panicked?
heil, baby!  i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
well, yeah... ok, but you're not listening to me. there are other things that need to be taken into account here. like the whole spectrum of human emotion. you're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
and something else, too, miss saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
anything like work aroun' here?
you ain't no indian. you're a sal mineo indian.
death, death.  how about the first thursday in march, ten o'clock.
you sonofabitch.
rick, i really think i'm in love.
all right, i will, i will.
hey, nick! god damn!... what've you been doin', i mean...
they left me stranded.  twice. what have you got to lose?
i've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
i sprayed your apartment. i took your key. i really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
yeah.  yeah. it bothers me a lot.  'cause, you see, twice, sarah -- once at ames with minnesota fats and then again at arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... now, why'd i do it, sarah? why'd i do it? i coulda beat that guy, i coulda beat him cold. he never woulda known. but i just had to show 'em, i just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. you know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... i don't care, bricklaying can be great. if a guy knows. if he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. i mean, when i'm goin' -- when i'm really goin' -- i feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. he's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. it's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. it's like all of a sudden i got oil in my arm. pool cue's part of me. you know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. it's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. you feel the roll of those balls. you don't have to look. you just know. ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. and you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
i just did it for tonight. i don't normally dress like this.
no!  do not be sorry!  never be sorry!  the king cares for nothing and for no one!  there are no mistakes when you are king!  what you do is right for every person!  a king has contempt for everyone!
i remember when i just saw you. skinny winnifred. jesus, you were skinny.
pretty good.
where are you going?
i don't wanna kill anybody. but if i gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
you, blum go motel.
i think you'll be able to remember it. i doubt you'll misquote me.
now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. it's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. it's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
fuckin' freezing.
yes. so you feel security, stability. like things are going to last awhile.
look at me.
...they been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up delilah.
who are you?
i do remember and i was impressed. anyway, that's all forgotten now. driver!
goodbye.
is there any way you could get into his truck?
i'm thirty-seven years old.
elizabeth, i think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
no thanks. i'll take care of it. we've got a lot of shit to talk about.
he tapped that.
you got me mad, that's why. hey, joe, show marty that picture.
the breath of god...
stay clear of folks you might see. there's plenty out lookin' to hang you. go on now, skedaddle.
can you walk?
what could cause a tincture like this?
well -- he died on a sunday and i have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels friday afternoon.
when townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "the time of transformation is near..."
i can't close these leads, john. no one can.  it's a joke.  john, look, just give me a hot lead. just give me two of the premium leads.  as a "test," alright?  as a "test" and i promise you...
please, can i have one to surge with?
yes, madame. you see, i have to get up very early.  my little brother goes to school--  you see, mother is dead.
if i could have anything... this would almost do.
yes, but, you're a willing participant. picture edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
who are the other characters?
where would i have seen your work?
no way that could just be seawater.
i played the cards i was dealt, wyatt.  your problem is you're always trying to play someone else's.  allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free: there is no happiness, wyatt there is no normal life.  there's only life, that's all.  just life. the rest is relative.
unusual design for a contemporary piece.
i'm nervous--my old man's here.
i'm stuck!
like mrs. thorwald's wedding ring. if that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
i am not afraid.  read it!
mind if i change the station? better traffic reports on am.
i'm happy to cooperate.  you don't need to tie me down.
morning, doc.  awful early, aren't ya?
well that's a very offensive way to put it. you shouldn't say that. you were taught that, weren't you?
thanks.
nobody knows his name.  that's his thing.  he always wears a mask.  you never see his face.  he calls himself "machine," that's what they call him.  machine.
ah! let us begin!
that won't happen again.  we're different.
roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? it's important we establish a rapport. something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
well... i know i should reject that offer, but i'm not going to.
we got a plan!
fine.  so call her.  get her over here.
why you?
you must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
okay, my man. love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
i'm glad you think so. if you ask me, it's foolish. i told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. we could make new york in less than three hours.
if there is a keyser soze he'll be looking for you.
don't bullshit me! don't fuckin' bullshit me!
yes,  she's a little odd, i understand.
charles! what's up, man?
i shall avenge you --
but of course! please make yourself comfortable. perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
i suppose you think this is very funny, harold.
yeah, well i turned off the set. i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. you know what could've happened? the dog came in and stepped on it, turned the tv back on.
i'll be fine, hanna.  thank you.
it was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  i knew that was too much.
no way.
and ze rope?
shaw.  clay shaw.
we were married two years before the baby.  and then four very difficult years.
how dare you tell me to run my affairs!
so not everyone can be a poet. still, i respect the sentiment.
jesus. we've been at this for six months.
you won't want to watch. turn around.
i meant it for one. i meant--sam foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can i at the moment--
my job.
i mean, it's there, reggie. if only we could see it. we're looking at it right now.
i don't know what to...
yeah, of course they let me out. chickenshits. i gotta pay some class c misdemeanor ticket. so did i call it or did i call it? she spent the night, didn't she? hm? oh, that sucks for you, pal. oh, shit.
you don't want that.  it's married and it's the neighbor.
so are you, but i think maybe you should shut up now...  ... i'm not coming up to your apartment.  that was never my idea.
don't dismiss me. i'm trying to include you in this decision. he's your friend.
no --
no, i mean your past. about why you were in here.  i'll take you first thing in the mornin'. you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? i just can't let you stay here. it's the rules. if something happened well, i'd be liable.
can we talk?
at church?
i'll call you, when you're on your way.
no, no, it's my fault.  i've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
taking my boyfriend to the airport.
you can't believe that.
that's right, fink, he lives next door to you.
no, no, no.  you gotta listen to the way people talk.  see, you don't say like "affirmative" or some shit like that.  you say... no problemo.
no. but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? or simply love me... because i love you?
i'm sorry, mr. daglish, this is the mille collines. no working girls here.
there's no one here.
how could i forget?  you make quite a first impression.  sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  i've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, dave. legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  i'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
yes.  say goodbye, toto.
where is she?
what.
i don't want to hear anymore about it. i'm not going, and that's final.
no. thanks.
it there's one thing i don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
sez you!
don't worry about me.  where are we going?
okay, arms up, lean forward.
...later.
no, but i'm listening.
yes it was. betty saw the whole thing! your killer's name is chloe...
i wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
my child, i don't think its a great mystery what craig's up to.
look at the treads on those.
in the brain, i tell you. i know.
is your poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with god almighty?
i don't mind. smuggling. guilty. i come from arc. smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
that's the whole point, jeffrey. that's the whole point. anyone's. everyone's. they are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. they are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. don't you understand?
look, she's right.  we'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. i feel... confident.  c'mon.
let's be democratic.
well, when i walked up the block, i ... well, my word!
bobby--
yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
hm.
yeah. yours?
first thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  alan has put together sort of a training program
yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
i'm in here.
i'm sorry, i'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  do you mind?
we'll sell it. sell everything.
bastards took off, though, didn't they?
and the stones?  did you find them in the wreckage?
i didn't know tony bennett painted.
sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
clean?
i'll know when i find it.
how do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... it may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... how can you know?
course i like him, i like pizzas to but i'm not gonna marry one.
i love you too, letty.     i love you, too.
her destination was halifax, yeah.
he's why i watch jerry.  jerry's the bait for jonas.
jen...
why?
it's susan's cooking, claire.  that's why uncle james lets them stay.
i finished it.
am i scarin' ya?... your pussy wet?... come on... is it?...  hey, don't jump back so slow... i thought you was a bunny... bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... mean somethin', don't it?... means somethin' to me... means you want bobby peru... you want bobby peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a christmas present.
i wanna be with you today.
he's always right.  go ahead.  pick a virgin.
wow.  why would they do that?
hello..
yeah, what is it?
they got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  if they knew what i know, you would probably be dead.
i think it must have been a sea- gull.
it is not.
so, when can we do it?
one kiss, my love.  for luck.
great!  bring 'em in!  bunny, i gotta run.
i was looking forward to this evening.
read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. we'll say it came today. it'll set his mind at ease.
"i sound like an idiot watching the parade i know there's no tomorrow only the charade i am dead deep inside my head all the lies there's no then only now i will love show me how"
the cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. they didn't show till after mr. blonde started shooting everyone.
i'm afraid i... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
for everything.
maybe i have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, susie.  you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob, the cia, fbi, and army intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  we got leaks everywhere! we're going to trial here!  what the hell do we really got?  oswald, ruby, banister, ferrie are dead.  shaw - maybe he's an agent, i don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
there's been an accident.
yes.
you guys do all the odd jobs.
royal victory party?  will...will princess bala be there?
how's your sister pearl?
my place.
god damn it i'm sick of you calling me "meat"!  you wanta step outside!
when did you talk to harry?
i don't know what you're talking about.
i don't make the distinction. but the sex urge is a powerful force. in women just as much as men.
i don't know, bob.  i'm flattered and all, but i've got a kid, now.
always.
i don't know.
divorce? an alcoholic relative?  tell me, did chip torture animals when he was young?
oh, nice.
least you can do.
no.
look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. look for a kind heart.
no -- impressed.
uh...
i know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
well, yes, she's happy. of course dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. there isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
we won.
bullshit! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
carl??? carl did this?!!
i'll pay extra
i want you to keep looking right here, okay?
yes, his girlfriend.
what else?  you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
you're imagining it.
it's okay.
trina honey, he just wants to find arlyn page.
this isn't a very good place to talk.
stan.
yes, sir.
let's go.
what?
somewhere else?
well, that's good now, ain't it, bill? seein' claudia an...?
scottish?
so you lost a handbag, madame?
uh, do you mind if i wait? i really need to talk to her.
shall i go get a cappuccino?  ease the pain.
no -- only occasional jobs. 
how do i leave here?
where's your missus?
watch yourself!!
well, you know, "the whole thing's theatre..."
yep...  yes...  it is.
you've read the transcript. it's all there.
just like that?
don't get all worked up, justin. i expected some common sense on your part and clearly i was expecting too much. [beat] just open the drawer.
i heard a strange sound...
what did you say, brother?
theo rode for this place a long time, man.
you mean, again?
nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i don't know what i'm doing.  i mean i'm acting like i've got it all together tonight.  but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her.  and i don't know what i'm gonna say.  so now it's like, maybe i'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
if junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having dunbar dead.
of course.
if she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
candy. candy kendall.
getting too hot in here for you?
schoolboy tings is you head. badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
come on, alex, let's just get to alex's.  your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. god, i'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  what the hell's a nintendo?
what?
it's a free country, isn't it?
excited.
-- don't sweat it, i have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
maybe i'm losing interest in my book.
zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
egypt.
you remember this?
make some money, dick, prove yourself to the wall street crowd and let goldwater and rockefeller take the fall against kennedy.
doing what?
it belonged to my dad.
a maid must beware of flattery... methinks you want to kiss me.
get away!
tomorrow morning. start hitch-hiking right away and...
no -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
hey!
it's all right.  i don't like it, but it's over now.
how could i? i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
we're down to a "couple" now, huh?
i would never miss anything that you had written. you must know that.
so early?
have we?
...you gonna kill me?
everybody likes to, don't they?
he didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
i'll talk real slow.
the fuck you been doin' to me?
permant cortex bond.
made no sense. scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. nada.
you do?
she's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
no!
here we go.
because i am the director.  don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
who's your daddy!
yes.  but there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - i don't share credit.
shorthand. really?
and you should.  your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
what are you -
-- you were with her. you were in the cab, weren't you?
it's not the black beverly hills, it's the black palos verdes. anyway, this chick, elois, was a man-eater- upper. i bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. you know who she looked like? christie love. 'member that tv show "get christie love"? she was a black female cop. she always used to say "you're under arrest, sugar."
it's a very pleasant room, ben.
you strike me with words as hard as steel.
... nothing.
lead the way, murman.
to the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
don't worry. fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian.  i just put this on for sentiment. the rest are absolutely safe. i assure you. but if you feel like notifying the police...
so are you.
i'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel.  with kelly.
that's been said before.
enjoy your last night...  ...where's otis?
thank you, david ... and a very merry christmas to you all.
god, but i love that macho talk! emergency generators! the indian used campfires.
it's the lebaron.
i just want to get it over with.  my mom's making me do this. i just want to forget it.
certainly!
open it.
father adelfio, i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. and you've got to help me, because i've lost all peace of mind...
i'm sorry about your arm.  kabuo and i.  are very sor...
how's about it, bart?
look, i'm sorry about this, but i'd like "the upsetter" by lee "scratch" perry, in there.  instead of "sin city."
i came to get you! what do you think?
... we, we love her, dick and me ...
so that stuff -- it kills people.
okay.  michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
thanks.  old nell's my girl all right.  al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
na.
yes.
yeah.
yeah, maybe some chicks too. heh heh.
look it's very simple. you tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and i'll invent it. we'll be partners. fifty—fifty.
yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  the report says 'recent origin'.  how recent?  as much as 24 hours before death?
you mean...?
i read about them in time magazine.  when these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the los angeles international airport where you will be given further instructions.  you have two hours to comply.
wah...?  where are...?
tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic.
sounds great.
he doesn't hear too well.
no.
what?
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
how is she?
no... i have a... room... at the hotel de perrin.
i'd have to bleach my hair.
i don't want to leave.
take yourself. you've slept with several women. are you happier because of it?
i don't know about that. she was pretty into it. but i wasn't gonna try. the whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. show 'em some respect.
no.
doesn't look good.
they know me.
you didn't like them.
what for? i got a pound of stuff in my jacket i've been carrying around all day. we gotta start taping it to your leg.
what happened to jim?
that's so weird...
he's a pyjama case, really.
you fit a lot of descriptions.
veronica... i... it's not like that anymore... i mean, it was never really like that...
you got that right.  now get up. we're walking out of here.
i was thinking that, uh...you know, while i was up there and all...that maybe i could, you know...try to meet a girl.  i've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max, max has agreed to deliver job to me. iíll have claire and luther stickell with me on the train.  marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris.
a shot caller. a boss, a capo. he's running shit.
arnie, thank god.
yeah.
he's gone to dinner! search the place. i can't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you.
i'm sick of this place. i'm going to try out for the lakers. they need a power forward.
dad, please.
alright!  alright... put me down...
normal. what's normal? does normal exist? and if it did, how would we know it?
does one exist?
i asked them to give me a couple minutes...
unfortunate that i know the truth?
oh great.  could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
uh... got any cinnamon?
really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
how many... how many people are missing?
where?
who says i'm the one that called it off?
if i were investigatin', i'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day.  you been duck hunting?  i think oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  what'd he say?  "i'm just a patsy."  out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
this is -- what?
i've remembered something else...
it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
wait a minute.
so, are you on for the next one?
you know who they are?
danny, what makes you think you know all this?
you live in miami?
don't. i know what you're going to say.
oh no, no...
selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
you don't know where you are.  you missed the shipping lanes.
what?
i said i'd call you the minute i got free.  and i did -- and here we are.
sure did.  he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road.
lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
spooked.
that don't hardly say it. he shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
please --
uh-huh. so what's he look like?
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  and jumping in...
fire! i hate fire!
say, bill. that business in jackson county... did that really happen? i mean how they say it happened?
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
give him a chance.  he's speaking our language, not the other way around.
do you want to stay?
i'd like to sit for you again.  but only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  okay?
tell m'sieu giron i can't see him now. impossible!  and, jacques. dismiss the car! madame is not going. 
air... water... your "sun."
like you, i'm good at it.  but at this exact moment in time...like i gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
wow. you've had quite an evening.
you seem to appreciate the local scenery.
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me. i'm gonna die, i know it.
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
perhaps you've been counting my acres, mrs. fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor i really am.
no, no, on the football field. they called me...  ...the smallville flash.
are you sure it's an opera?
you come in here at least three times a day.  you a retard?  a buck fifty.
it was released in philadelphia, probably on june 14, 1995.
dozen times a day.
look.  there's the order:  you wrote it:  desalvo, bianchi & buono, berkowitz and dahmer.  it's going to be dahmer next.  which means he'll kill a man.
i know plenty of boys.
is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
dad, this is ridiculous. just open it.
i was too busy.
tremoille, i'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
no.
god bless you, sir.
that's a good question.
and who did the voice belong to?
to who?
do you?
sh, talby, don't bother me now.
it was warriors plus 6 this morning.
it was my fault. you aren't old enough to use the wand. i shouldn't have given it to you.
got a handkerchief?
well, good luck. but be careful.  you know you're being shadowed?
love holds you to me. and we are in danger, not you.
and the fireworks. hand me that box, marty.
a blank canvas!  i could paint your portrait, directly on you. or maybe not.  so, you?  husbands? boyfriends?  girlfriends?  where do you live?
i've already got something worked out.  be seeing you.
headache -- squire?
i know, i built it.  i've just never seen it this way.
you go home!
nick, you're so strange...
yeah.
it shall be done, your majesty.
oh?
you gotta stop thinking like that.
i like frank. he's a good boy. me and him's made friends.
do you want them?
i don't know. nothin'. wouldn't be no point to it.
too many cooks --
$20.
pre-opening jitters.
yeah?!
it's okay, don't bother, harry.
yes.
get her out of circulation - i've put her on the detention list.
are you just making that up to make me feel better?
oh well -- you've got to do them.
h-hi.
fuck.
it's ok.i know what you were feeling.
if there isn't i've just wasted the last six months.
all right, gentlemen, i will find it myself. now let's see.
you've got enough people kissing your ass.
oh, but it will end well for love?
dr. lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. transsexuals are very passive.
i'm not a violent man, mr. lowry. not by nature, anyhow.  but if you hurt liza in any way, i'll kill you.  does that seem honorable?
you're crawling around like a--
who's there?
yeah.  and it's better than not believing it their faces are inches apart.
you cocky little bastard.
by myself?
want some?
she was selling birds.
why?
i'm onto something, marlon - something big.
you are <u>defending</u> what you did?
not without you.
oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
harlin around?
what are you doing?
a spirit.  perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
you got my note!
lost my eyes on okinawa.  lost them fighting the war.  fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
we'll get it later.
well, if the guy is far, in a car, and i know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, i think i would plastic the car, with a remote here. i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic.
still too risky for my money.  we're running out of time here. this is kiss! a victory for one is a victory for the team. i'm sure i can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. we'll reconvene at that intersection...
it wasn't a trick!
threats won't make me love you.  tis not the way of the human heart.
yeah.
scuse me, hon, fraid i'm only half here. maybe you oughta run on along. but why don't you take this phone number?
call me sonny-boy.
you met him. walt waldowski, the dental officer.
nothing...
checkmate.
what?!
what?
could be a lot of things. depends on the freezer.  i'm sorry, mack, but i don't think this is the answer.
nice work.
i want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
you're not a bitch.
i told you -- keep away.  i don't know what we do now.
yeah sort of. where's lloyd?
dave - !
from what i've seen, mr. galvin, you have a very good case...
i'd like to see that, sayer. invite me.
jordan, dear.  how are they treating you?
we know it's his fucking homework, walter!  where's the fucking money, you little brat?
that's it.  get out.
i don't know.  i really don't know.
they're dead, john.
i don't know.  do i?
you forgot her degree in literature. she's a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it's about?
yes sir.
i was wrong about you. and <u>i'm</u> sorry.
mostly people in the casino business. a few drug dealers.
projections were far too optimistic.
it is, if you like idiots...
that's what he's been doing since last heard from.
the grandson of victor 'fronkonsteen'?
i thought these people were broke.
yeah.
am i lying?  are you sure?  are you absolutely sure i'm lying?  then explain to me about the jellyfish.  earlier.  why did we see jellyfish?  harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  you do.  they're your fear, aren't they?
make up your mind, trigger.
i think most people right now have other priorities.
but he didn't. and neither did you. and i'm glad about that.
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
working...i'm trying to figure out where to start.
any happier than any other asshole in life.
hey, i never said i was a fighter pilot...i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. i can find contentment in a good book. i don't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire. sometimes...i just get happy being with the right man.
i can't, i have to go home.
out in india. so character-forming for the british. not the heat. good lord, no. the rain, dash it. a good monsoon. fifteen inches overnight. a whole week of lovely rain. i remember one summer in jaipur ...
i should've danced with you.
get up.
roper...
no you don't. and fuck you for saying you do. and fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. because there could be a way, grady.
mary's a little chubby, huh?
i think we'd better go look for him.  david!
alright?
would you like anything?
why?
jim, i've got to go.  i'm already late--
in richard nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  if i were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
i don't remember you saying no.
then i'll get caught.
you never thought that's a heavy load?
you're not going anywhere.
--nothing!
i like you, dil --
remember this.  and remember it always.  i'm proud of you.  and i love you too, son.
it can't be.
not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
only on odd days.
it's crazy and dangerous. my god. i shouldn't have told you.
yeah, like al capone on tax day. get the keys?
beats the hell outta me.
the renting agent and the tailor.
no.  i was being unrealistic. even thinking about living this life.
i'm sure starfleet would approve, sir.
still no word from star command. we're not that far from the spaceport --
when did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
do we need words?
is there a rush?
i used my body on the guards.  it gave me control. i got to a gun and i took my chance.  i’ve never told anyone that.
that's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. i must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
why are you following me?
let's hope so. sally if he asks me again, i'm gonna tell him i returned it all.
okay. then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
what'd your father do?
no, dad.  i have thoughts of my own once in a while.
yeah, i was there.
yes, mr. bernstein.
let’s go.
that's what the newspapers thought.  she spent the rest of her life in the asylum. after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
sorry, don't have the time.
the decision is final.
yeah--the blind foster home mother. it was good. i got cahoon on it.
i'm scared!
you aren't going to the party?
it's me, honey. it's mom.
well, but it was so long ago. we were so different back then...
you will not carry any other pagers with you. you will not carry anything, for that matter, that i have not just given you.
am i wrong?
wrong.
yes.
then do it the way you want.
she knows where i live and breathe. she's coming after me.
revenge.
a deal's a deal.
well great. the pleasantville marathon starts at six thirty.
stop it. the money's fine. it's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
anything, ninotchka.
fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
aye.
i don't know.
you want to read it?
jason  you think you could-get any closer to those mines?
run. run. let's go.
tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
it's all right for a bachelor.
why?
you got to get up from here, girl.
i'm not at liberty to say. sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. we'll be in touch.
which part of the room is mine?
he's doped to the <u>gills</u> ...
to not do that.  to not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
certainly!
i hope it feels so good to be right. there is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
no ! just get up. this is serious.
yes, sir.
a handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. doctors, people who have to touch you. but not by people who want to.
whichever one i want.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  seven times!  seven.
there's a dead body in the exhibit! people are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
i've been thinking--
come on. let's go.
nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
no.
keep talkin', preacher.
and i wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and i want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
"in her dream"?
i don't know what you are saying.
what makes sammy run?
two ships decloaking, sir! romulan!
call me later, hon.
in a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. i'm a wreck. no rest for the wicked, y'know. it wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then i had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. so that if i could have activated the launch  -- well, lex luthor would've hit the spot.  there's a little place on route 190. dead on the practice optimum stress point of the san andreas fault. it wouldn't mean much to you, superman, but i call it...target zero.  pancho's taco palace...
what?
but, i don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? i mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
thanks.
yes i do.
wait.  wait.
yes sir.
i don't think so, he should be along soon...
what's the dif --
no, mr. powers, i expect them to die. even after they pay me the money, i'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  all right, guard, begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.
why?
sorry...  i was thinking of stewart. what d'you suppose happened?
behold!
he's right.
yesterday.  afternoon.
any idea who could've done it?
do you realize what your saying, gibson?
we'll just be a minute.  get a little more sleep.
fine.
can you do it mike?
that's right on time.  this is my friend, vito.  his pops is sal.
"then have my lips the sin that they have took."
i can't help the traffic.
you're really twisted, gordon. you're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
take your time.
this girl on a dock. white dress. never said a word to her.
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
i'll be back.
no where. we've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
c'mon, man ...
find the jacket.
i wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
the liquors lovely. the rest of the party you can have.
no, you are.  i know exactly what you mean.  it's not that you're missing something.  it's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. you just didn't see it until they came along.
the feds?!
what happened, did you hit him?
f-f-fuck you.
what seems to be the problem?
he's a very talented musician.
i better just go in and see her.
'e.g.' means 'for example', ray. i think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
what?
money!
i'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
you lying bastard...
i bet.
actually, mel does his own ass work. why wouldn't he?  it's delicious.
wish i was.  oldest part of the system down there.  we're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
isn't that brad and janet majors sitting down front?  what an ideal couple.
i like it here with you.
well, that's pathetic. poor rose, what a life she has had.
kay.  all i'm saying--
don't crowd me, craig.
richard nixon's going to be president. nixon wears hats.
take the card.
why?
where ben?
second you get something on those teeth, i want it
-- and now you're going to pee some more.
i'll give you a hint. if you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a jaguar...
you just drove a fucking customer away, barry.
it's been going on for a while.  then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
he's under!
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
will it?...
i'm not holding my breath in that department.
- or hard wired, right.  first line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. basically impenetrable, i'd say.
what's my end?
well. we've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
you go to hell.
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
you know him so well.  but i'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
it'll take the pain away.
oh my, my,
how the hell should i know?
no.
and almost got tossed out of the academy...
what?
ammo?
commander powell would have named it.
that's all right. if i think of something, i'll send my butler over to tell you.
well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
no, i have a cat.
he makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  and he records it all.
what's the question mark?
something wrong with that?
means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
what?
it's my fault. i shouldn't have...i didn't think...
you'll find one of those people.
they're going to arrest me.
oh.  you're serious.
i'd wash that out with some iodine...  okay, mercurochrome.
it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  you've seen their security system.  they know who works there.  even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
prevacid.  for my stomach.
it is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
mr. bartholomew -- if i had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, i'd know it.
i think so.
maybe it was more than that.
'the deepest, darkest secrets --'?
very well.  if you tell me not to worry, i shan't.
really? you don't mind?
where are you going?
i'm done.  find another cab.
clark, you want me to come in after you?!
what are you talking about?
you knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  he had command of the king's english.
juneau.
may i ask why?
martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
holy shit, yes!
well, we might as well start filling it in now. as long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so i can get to it, we're set. use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - we'll neaten it up later.
all is fair in "heaven," ted-baby.
no, jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
we sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
yes, are you okay...?!
rennie's not coming.
marooned on ceti alpha v. he's completely mad, admiral. he blames you for the death of his wife...
yeah.  it's french.
upstairs. getting cleaned up.
i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
darrell?  you know he and jake are...
i don't know. 'guess i belong here more than there.
exact patterns. the energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. but why?
--colson.
don't go getting sentimental. you're no damn good at it.
good for you.
hm.  you think we should ask them for their landscaper?
i never wear a hat.  oh, so i am. i forgot.  i guess i'm terribly sorry again, mrs. west.
eddie murphy.
missed you too, cousin.
i think i understand what you have in mind...
hello, mrs. webster.  is china there?
i'm scared. three kids are dead. i want to go to this party.
rocky, would you be interested in --
what am i scared of?
yeah, well thanks, but i got enough to hold me.  my mother can send me some.  i don't know.
go on.
pest control, gotta do your apartment.
as long as your soldiers attack civilians, i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  and my men are excellent marksmen.
yes, sir!--i will, sir--certainly, sir!
how'd you know i'd do it.
what for? you haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
there was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
if i was you, mr. mast, i'd watch my language.
yes –– charge.
do you want to come to argo city?
i certainly hope so.
but i'm not a killer!
relax, george. it's gonna go great. trust me. have i ever lied to you?
... so much like her?
we also got bill mulderig and phil klein.
are you from up there? space?
i don't think i'll persuade you. you'll do it or you won't. dr. bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
what if it wasn't you that i came back to see?
no, you don't understand. your daughter-
`code blue,' what does that mean...?
and then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because i've gone down on a couple guys!
you think she's sailing without a crew?
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin.
i don't think so. not yet anyway. and besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. he reminds me of steve in a way. steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. he just shouldn't be married.  at least not to me. you getting hungry? i'm hungry.
you should go on a trip.
what color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
yeah, i know, but poultry...?
didn't they tell you?
then what?
because i don't want to ruin things.  because home is where the heart is.
she's wondering what's happening.  we're losing air faster than i thought.
if there are, we'll all be dead.
yes, i saw it.
the touch?
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, i didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  so it's been just sitting in the hotel.  but then... you came, so i figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
roger, north island. please advise pending further information. over.
sybok, listen to me. in order for this craft to enter the landing bay, enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
movin' in's mighty thirsty work. i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. come on over and join me, if you want.
...the big apple, new york, new york.
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
who was it?
i'll be waiting on deck.
but change always comes slowly.  i've withdrawn more than half the troops. i'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  i want an all-volunteer army.  but it's also a question of american credibility, our position in the world ...
yes?
nor did you, i noticed.
funny, the kind of men women fall for.
when you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. you guessed but you didn't know.
just call me a cab.
yes - i have had it for years.
you sure?
you son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
a bit sadistic, don't you think, captain...?
you scare me, riddick. that's what you wanna hear, isn't it? there, i admit it, can i get back to work now?
oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to joint...
senator jonathan kendall, of ohio.
never one.
who did?
yeah, and i-i tru- you know, i trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
the slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
right back to you.
oh.
this is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
what're those?
i'll never get out of here in time.
let's get you inside . . . .
this is the perfect time. you know what makes a good detective? the number of confessions they get. you're a good detective, osborne. so now you get mine.
but have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
born and bred.
you proposing what i think you're proposing?  don't you think i'm a little young for you?
were you and my father having an affair?
are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
lyssa, your bracelets. bend them straight and cross them.
fat little baby, crying for mommy.
you're the one who said he was good looking. you think he's good looking 'cause i know you think he's good- looking. i'll smash his face inside out. i'll make him into dog meat. nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
pull over, everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
they're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  they may do some more folk dancing.
do you know where i found this?
you don't give a shit about anything do you?
exactly what i was about to ask about me.
think i'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. anybody wanta come with me?
that's right.
uh-huh.  i'll be right back.
stop this. this isn't funny.
what? oh, come on. you're not gonna suck my cock?
yes, michael.
wha -- what do you want?
now look rozengurtle, we're sorry. just relax.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
hiding.
well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
your serve. two -- eighteen.
for what? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
i am? may i go now?
everyone needs something.
i think they were catholics.
but?!!
brill's dead. he died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a kansas field.  my name doesn't matter.
i want the <u>same</u> drink.  cause it did me <u>good</u>... but i already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, i would like another.
to the left twice then five no... sorry... i think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
i don't know why. as long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
the bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
he is dead!  by god's choice!  there is nothing to discuss.
damn you, blair!  you've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
hi. i'm jimmy.
i could crush you like a roach.
suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
what else?
second district, casbah, west algiers.
it's mister marion.
sunlight, you say?
has she talked with you since prison?
and you know what you ask for?
aha.
i always wear gloves when i shoot people.  a bad joke--but better than tears.
i think the facts speak for themselves. the same noble picard blood runs in our veins. had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as i am. look in the mirror, and see yourself.
waiter! check, please!
that's too bad.
you mean that happy child?
why are you so uptight?
you the magician?
tell me what it was.
what do you mean?
he's learning his letters.
follow me.
who?
yes?
ha, ha.
perfect for a swim, isn't it?
it may have been maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
because, i'll take it.
sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
tor.  have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
yeah. i knew you'd catch on eventually.
i have answers for you.
it's a strain of the plutoxin 7 virus. genetically engineered. 100% pure death. complete nervous system shutdown. you crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. not a pretty sight.
what!?
you think....there could've been something up in those woods that anna--
your evil is that you cannot be evil! and i will suffer for it no longer!
wonderful. what's she like, brother? what is your impression of her?
no.
i was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. i also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  any idea who chloe or lonnie are?
well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
love that name.
would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
not with the right girl you wouldn't.
okay, call them. fine. oh-- and if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
oh, yeah!
can i tell you something?
not for the actions of another. no one is responsible for any actions but his own. human beings -
majesty, i can't...
now that i'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
you mean leave the magazine?
we're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
back home, we call him the miracle worker.
not sometimes.  always.  just because it is the hard way.  you're that kind of man, jeff.
why?
everyone's capable of murder, osborne.
oh, that.
i hope it's nothing serious.
sure.
peter parker, you have no idea what i did this weekend.  or didn't do. it's no business of yours either way.
what does it look like ... i'm collecting empties.
he's probably outside.  you know how he is. gets bored...
bullshit!
honey, i gotta go.
it's a flop house.
as you prefer, squire.  as you prefer.
sure.
forget it.
well, aren't you going to invite me?
you have forgotten my last name?
where?
what?!? don't tell me you're buying this?
who?
that's good. very good. now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
that is one of my mission parameters.
okay.
george, he wasn't asking.
attempted murder.
assuming we can trust joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? he's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. even if joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... jesus christ! i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. if i was him, i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
what's art esparza?
you just walk away.
i don't know.  when i met my wife, it was so clear.  i just <u>knew</u>.
yeah. tryin' to find the file and erase it. once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. just eddie and his master control program, runnin' things from on high..
yep.
that's okay. it's not really my business. i have wondered though. why was it? was it like a nervous breakdown?
he's on to something bigger.
lions and tigers and bears!
no, dr. hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  they are science.  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
thank you, mrs. rexroth.
god, you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew.
now, now do you belive me? i told you demille would jump at it.
i got through.
it is already done.  i have just stopped at mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
and he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.
where? sanctuary? can you take me there?
i didn't see my prednizone.
hi.
yes?
well, what are you talking about? i just told you i was gonna get a—
i'll be there.
madrid or barcelona?
i know where she went.
i'm impressed: i don't think evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
there's nothing there for me.
what? no you're not..
and hu li killed him for the plates.
gettin' in is easy. it's getting out i'm thinkin' of.
you call your son little chief?
i can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
the what?
you think i'm fucking around here? mark it zero!!
no good. i said they disabled the communications system.
beautiful day, isn't it?
mmmmmmmmmmmm.
h'm. this appears -- i say appears -- to be properly drawn. but you shall not have this man! a man isn't property! mr. stone is an american citizen, and no american citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
same old reed. all analysis, no action. wasn't that the problem with you two?
no harm no foul.
go on. tell me more about her.
aren't you late?
you porked his wife the day he was arrested.  how could you forget that?
you're as bad as my father.
you better come see this.
i'd heard that.  but she's well?
up on the coast. about sixty miles north of here.
i don't know.
what?
how can that be? he was getting better.
i'm going to call the police.
forty-four. they're on special this week from the canary islands. a real bargain.
i am thirty two.
you're a peach.
i haven't set foot off dry land since i was twelve, when the ship i was on exploded.  it's been a sound policy.
when one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to?
i'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. in this job you have to unwind. otherwise it'll kill you. i mean that.
o, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
i'm good - i was just making a delivery near here, so i thought i would see if you were about...
probably.
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
nothing!  what the hell are you doing down there?
no ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
...not that time...
are you going to deny it?
jesus h. christ!
like her?  i don't know if i ever liked her.  it's just you want what you can't get.
that's what i was hoping you'd tell me.
yes, of course... well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, mr. merrick. good day.
excuse me, i need to explain...
i would love to be satisfied harry powell don't think i've got that money somewhere.
michelle, she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace.
look, this is a bad time...
mhm.
luthor, i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
enhance it.
my mom uses color-safe bleach.
counselor?
no.
well, the line of the jacket -- no really....just very nice...just right. i wish i could be there.
words can hurt very much.
i don't like loading crates.
someone should be with you.
i thought you had play practice.
don't call me that! don't call me anything!
did they have any explanation for this?
where's the challenge in that?
the other bombers might have more luck. we shouldn't just give up...
i don't know them.
don't hurt him...
no, stay in the car.  i want you to understand something.  if i intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
did he say who?
sit down!
listen to what i've ... listen to... does anybody know morse code?
jorge.  when i get out of here i'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
the same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
good idea.
maternity ward, huhh!
the... chain helps.
you're referring, of course, to chairing the special operations group as vice president.
no.
we had to take shelter in the checkpoint. jesus, wes, i killed the iraqis in there.
come with me, honey.
ya always in a bad mood --
you're sure...
how be dat?
kelvin, she begged me.  i had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  she walked into it and disappeared.  she was gone.
perhaps a small amount of money.  how much do one of your motion pictures cost?
engaged to render an opinion.  for a price.  is that correct?  you're being paid to be here today?
i don't drink coffee...
you mean like career?  uh, i don't know.  i've, i've thought about this quite a bit sir, and i'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, i don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  i don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career i don't want to do that.  so, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but i can't work for that corporation, so what i've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but i think it's got a good future.  as far as career longevity goes, i don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but i can't really tell if i'm great until i've had a couple of pro fights. but i haven't been knocked out yet.  i don't know, i can't figure it all out tonight sir, i'm going to hang with your daughter.
you got it in a bar?
because i was partially to blame. i wasn't around as much as i should have been. i forgot how to love her.
buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
oh.  like i'm not an interesting person.
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york -- why won't he come on!?
c'mon judge we got to start somewhere.
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
no! i -- all right, look, if you hear from ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
i misplaced an important complaint. that's their story. want to hear mine?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
<u>i'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

exactly anything.  whatever you want.  whoever you want to be.  fabri, get us another round, would you.
gimme a break. you buy bluestar airlines yesterday. today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. you must have esp. a real nostradamus.  jesus christ, what are friends for?
uh-huh.
listen, fritz, if i have to listen to another word from you i'll give you a fucking good hiding.
she's nosy.  she hears me on the telephone.
what are we gonna do up there?
i can't find the second one, sir.
it's a tradition.
they're here, they're fine. in the dressing room.  see you later --
okay.
are you trying to get under my cape, doctor?
ah. well. congratulations. meanwhile, what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
you got absolute zero.
oh no, i couldn't.
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries. i treasure them. as you should.
no.
so why's he do it?
well, look, i'm sorry to have bothered you.
no....
switch nostrils?
nothing! jesus! i gotta fight with you now?
maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
i ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
yes.
chicken salad, devra!
lara --
starla, it ain't --
i hate to do this, fella.
who doesn't work?  don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
i'm trying.  there.
i don't mix with the boys. i work here. let's keep it professional.
droppen sie dead!  raus mit dem ofen. los! los!
careful? was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while i was still in ze womb?
whatta you mean? you're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
there is no other way. you asked me why the beast had come this time.
i never thought about it.
oh, then you are...
i hope they're doing better than we are. we don't even have helmets.
relax now, sarah --
i'd rather you not be here.
marylin! listen to me.
yes?
by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
whoa, hey, whoa.  business.
yes!!!!
yup.  he was jeriko's manager.  bummer, tran!  lost your golden goose.  couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
what's that, peanut?
about twenty-five years ago. they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
i know a lot of songs about pirates, but none i'd teach a child.  let's hear it.
it worked!  there they go!
he.  can't.  answer.
....why does he do it...?
doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
"if he could" what?  you mean your father?
okay.  how'd yours go?
thank you.
there won't be any rest of the trip. over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. so keep your money. you'll need it for the fare. i'm fed up with you. i was fed up with you before we started.
i lost him.  i was panicked.
naw, you missed me, copper. try this on for size.
you don't have to tell me. it's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress. i just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
doesn't matter....
alright!  let's put it on film. camera!  sound!
i don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
i made no request to go out riding today.  how long has he been there?
forget it!
i can feel your desire, deanna.
we did what we had to do.
you're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
we are a pair, and that's what counts.
it wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  not a wit. do you know why?  because you're a man without scruples.
no, no.  she doesn't.
get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! don't fuckin' ignore me! you motherfucker!
okay.
the beast will kill her.
i don't want to learn.
you living together?
where is he, donald?
this isn't done.  get up.
you're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  we are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  that proves that --
i guess it does get a little hectic at times.
i wish.  you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission.
we could call for help.
oh ...  thank you very much, mother, but actually -
i don't know if i can.  but you have this... and you know where to come.
you may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely marie-louise.
coupons.
it's your play.
int. helicopter - day.
in time she'll be what you are.
so? do what everyone does. try like hell for renewal.
... what are they all doing there?
mmmmmmm.  mmmm, mmm.
i want to talk to both you guys about greta.  and...
leave him.
an intelligent plan, mr. luciano, but listen to me well. it can be ruined in a single careless moment. keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
i like that...
i know you very well, conor macleod. and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  mulet, romirez, they were fools without vision.  it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
all right, girls - from the top again.
all i wanna do is tell stories.  the things i find interesting...
i want him!
we're safe?
stan, it's chuck...chuck noland...
yes.
work, work, work.  virginia? when was that blizzard?
hello, sam, this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america.
not me.  i'm in for the long haul. in nine months i'll have enough to take a few years off.
i listened extremely carefully. nothing was even vaguely implied. he even laughed in your face when you asked him
not anymore.  now i'm the laziest damn cat burg--i'm going to take it so straight that i won't tape a mets game without the expressed written consent of the national baseball league.
aw, they've gone crazy. you can't reason with a mob.
jimmy.  everyone calls me jimmy the finn.
you don't wanna be noticed?
go on.
and on march 24, thomas sandefur, ceo of brown & williamson had you fired. and the reason he gave you?
notice? like what...?
we've certainly been in some swell jams.
tourists, about twenty of 'em.
hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like grandma. you're not gonna have an attack. okay?
knock it off will you, general?  crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
i'm not sure.
i think i broke my arm.
about jack? no. have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
i lived here all my life, i got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
what did i tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
don't start on me today.
you're exhausted.  let me get you a brandy.
i haven't given you much of a life.
come on, let's rock.
ripley?  you mean the wall street guy?
where is his home, lex luthor? which way?
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
that lunch was the worst, huh.
how could mitchell?  after that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
yes. it's ok, lynn. these are our friends.
so you can do an album cover?
they were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
today, a good girl.
give or take what, stern - how many - count them.
it's not only financial assistance. what he's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. it's not going to happen on the phone.
all right. i understand. fine. when he comes back, i won't get in the way.
yes. i really would.
who?
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only i wasn't sleeping.  would have slit our throats if i hadn't stopped him.
name five hundred.
right away i knew he didn't want them. i knew i was going to get stuck for the money. i only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. and now, he didn't want them. i didn't say a thing. jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
come closer then, jack, that i might give you proper thanks.
come on, scram! and stay away from that bus.
what doctor?
if we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. blow up right in our face.  ruby was just given a new trial.  if he has something to say, it'll be there. susie, what did you find out on oswald?
and what was the weather like at this time?
listen to me. the press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. and meantime i'm dealing with the stockholders in new york who are scared shitless -- and i'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. so you have got to trust that i'll do what i can to--
don't look at my ass!
what is it? where's casey?
... armed robbery ...
i cannot.
we'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
please do not be such a stranger. you'll stay the night as my guest. now, shu lien... tell me something. and forgive me for prying.  your father was a great friend to me, and i think of you as my own daughter.
but be reasonable. if i don't do something to stop her she'll try again. and maybe hurt you.
go away! leave me alone.
i don't expect to.
whattaya do there?
i don't...yes.  okay, the board.
it's important.
you know, she probably means well, after all...
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
how about inviting me over to dinner?
i'll get him.
don't you want to make one?
i want the number, idiot.  anyway, i'm at paul norman's and i'll try you later and if i don't see you at canal bar tomorrow night i'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
out.
the testimony will remain in the record. do you wish to cross-examine?
mine, too.
that's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
the spiders.
it was right there on top. isn't she pretty?
that's so long ago, i don't remember.
yes?
i'll take a bus.
you are a criminal.
no.
no, i don't.
just missed deleon.  hayes is up in the squad.
-- and i'm just too nervous around you right now.
yes and the old man used to come to my garden. he would read and rest there.
my only visits to rome, senator, have been through books.  but the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
why should we care?
you know how this gotta end.
i want us to go out.
quite a while. i took the scenic route.
commissioner gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
did my brother frank find out?
listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
he's black, ok?
i am. what do you want?
but you're not going to stop her?
it's not okay.  it's extortion.
you planning to do anything about it?
who's on the phone, now?  what do you mean... throw it on you?  you knew it, right?
they get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal.
asshole. but she won't miss anything, that. you'll see.
what do we do?    lean into it.
thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
he's gone!
which one is for the car?
great.	when can you do it?
you don't have to tell me anything.
are they still together?
his victories at charleston and camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  but he has a weakness.
spanish.  then i guess he's just real... real good.
you directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
what's the timer set for?
hugh, take care of the nekhorvich memory card.
cure!? ha-ha-ha!
sixteen next month.
it's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that, i--
look... you... take her and get the hell out of here. i'll keep 'em busy.
bruce, i know, but i was in the biggest jam --
don't ask.
maybe we should go now. you must be very tired. we'll call if any new -
sorry, i need everybody.
it doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
i'm nauseous.  oh, jesus, now i don't get to do the tv show?
it's never too late. give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  here. chewlies gum. try this.
a ride?. hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. hey, let's go.
nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
timmy, listen to dr. grant!
i should survive two days in palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
catchy.  you have any previous entertainment experience, miss diamond?
this place becomes famous. tour buses. blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. well of course, he's losing.
what chip?
kramer, i'm sorry.  all i was trying to do was--
i am not interested in what somebody else thinks. you being me facts and i'll act on them.
i never said that.
okay.  okay.  the <u>suitcase</u> bomb...
apone...where are your people? anybody in d-block?
i know what i got, max.  they put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
what?
goodnight.
sod.
but you've never figured out a way to win.
fine.  you?
an' you won't let nobody touch me?
yes.  that's true.  but...
how much do you make a week, niki?
no, no medicine!
yeah, for the last time, i hope. i'm done with this freak show. i'm moving back to the real world.
don?. are you in with them?
he tried.  it didn't take.
i have an idea.
marvin told me.  doom was after his land.  ne was afraid.  that's why he brought me his will.
washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
no, sir. of course, sir. good day, doctor.
victor did.
hawk?
is on its way ... the helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
have you heard?  the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee.
checking my pulse. it's elevated.  you enjoy frightening me, don't you?
romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! i conjure thee by rosaline's bright eyes, by her high forehead and her scarlet lip, by her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! o, romeo that she were an open ass, and thou a poperin pear! romeo, good night: i'll to my truckle-bed; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
oh, i'm awful tired. i couldn't go through another day like this.
i shall return.
so that's where you are. i might of known it. no wonder you couldn't hear me.
he'll live.
wonder what?
don't tell me what to do.
it's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
we forgot to stop at the store.
hey jennie. long time no see. what are you doing here?
but how're you going to explain this?  how did you get him out of the pool?
good to meet you.
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
i'll have to go to a new school -- again.
that's right.  our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
see!  see, i told you.
that's true!  but my grandfather, victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
i told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. like a scavenger hunt. she didn't know what that was neither.  no answer?
scottie, i need a friend!  someone i can trust! i'm in a panic about this!
but the thing is-i mean, since our discussions here, i feel i have a right to my own feelings. i think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, i really asserted myself.
where are your headquarters, rebel? tell me or i'll let you hang there forever...forever!
separate bathrooms, darling. i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
but, ted, the invitations have already gone out.
hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
it's terrible.
thanks. you are just a wonderful person.
i can't tell you.  you've got to see.
sir, that's not true! i love my country!
it don't work-
hey!
yeah, those are the guys that live. i really don't think death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, i think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
i'll tell you what... i think it's all you've got.
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago. as always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night?
yeah!  he'd kill for you dave.  he likes you.  your mind.
all right.
so what's the difference?
i'm not good in math.
i can't complain.
cocktail party.  uh huh, right.  let's saddle up.
yeah?  well, don't expect the toons to give you a gold watch.
you analyze everything out of existence. you analyze me out of existence. i won't let you. love is not so simple. ninotchka, ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? why do flowers open their petals? oh, ninotchka, ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
i need your help--
he talks loud. and he loves his code.
stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
damn! martin i'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  i thought maybe it would help. booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin, clearly relieved --
hmmmm.
yeah. it's pretty good.
no.  i'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
you'd know, of course.
what about?
well, this is a temperate zone.
chub says you're fired.
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
will this work?
it belongs to bob's uncle.
max, i'm scared.  are you sure?
this is his first night on earth.  he wants to close the door behind him. like all lieutenants, he covets command. there's a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back.  he has to destroy it.
get out? we had an arrangement.
pull up alongside.
did it work?
have you ever heard of the bible?
taking you for granite?
so why did you come here?
sure.
look, you don’t understand.  i woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
whu --
'no comment' means 'yes.'
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
fish can't feel.
oral hygiene?
you don't know me. you don't know me!  so fuck you. fuck you.
i'm completely stunned. i don't want this to happen.
you don't sew at all!
oh, i see.  but you're not luke. you're peter appleton, the picture writer.
yeah, robert del rio.
i was going to buy a slice.
i called from a payphone!
yeah, i'd say that's it.
go fuck yourself.
oh yeah.
maybe we should back off a bit.
ni!
well cheer, why don't you? no more responsibilities, mary. marcia -- elaine -- me -- all taken care of. down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
so?
did i ever tell you what tina wrote? the night she died?
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions.
listen. i've been in this dump for sixteen years and i haven't made a single convert...
ever had a romance with a crook?
is david dunne there?
if you love me so much, jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
yes, we'll be leaving soon.
i ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. i'm reaching' a point where i'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
well. once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
twelve hours, no big deal.  we should know something first thing in the morning.  don't worry.
look, we can put you in a mental institution.  we can make you look crazier'n marguerite oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
you little liar! get out of here!
i'm very sorry, ma'am.  i can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
you.
yeah.
there's more than a measly few grand in this.
what are you, drunk?
mine.
tomorrow night, i get off at eight.
like treacle.
hee-haw!
then tomorrow you will have the pages.
he owned the entire water supply for the city?
by the way, i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists. gift tokens. medical gift tokens.
i'm just not ready.
they think i'm insane. tell them i'm not, indy. please -- help me ...
what car?
he said he was an american agent.
no, thanks...
what am i gonna do for 24 hours? i can't even eat!
a small loan would be welcome. more urgently, i need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
are you mr. shakespeare?
larry, i don't know how to say this, but i think we got a shark problem. a real one.
mr. sulu, if you please.
probably the caffeine.
come on, baby-bear, open this door...
that's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
i'm okay.  look, it's a big house. we needn't disturb each other.  i can shoot a pistol!  i'll sleep in the stables.  i don't care where i sleep.  i don't sleep.
how is it this hag knows the truth?
hey, you know what? go fuck yourself.
you may call your next witness.
i know that you kill people to sell bodies.
that doesn't sound normal.
how is he?
thanks for getting me back in one piece.
wait'll you see it.
now go get molly.  your friends are going to be here any minute.
afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him -- love.
yes.
i don't.
... little bobby.
they'll be sorry. they'll be sorry. move out!
excellent. here they come.
it was you!  i thought i heard...
look i worked all day, i'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace!  is that asking too much?
save your breath. that line doesn't cut it with me.
wretched.  what happened to me?
that's no excuse for a morbid imagination. i caught him drawing this in class last week.  is there a problem at home?
pity.
i can't let you...
no, i don't think i am, susie.  anyone else?
oh ma, they're not using me. it's just a chance to travel, see things. besides, it's the only way i can get to new york.
bullshit.
tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon. listen, we've also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. i'd keep my eyes open if i were you, sam. bye.
jesus had nothing to do with it. if he'd been involved. he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
aren't you the lucky one...
not you. them.
she knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
you didn't tell anyone where you were?
don't you get it, gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley.  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen.
what happened to the power?
i'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all france. but -- on a happier note --
the truck's here. looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
you see anything in the crowd?  anybody suspicious?
tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
i'm not sure how to take that.
they're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
and what if you don't?
oh, man!
just keep goin'...
nah.
excuse me?
that's it?
have you talked to tom about it?
hey, smart ass, how 'bout i kick your butt?
you think that's wise?
i can't believe this is a coincidence, mr. cole.  have you been...following me?
you can do some crazy things with it.
i suppose.
oh, god, basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. how the fuck could you do that to yourself?
we're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged blair witch "sightings" --the parr house, coffin rock, tappy creek.
i'm proud of you, vincent.
man, i'd love to have your autograph, snake.
i might stop you.
i keep thinking about him.
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
it's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- i'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
follow him? mr. gekko i...  it's not what i do. i could lose my license. if the sec found out, i could go to jail. it's inside information, isn't it?
stop trying to play big brother. i'm a grown woman.  you gotta lotta nerve.  mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  come off it.
about what?
sure honey, what's the hurry?
those girls were asking questions. they've got it rough.  i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  i wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
yeah, you're a real hero.
i know i am.  i know!
if you'd been through what i have, you wouldn't --
it's the truth.  why won't you believe it?
just like any other hard cases. gotta know how to handle 'em.
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy.  maybe freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  someone to bring them to him.
burt, can you hear me now?
yes, mr. gardner.
that's what i'm saying.  we were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to jerry graff.
she'd say it to me when i picked on thomas or nathan.
oh, your kids are so adorable.
no again?
good.
hey!  would you?
oh.
did she?  you were pretty thick at one time.
is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? have you no human consideration?
wrong? why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. yes? he shakes alex's hair.
i asked you a question. do you love her?
i'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
we've been better.
well he can't have gone far.
to life.
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i'd just poured him. then i tried to deck the sucker.
be open with me. i'd like that.
but there it is!...
should i be expecting him anytime soon?
i don't want to see you anymore.
yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
there's something i think we need to talk about.
mr. d'amour?
you bring the best out in a man.
are you finished?  you okay?
tell me what she wore.
you've lost everything?
they left. i had to go with them.
this isn't like playin' winos on the street.  you gotta do more than outrun the guy.
except that he's also the chief defender of the faith.
not yet.
right from the start we didn't do it right. could you kneel down?
she was here first.
tatum!
i've never been given a fair shot.
did your wife find out?
not until like... eighth grade.
so we have two choices.  either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and i don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  we test again.  you're right, hugo, this was a desperate act.  someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  i'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
you're so spoiled. what is "not good" to you? only a few hundred --
no, i...
i gotta go to the bathroom.
of course not, my dear! i didn't come here with any such suspicion. how ridiculous!  nor did i come here to pick up his hat.
'night, al.
no...
yeah?
of course not! no one has the time to read! one glances at things, watches television...
hey man, that was a long time ago. don't let it get to you.
i will keep you safe. we are both older.
you're a very stubborn man, mr. valiant.  very pig-headed.  boys, show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station...
home--where he lives.
hey, i've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
are we hacking or asking?
sue ann hanson.
i want to know. we haven't talked this way in years.
stop talking. i'm trying to concentrate.
if we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
mike...?
fine, dennis.  soon as i get my money for this week.
leave him till we can get some help.  from now on, nobody comes down here.
yeah, i'll take some.
"bruce, harriet...fuck me, believe in yourself..."
it's just you.
this vulcan -- is he alive?
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers.
am not.
i've got one.
but bad judgement.  and now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
no. i take it you don't either?  how long?
james mccord.
be still ...
if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
about them kings. that the queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
i’m sorry. it’s just you don’t look local...
you're good.
that's correct.
again, i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders.!  what about you?
don't give up, parker. not ever.
see what?
i don't know, and i wasn't about to mess with it.
and with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, frank.
no.
it's somebody's idea of a joke.
yes... we can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the heart.
it's a trip, you know?  when you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
now that's scary!
enjoy it. say good-bye.
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas. you?
the torture of small children--
pleeeeeease!
i don't know.
brave?  to celebrate hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute? bravo.
you don't even know me. i want real respect.
does the pope shit in the woods?
the woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. words will flow like a river. i will see you in a week.
thank you.
that's the whole idea of living in the country.  i thrive on the seclusion.
i read that with a quantum increase of seven.
mydick. as in my dick. that was his screen name.
only for pee or poop.
comin' over coldwater.  goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  you believe that?
what do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
he must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. when the plane landed he was dead.
i could.
on my way...!
charming guy, basil.  once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but-
well, i'm a writer, actually.
yeah, i know--man made me memorize the whole damn army chain of command before he'd marry me. so this is a big deal, commander and  all?
yeah, like that.  same thing.
they were safe and could sleep.
roper...
do you want i send it to your room?
we know these people...!
when i was coming down here, i was playin' it. and "the night the lights went out in georgia" came on. now i ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, i heard it a million-trillion times. i'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time i ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed andy.
well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
you know - you know - you know what they're doin' to me?
you're sure mr. brandon won't mind?
you will not walk out on me
is this mr. black's fantasy?  another one of his whoppers?  aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? no one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
you wanna make a deal with me?
it's saturday.
yeah. right.  listen, "touch of evil"'s playing near my hotel. you wanna go check it out? watch charlton heston play a mexican?
it's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  if i take them, i spend the next day stupid as a stone. if i don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
nick. hey. how's things?
did you know he was going to be there last night?
is that why you joined the marines? for your father's sake?
that's not what i mean.  i've never done anything right.  i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it.  i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
that's very important to you, isn't it? home.
feel? i dunno... happy.
i dunno. somewhere in south america, i forget.
now i know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
what for?
get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
that's who you were, lenny. you don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. you're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
who is it?
what's that?
i'm the next one.
harold!
thank you for waking me.
ah, one of them's in the back.
you an indian?
who told you?
if i knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
that's exactly what i want you to do.
we don't have to help anybody.
do you want to take a session?
yeah, but everything's always in transition. if you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel autumn coming.  almost like bein' able... to see the future.
hey, you want something to eat ?
where?
no, dad, it isn't.
no. frank was a good bloke.
indeed, he has often told me.
your favourite dish.
me? grace? okay -- dear god --
easy morg, don't think about that now.
that's unique.
don't you believe in love at first sight?
this badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  it is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  it may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. but you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  it's a naked steel of the sword of justice.  put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
i always won.
...closed?
they say i'm a habitual hassler. like i fight some. sheeut. they didn't mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. that's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. but if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
ready when you are.
sir, i came from the chicago offices myself, and if i may say, sir, there are still some very good....
it's miller time!
tails.  that's ridiculous.
who's gonna to that?  japan is four thousand miles away.  so you guys just arrived, huh?
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too.
hollie was always fond of tide-pools. you know what he used to say about them?
you consider your life easy.
we've got to, brad, everyone's watching.
no sound at all?
you mean, while i'm here.
no. no, it don't. i can't do that. i can't let m'self. all i can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. they'd all get upset if i done anymore 'n that. they all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  that's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
good.
ha! i said "doll-hairs." psych! but a deal's a deal, my friend. in you go.
it better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
why do you have to bring that up? there's always risk -- life's a risk.  it's worth it.  besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  well, i think we've done enough for today.  you've been cooped up in there too long.  how about you and me go out on the town?  they're expecting us.
junior gave it to me.  it must have at least thirty stones -
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
yeah i know.  i did.
i don't know, airport i guess.
all right, scooby, let's not beat around the bush. with your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
now, sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
well, that's why you got it.
yeah, something like that, but as i say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
you want me to call the doctor?
well, actually, mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with the marriage guidance council.
chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
she'll never understand it.
so, how was the ride, kids?
this is the last chapter.  please, please give me clearance.  it's for science.
fuck this.
where are you right now?
poor baby..... here, bunny.
oh, well that's easy: i'm hot. you're...well, you're a little limp. sue's easy to see through.  and ben's always been a hardass.  why aren't you writing this down?
okay...
with them?
canelo!
think about your father. your sister.
that was so great what you just said.
she changed.
you haven't even heard from him?
but you're a superhero.
it's nothing!
fifty lire... 
it was c... i don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. why? you looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
i know what i wanted to know about keaton.
uh, no.  how do i get to beverly hills?
i got it. thank you.
i can't tell you the whole story. i. i took it upon myself. i can't say more.
what am i, a goddamn postman?  i'm way the fuck up here, i'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  put a stamp on it for chrissake!
i pray to god there is.
that's a pretty brassiere.
exactly.  what happened to your face? did jackie treehorn do that as well?
yes.  very.
sure, sure.
what?
on account of me.
you know lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. my attorney should have brought that our in court.
i already made you two tapes.
where are you from?
of trust. tell me your plan.
what about the dog?
what?
no, to be honest, i find it dull.
nothing serious.  a touch of stroke.
early 70's.  i was away.  maidstone.  possibly brixton.
hana, i know you do!
you would?
yeah... you said that last night.
just give me the keys.
amen. they cross themselves.
that's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a goddamn.
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
oh, sorry.
why not?
all right. what are you gonna do?
he drinks.
you know, i make the questions and he does the answers.
this food's delicious.  you're a wonderful cook.  and you have a lovely home.
as a matter of fact, i stopped by to tell you that i haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
i just can't believe it.
we put her in a safe house.
of course there is, jack. what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation? i don't think so...there has to be a grail.
artsy little village down seven.  there's a guy there who sells my work.  i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car...i saw norman sitting at this little cafe.
we have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
yes?
is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
<u>why</u>?!
if you say so.
yes i do. my family owns it. it's ours. you don't belong here.
no i quit.
how can you tell?
do you really not believe in god?
...that's fine.
come sunday morning:  my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
oh, you're going to make life very simple.
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
derrick coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas d.c. didn't want it bad enough.  delacroix, do you want it? bad enough to kill for it?  do you want it that much.
but it was you that gave nancy her strength.  so to get out he has to come through you.  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
i know him.  that's creek johnson.
how did you get here?
morning, neighbors. morning.
come to me, boy!
...yes, yes, yes....
in the bedroom. crying her eyes out because of you.
i do, actually; very much.
jim, maybe we should just go. i've got to look in on the kids. paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
longitude 109 --
yes.
lt. villiers and sgt. mcmanus are here to see you, doctor.
you feeling bad for jimmy? have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. those old boys in ciudad leon--
he told you, didn't he?
put me on the hailing frequency.
susan, dr. argon is giving you an opportunity here.
i'm glad.
thank you.  i wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
...deborah ann kaye...
right here.
thanks for dinner.  i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
what did you to do him, michael? why did he bite you?
wai...it's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  what did you say...?
but that's what you told your wife.
who's weak now, big brother?
right - for the first time this year.
bring him out of what?
i'd like to read it some time.
hey chief. bring my cup back.
take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  that little fuck untied himself anyway.
honey, i have to ask you this... is santos involved in any of this?
i've said this before. i think your the one who needs medical help.
what?!
<u>listen</u>!  we both got something out of it, all right!
i don't know what you've been saying.
was there?
not a prayer.
what did he do to arlene?
seven eighty-five out of twenty.  take care of yourself now, and don't do anything i wouldn't do.
but it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
yes, i remember you mentioning it. i got mine about the same time.
her name is jill.
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask.  your husband... he committed suicide?
nothing.  no mention of it.
tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
"security"?  what the hell you talkin' about?  your base isn't secure?
boy.
no. but one assumes obligations. my wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. her father's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it, i'd come back here. i've always liked it here.
don't be facetious darling. now drink your milk, you're late for college
you're wrong, dragonetti.
it makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the white house? each new member of the president's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon.
lesion, lesion in the temperal lobe. it's a kind of seizure disorder.
this here's a strike.
wussup, victor.
not yet.
am i right or what?
remember snoopy miller, his old pal from lompoc?
i'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
aw, shit...  i gotta pee anyway.
...thanks.
i didn't kill your wife.
this is bandit ii. now, where the hell are you?
where'd that come from?
i went myself to oversee the operation. didn't help much.
make it five.
nothing.
please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
no, spock. it means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
i don't know.
funny thing, you mentioning money. i was just about to ask your for some...
... you hate weddings, you never go.
let me see.
raise shields.
get it up!
what're you talkin' about?
yes, i am aware. how has your time in china been?
don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
his letters will keep.
billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
where'd you get it then?
that's genius, viktor.  was that simone's idea?
what is to become of me?  am i to wander the earth forever like a ghost?
so the method of death is the only connection?
no. no. i heard from superintendent zimmer this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our special needs class, he's bringing richard moffit himself to the thanksgiving day parade- check in hand.
i don't call this fun, pal. you're playing god with my body.
i have to talk to someone, mom.  i have to talk to you both.  and dad this time you got to give me an answer.
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
why'd you come to the house the other night?
shut up!  cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, i paid for your goddamn breakfast.
killin' 'em's the hard part. gettin' away with it's the easy part. whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? they couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. if you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
what urgent message?
i volunteered.
you're one of us, now -- aren't you?
don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
i don't know for sure.  ...i don't think so.
what?
after he moved out, i invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. he didn't show, not once.
well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. and so will you. it just didn't work out, walter.
is it all fugasi?
he's crazy.
investigator...
mother. i thought you were burglars.
you say 'fuck' a lot.
your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the national ticket.
first friday of the month?  linens. roll right off the trucks.  they're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  traffic will be smooth.
we all deserve to wear white.
oh yeah? can you think of something to charge me with?
incinerate it. like the others.
yeah.
the cabinets have to be redone --
you should. it's wonderful.
what?  they found what?
i had another one of you guys down here from frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  what's this about anyway?
there's so much i want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and i don't want her to misunderstand --
oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, i want to talk about you...
sure, rocky, bob's good for it...
you? dine and ditch, right?  over ten bucks?  you're probably looking at a thumb.
he's drunk.
i back rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, i'm not a politician...
i'm late.
i believe what he said.
they have a president. a benjamin yahoo something.
where's that coming from? i wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
at rest in the creative universe with mother, son.
especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
it’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
yeah, yeah, yeah.
satan's in this little fella tonight!
now, now, now!  it's all right, governor.
nancy's pretty good.
no, sir, those are... redbirds.
lighten up, ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
no, seriously - i know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  what do you think it is, dad?  jen says it's a moustache, i say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
what about crack?  you a user?
you're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
nah, i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... gimmee the nuke.
somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
just put your mask on.
you've got the wrong jones, mister donovan. why don't you try my father?
can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
i'm glad you like it.
a safe room.  an inner sanctum.  a castle keep, in medieval times.
but damn if he don't look like a fat old dragline.
sorry, son. i can't do it. you signed the 1240/a. it would be illegal.
as opposed to twenty angry women?
don't call me dear boy.
none facety, mistah.  you come for me?  dat's good news.
sorry?
good morning.
i guess so.
it certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
i'll page you.
are you detective williams?
we live in a theater?
this isn't an animal, vince.  i've been on this case four months, remember?  i've learned a few things.
i don't care, just get me there.
i said forget it!
you say a fortune. he never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
what's she talking about?
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
uh . . . no, man. i got some work to finish up here.
how do you like this couple, max?
the roller disco one.
what about death?
shhh...  yeah, yeah... no. no. i'll be there.  you gotta get me to the magic castle at four.
cal, you can't be serious! we're in the middle of an emergency and you --
jimmy!
i was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
what?
over there -- that's ricky tan.
this would be it?
i'd like to believe that i'm not... but i've just never seen any proof. so i just choose not to bother with it. it's, like, i could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. weighing the pros and cons. and in the end, i still wouldn't have any proof. so... i don't even debate it any more. because it's absurd.  i don't want to be alone.  so, does that make me, like, an atheist?
never mind that, where are we now.
i don't want to talk about it here, brad.
'cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
you're right -- i am a coward.
our little paradise -- just made for two?
a man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
well a little business too.  in my upcoming project star trackers i play a ship's captain, and i really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  i feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
i don't know.  there's a lot of space up here.  they could be just about--
then your father's a wimp.
it's kind of embarrassing but,
what d'ya mean "what monster?' you remember...the one we madein the basement.
i'm always all business.
i don't know.
how?  supportive letters from prison while i'm being kicked out of our home?  do you have any idea what is happening out here?  our credit cards are maxed. the people at the bank, you should see their faces when i walk in there. i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  nobody will help us.  nobody will take us in.  nobody wants anything to do with us.  so tell me, carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
and you think i don't want those things?  you think i don't stay up half the night wondering if i've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what i'm giving up for it everyday?  let's get married.
i'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— what more do you want?
so everything. that's so what. so i begin to hate him. so i want to do him grave harm.
no. but does it make any difference?  how did you get to be the way you are?
good.  but "love your enemies"... body and soul.
ohhh... jolly good. perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
shut up.  i'm playing.  oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  but it's all so easy--just try a little tenderness...
no chinese man discovered electricity.
do i look like that kinda girl?  i lost my room this morning.  i don't know where i'm gonna sleep tonight, but i keep going.  what the hell else can i do?  i've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, i'll always have a job.
i can understand his position. he went through a lot with lydia after his father died. he didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
he was watching you.
john, don't be mad! don't be mad! i was just playing with it! i didn't tell no one!
i'm feeling better.
i ought to have you whipped from this fort!
i guess so.
i'd like to eat something before i go back to work.
he has a lot of hurt inside him.
who's in it?
what?
that would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since andrew died.
stepmother's...
the manzetti thing must have scared her. she thinks she'll get implicated.
yes.  we can pray.
tell iris all about it.  take good care of mrs. finley, iris.  beckett, come in.
how are you?
you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she'll be back. god wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
don't tell me...merchant banking?
this is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
are you an fbi man?
did you do it?
give me one more day, sir. the damage control is easy. reading klingon is hard.
you sleeping all right in that house?
are you recording it?
i'm just playing around.
no.
i don't know, bob. what about one of those?
i don't have any real destination. i'm just going south.
this isn't mr. goodman's idea. he is your good friend, whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
what'd he say?
well, this pate is rather...unusual.
the amulet...
i know.  you're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
you know i wasn't drunk--i knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car--
but it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. michael...?
and you, sir? any better?
well that's good. i'm happy to hear it.
inconceivable!
<u>lure</u> him. 
but captain, i mean -- cannibals.
apparently, mr. wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. she said he would like it if i wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "american."
western hemisphere... north american continent...
no, mr. roma.  i don't need the time, i've made a lot of investments in the last...
ya catch any fish?
you see the couple up in the balcony?
maybe it was just a dream. ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
twenty-four isn't young.  i'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  i've never been with anybody but darryl.
i'll be dammed.
no.
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
you okay?
you remember when i asked you about pornography --
does he?
huh! you understand how i feel. how long was it we had, honey?
i must've touched something.  this happens all the time. it must be my fault.  machines hate me.
i didn't know... i didn't...  it was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... i...
whatever it is, it's dark.
good night. 
it'll be tight, but we should make it.
me? no. no, i guess not.
no.
in and out of bed.
don't worry - is that my hammer  well just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
c'mon, beth.  don't make this personal.  he told me himself they were taking us back.
so what about him?
mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
i don't feel so well. have you seen telly anywhere?
do you know where danang is?
a little.
i feel sure of it.
if the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
come, come. you don't really expect me to fall for --
i had him out this morning.
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
no? give me a chance, baby. money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
scouting?
abc telemarketing company.
he ain't never known me, lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
yes.  we have lots of big men chasing us.
of course.
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.
sleep well?
don't mind him, chucky.  you're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline.
i'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
no. there's nothing new.
not tonight, louis. no more rest.
calm down, frances.
oh god.
yeah, i haven't really absorbed that one.
sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me?
i was an indian, actually. man, that damn psycho paint...! if that's supposed to be mild, i don't want to know about medium.  the planet earth. it's good to be back.
you're in breach.
if a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
what will they tell you?
who's brumby?
emotion tricks all of us, mrs. rand.  and you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  that conscience has been tormenting you. the rest is coincidence.  there is no such thing as a zombie.  the dead do not come back to life. death is final.
do you believe that?
no zydowski i didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
no, i'm sorry, darling, i told you i won't be home for a few days.
congratulations on the deal.  how exciting.  is sally doing sally?  i mean it's sally.  the character that's based on sally.  the character that's based on sally in the book.
a passionfruit smoothee.
you prep the gravity couches. i'm going to manually arm those explosives.
hey. i'm a short guy. waddaya want?
there's some maple walnut in the freezer.
the blood tide. our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. there's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. i've discovered a way to invoke it.
thanks. so...  what do you want to do?
stronger, yes. smarter, definitely. but you have something he doesn't have.
yes. it was very good to see her.
are you jackin' with me?
can you project its course?
just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
string that bluebeard up to a pole!
i hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
i'm tired.  really.  i should get home.
a hunch.  he might be able to...
i hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
swimming. swimming is good.
you want to help sick people for the rest of your life? god forbid i should talk you out of it.
i'll need a receipt for that.  for all these.
it's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
well.
fear and ignorance.
you're no stranger to rape, marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. you courted. you begged.
you bullshittin' me?
i'm not. no. but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
hm?
how could i forget about you?  you're the only person i know.
i missed...
you missed a very dull tv show about auschwitz.  more gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
claire...
that was <u>especially</u> monkeybone. come on, doc, i don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. i just want to be <u>us</u>. home. alone! <i></i> i have something i have to give you.
ask him.
i could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
okay, artoo, let him have it. now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
things change.
that'd be me, sir.  frank baker. this is my brother jack.
i don't like that, either, it's worse than waski. i want to be called fran.
you're driving me crazy!  do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
in what way?
i'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
dead astern! zig-zag!
nick, vince, albert and john.
yeah and he doesn't know when --
i see.
you weren't there, you don't know what happened.
where are we going to sleep?
yes sir.
yeah.  i heard you.
to do what?
alderman.
anytime.
why does everybody say that? he's the only person i know who doesn't need to use me.
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  you too, bill, even if you're family.  he's a big shot businessman.  i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots.  a fag, you know.  goes by another name down here.
if he was so good why's he so dead?
that depends on what they see.
second generation, huh?
i'm serious.  i'm always going on about me, me, me.  enough about me.  your turn.
can you get us in there, past security?
oui, doctor, oui.
very well. if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
you're talking like a drunk.
you don't read, do you?
what?
a hot shot, huh?
no fucking way.
son, don't --
it don't matter!
i'm worried about all of us.  i can't figure out what they're up to.
please don't follow me.  don't do it!
exactly three weeks to the day.
nah. i'll probably just be here studying for finals. the joys of summer school...  are you okay?
yes it is. will and seamus look at each other -
i don't know. i've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? unless you're tired of talking about it.
take your hand out of there. slowly.
look, i'll call harvey tomes in the psych department, see what i can find out.
well, i'll see what i can do about it.
rafe... no.  you forgive me.
what, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
he says so many fiancées.
mr. fettes and i have professional matters to discuss.
enough.
i know you are.  go you huskies.
no need to thank me, if you don't want to.  just pay for these drinks.
we don't have proof of that.
ahhh...
bet your sweet ass we are.
chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
you're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
this evenin' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight.
no, i want the nsa to get caught spying on albert.
i think she's pretty, mommy.
sure, he's "the bodhisattva".
c'mon.  it's not that bad
a barbaric yawp.
but i'm the one up there on the screen.
the tv didn't work.
i guess not...
that is correct.  lieutenant dunbar, i came to apologize for the accommodations. ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
same. none of the neighbors know. we told them you were in a hospital in europe.  oh... this is stanley davis. he's the american consul here... and necdit yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
when's the next business trip, big fella?
your royal highness.  what a pleasure to see you here.
to the airlift.
news, last night... those guys, the ex-presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  and i was just there the day before, cashing a check.  see... look.  assured trust... same place.
he makes all his money off us black people and i don't see nuthin' but italians all up in there, sylvester stallone and motherfuckers.  ya see what i'm saying, homeboy?
"you're playing a dangerous game here. if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
what else did he get?
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
tumescent!
what is it?
i ain't his partner, i'm a tourist.  i got proof.  see, i got a mini-bar key.
what's wrong, jimmy? tell me what's wrong --
suit up.
i used to helm a school ship.  a long time ago.
vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
no. hey -- he knows that you been creating now you're gonna get a beating
put in one of your fixes. walt knows he's loused himself with the church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
she'll be all right baby.
i'm not going to hurt you.
it's an inside job. that's a cinch. whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. now brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
the man knew how to dress.
we're pushing oxygen today.
well, we're veering into classified info here, but i'll tell you that it involved a donor.  he was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
are we?
i couldn't sleep... i should get going; i feel really weird...
he said that father's in town. he's been seeing julia right along.
hey, man. jeff. how're you doin?
-- i pose you the same question --
yes they are, aren't they?  look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
i am jack's complete lack of surprise.
not at all.
and how did you breach the barrier?
freddie, do you have something to say?
instead of friday -- could you possibly switch to thursday? you'd be doing me a great favor --
it's ellie's cat.
about an hour and a half on the freeway. or two if you take the coast highway.
what was the earliest it could have been cashed?
certainly, mister mcmurphy, with pleasure.
i certainly was not!
mmph?  where am i?
you're livin' in edina, then?
well, that's blunt!
cut to the fucking chase, flynne.
i don't know.
i'm saying i didn't sign it!
i'm talking to you as a friend now. don't ruin your life, your career for her.  she'll spit you out when this is over.
sikh.  if he wears a turban, he's a sikh.
then why are you teaching me...?
where? [beat] it's becker isn't it? he's doing stuff, isn't he?
it's sue ann rogers, betty sizemore's friend? i heard from her.
shhh! shhh!
hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
alex, i think it's time for you to stop.
i'm a greek, thank you.  and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians.  give our new colleague some of the cretan white.  relax, tell me everything, i'm your friend.
oh, hi.
of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. he's got everything and you've got nothing.
those checks take forever.
i'll hack the gibson.
she remembers because it was her "dream truck."  wanted one just like it.
what on earth gave you that idea?
right. and you-and you know what the beauty part is?
i don't know. that's just how it sounded. well, i'll see you.
it usually is.
it's not that... it's not that...
yeah, but the untouchables took down capone. heller got shot and killed. the bad guys beat him. worse, sparazza walked.
usually they take clothes.
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century.
"turn you out?"

no...
we encoded four minutes --

your mother tells you this?... agnes your mother is dead.
talk to him, bruce.  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
boys like the one you met today are surplus. commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. we improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. is that too hard for you?

i reckon it's been ordained this way, brother spoon.
curiously it appears to emanate from us.
that's it, we're empty ma'am !
glenn?  no, i don't know any glenn.
i don't know, i never met your father.
are you kidding, it looks great. you wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. but you can go out dancing in this too. it's a total power suit.
that's what i was gonna ask you.
you're married!  you've already got a husband!
yes.
i'm sorry, about this...

we have no choice but to continue as planned.  deploy the sentinels. immediately.
hey.
no. that's all. you made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
no, but it got you interested, didn't it? got you to dig. inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
on a train. he said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
c'mon, rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
you know where my loyalties lie.
maybe. maybe just.
the soviets are in control of the sams. it's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.

no.
what do we do?
i'm aware.
right on. you know what? he doesn't need the limo, man.

i been here with him eight years now. he built it when he was with leora.
oh, jack...
i'll drink to that.
going back  - to the jungle to die.
like all that juliet of the spirits or satyricon, i found it incredibly... indulgent. you know, he really is. he's one of the most indulgent film makers. he really is-
but then came an angel who whispered these words
ah, now, that's better.
yes.
shutup! -- and don't think i haven't noticed how you've changed. i used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest i thought you were an imbecile --
s'pose you've never thought of killing him--

i'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police?

records are those big round black things, right?
i see that.
a medical team will be standing by.

if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. that would have left us with nothing.
i suppose i can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
because the assigned curriculum is boring.
i'll know you've lied to me... all along. i'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
i think everything's ready.
you -- covered in my vomit.
i don't know... i was thinking maybe i should live alone. i decided to rent that place we looked at. i'm moving in next week.

you stupid bastard!
yes and so do i, but there are too few of us here to carry it. too - heavy

but han and leia will surely die.
agatha...
peter criss is my inspiration, man. if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo, i'd consider it... money... hey, how'd you know that?
yeah.
we blew it, edgar!  we lost it!

why don't you return this car and borrow mine? have debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
saturday!  well they'll have to reschedule.
the thing is...it really can't wait.
no. it happened when graham went to see hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. she saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. she was connected up to a voice box.  when graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'why did you have to kill my daddy?'  that's when graham had his nervous breakdown.
...yah, well, you stay away from scotty now -
it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  most homo sapiens didn't make it...danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
how about your phone number?
maybe hawaii.
just do what i say, alright?
what the hell is this?  who are you?
is it? i forget. i don't call myself that often.
she said what you said she'd say.
i believe they will deport you.
well, you're the lawyer. 
he's terribly busy, sir.
chekov's on reliant, isn't he?
grandpa does not own a t.v.  have you noticed?  there's no t.v. santa carla has no malls, no cineplexes and now i won't even have mtv.  i will not know anything hip happening anymore.
you got any whiskey? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. that's why i do not eat over there now.
who's up for making some real money?
you can see well in the dark, rowan.
what difference does it make where she comes from?
where are you going?
a good deal, like this with us, for burnett will be good only temporarily.  he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  life is dust, make it while you can.  he's ambitious.
of course woody ain't worried! he's been andy's favorite since kindergarten!
come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
he's getting middled, too.  and derek's our partner.  what's good for us is good for him.
and jus when my baby's out on some texas road with a killer.
what?
yes. i'm impressed.
how soon can i get a plane to seattle?
i broke up with my roommate -- he was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
i heard that.
no.  don't say anything.  don't do anything, and for christ's sake, don't apologize!
three minutes to go!
really? care to make a wager on that?
big business. i could work with that faction quite nicely, colonel novogrod.
with tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
alonzo...
history, leonard.  <u>history</u>. everything else is conversation...  how's the other matter?
yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
it's okay. they're prescription.  works better with a little whiskey.
calm down, bud.
that you, talley?
which one?
oh, you're welcome. nice to finally meet you, jeffrey.
not tiger woods.
someone actually... employs you?
you can't do this!! have you ever had cheesy poofs? they're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
oh, you're right, beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
you think this is funny?
you should have stayed in bed this morning.
we're getting married.
and you're working with him?
are we gonna do business here, or not?
women... nothing surprises me, chip. excepting your late mother... who even knew selina had a brain to damage?  bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  meanwhile i got badder fish to fry.  yeah -- oswald, please.
we must abandon.
no, there. there's a good one. do you like that?
no.  no.  well, sort of.  in my heart. been dead 29 years.
bullshit.  you told me i'd get half a million dollars.  you told me i'd be set.
she's driving me fuckin' crazy.
what is his room number?
it's still bleeding a little. here, let me put this on.
i never saw this girl in my life.  is this a kind of joke?
he's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon.
now, hold on.
it's everywhere. but water is always the door.
you miss?  well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
you're very protective of him, randal. you always have been.
what's wrong with me?
yes... a very slim one. i want to be fair. i don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
too many pizzerias already there.
yes.
strudel, this is herr mozart. say good morning.
no.
a man eater! fantastic!  making history, herb
you knew the subject thomas grunemann. how well?
i think i'll...carry him.
you writin' a book or somethin'?
well, i don't know....
well--how do you do, m'sieu laval?
so, that's it. i'm out?
no thank you.
there is no lid! nothing's going on between sam and me. coulson. mr. sam coulson and me.
thank you for saying that, but no. my business.
peaches.
a dead one.
remember he's left-handed.
i don't drink coffee, daddy. and this is not what we should be talking about.
first place, you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio.  now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
look at this! 
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca-cola again.
there's another reason?  it better be good.
that's none of your fucking business.
it's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
i think it be a better idea if you and thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
and that's why you're losing your bet?
that's too easy for lennon.
it wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
look! don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
i'm too tired for this. let's just go.
what, and i care? remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
good coloring.
security.
they need help. jaime, anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
it's ours, indy. yours and mine.
hundredth cabinet meeting.  i thought it was a nice touch.
you don't know.
order!
no! what gave you that idea?
and are they going to get it?
the tank will be finished by morning...
though nicer than most?
val, stop!  they're coming!  don't move!
oh yeah, he's good.
don't worry, doc, it's not your problem. you don't have to mix up in this.
he is?
oh, i couldn't eat nothing. my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
i think maybe you'd better. and connell—i'd like to have the john doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter miss mitchell wrote, for which i gave her a thousand dollars.
maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
not me.
you don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  if it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a continuing criminal enterprise.
check this out, he's from russia.
don't let's take any chances.
yes. i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place.
when i get home i shall probably be knighted for it.
you don't know shit!
really? you see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. there should be, like, a line behind you.
aren't you being rather arbitrary?
leland leave her alone... she doesn't like that. stop it.
d'artagnan...
you want to go through those?  i'm taking them to the thrift shop. it's marcia vaughn's pet charity. pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
any planets?
to tell the truth, ever since i found my natural callin' i done time in so many small-time jails i could write a brochure...
an occupational hazard, i'm afraid.
why, honey --
m-e...
thank you.
but you didn't do much about it, susie.  you walked out, and there i was...solo...and not too good at that.
yes. it does.
don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
i know you can.  but i'd like to.
you're not going anywhere. you hear me? i'm still your father.
well, no...
so what are you saying?
it's a living.
aren't you supposed to be buried in new york someplace?
--anna--
you and me are checking the other ways in and out.
how fascinating. do go on ...  ... john.
not yet. i want to study its habits.
serafine? is that you? what's going on?
i think i'm way ahead of them.
i hope i didn't disturb you.
look, miss weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. here's my card. i'm always there.
i guess i have. you were pretty little when they locked him up. i don't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months.
no, nothing.
it's gonna be close. real close.
christ, stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
oh you know.  no doubts.  no second thoughts.  am i a monster?
<u>shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
<u>were</u> you, sir?  can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
oh, yes... well, doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
in my youth, partner.  in my youth.
sorry, honey!  i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
louis, you're a life saver.
julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. you're projecting your anger onto us.
wrong number.
no, actually i feel worse.
that's their standard deal, brother. they ain't about to change it for us.
because i like to torture you.
mr decker....
you mean -- you and me? i thought you were taking the branch manager from kansas city --
i'm...inside you.
very well.
chick was outright killed by a mob. he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
her name's lorelei ambrosia. she's webster's girl friday.
they knew the risks when they signed on. i've come too far to turn back now.
yeah...
he's not gonna stop, satch.  he's gonna keep on...
let's do it.
i could get promoted right out of here.
because it's evil!!
noted. thank you.  miss costello was a rebuttal witness. her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
gotta run. shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
leave us alone right now.
fake it.
oh yeah.
then why go there?
be careful, for chrissake.
how did they manage to do that without any communication?
i think the only way to help ourselves, claudia, is for us to be together.
maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising.
oh, no. nothing's wrong. everything's fine!  so there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the john does, eh?  you forgot one detail, mr. big shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the john doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
my dad had to help me pack. suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. it was sweet, but it took forever. anyway, i guess i'm ready to go.
can i undress and talk at the same time?
i've just been so busy, lisa.
it's better than ice cream.
deal.
yeah.
i'll get to it right away, mr. rawlston.
no. that's the last thing i'll do. you never asked what happened.
i’m not worried, mom. he’s still learning our ways...
mangoes? there as a fucking tiger in the woods -- i could've been eaten alive. i'm never going into that jungle again. i gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
no.
you take a lot for granted.
we'd go to his car.
says he can't walk.
-- leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard. he came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy. he tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. he started running for the open grass. with the car moving, jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed leo's spine. leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. and some chicken feed. stale chicken feed with four days mold.  electromagnetic printing.
what? a swallow carrying a coconut?
everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. annie.
didn't know you cared so much.
go on...
mmmmmmmmm!
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  she has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  we have been paid to look the other way.  i came in here to take your money.   i brought snapshots to show you. so i could get your money.   i can't take it.  if i take it. if i take that money i'm lost. i'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    i can't do it. i can't take it.
-- the inside?
i don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
i'm not afraid. i'm just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
what happened? oh, i'm sorry, it's none of my business.
don't blame yourself. in your shoes, i don't think i would have told parker, either.  so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality?
never mind -- i'll get it. i have a whole day. i'll be on that train.
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
leave me alone -- !
thank you for keeping me informed.
i guess that's a no.
three words, dear romeo, and good night indeed. if that thy bent of love be honourable, thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, by one that i'll procure to come to thee, where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; and all my fortunes at thy foot i'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world.
oh, thx... hold me, hold me, thx holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  they kiss, and luh hides her head in thx's chest.
she's entering deep sleep now. heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. all normal. she could dream at any time now.  right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. waiting to see what shows up.
it's possible.
well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
just...say...no!
physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
your time is up, busyboy.
i can't hide anymore.  i breathe like a dog.  i lose my balance.  stealing's got harder. caravaggio stares at the herodotus.
i'd better get you down.
why? it is a wrestling match, or…
some other time, george.
jesus, my legs are asleep. i'll never be able to win this shit.
you haven't even looked at them once.
next time i'll use valet parking.
tell me one thing.
can i ask you a question?
no thanks.
very pleased to meet you.
how do you know all this?
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  you'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  we'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  one more question.  i see a big hole.  if this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo. i guess to get me running. did you tell her about my stash?
she didn't tell you why she was upset?
she was a nurse.  she must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  there must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for wyoming.
well we're glad to have you, marjorie. you can call me chase, by the way.
he means they're thieving dogs.
nothing.
where is the film crew from the british museum?
they'll probably move at dawn.
no! letters. i've got to write to the rangers and ma--and--i'm bustin' with news! why, i've introduced a bill! me--jeff smith. i got up and talked in the senate! 
half their air force is our stuff. captured.
gwen...
we have to stop meeting like this.
did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
where is he? where's j.d.?
maybe he...
you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
not yet.
hasn't been another call, has there?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
under him?
creature? a... human like creature?
so?
what’s in it for me? where are my mary janes?
tell him i want to give him his money.
we've had a real hard life, too, mama.
hey, be fuckin' nice. calm. be nice. don't fuck up in here.
'cause you're a jag-off. i would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
what can i do?  tell me what to do.
my mother has always loved me.  she would do anything for me.
he wanted a job, he's got one.  i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
glass?
how?
quite the little eccentric.
because i love you...
i mean, i suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
and have you mended them?
you told me to.
is that what you gave him?
i don't know.  but you do.
i have a passport.  i've got...  actually, it's a little complicated.
i told him about your car.
what did you guys think?
she's not! but if she was it would be that little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
the poem! i knew he liked the poem!  billy prince is asking me to the prom.
yes, sir...troop's about ten miles back...the colonel sent me looking for you...
it's ten after nine.
you won't die, rose.
this is stargher we're talking about?
yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "maverick!"
i can't let my lunch hour go on too long. i've already skipped one meeting.
you're blind, dude. blind.
mary robert, i am so sorry about last night...
he's cooking guinea fowl?
i'm leaving you jake.
oh yeah?
sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
... blind as a tiberian bat. what do you make of the plantoid beyond?
come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
roger, one.  rolling.
i'd build a house.
i'm an open target, dan.  if you're with me --
..not in time to save him.
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street.
what?
you think he's not good enough for her?  you're right.  if she was my mother, i'd send her home right now.
i had to inspect the merchandise first.
i'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
they got him!  wait a minute -- hold the wire.  they got earl williams surrounded -- the riot squad has -- in his house.
yes.
a very wise suggestion, leon. i'm afraid madame and i will never agree.  the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. i understand everything will be over by thursday. am i right?
no it's not.
-- can i get you?
we couldn't have done it better ourselves.
ask whatever you will.
well shit, then, let's fuck.
calm down, bear...
go  that's the way we're going to go.  what do you say?
that's right.
one more night --
if nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. butterflies. old china. penny farthings. a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
on clark street!
fletch f. fletch
shhh!
absolutely.
that's very enlightened, professor. it's comforting to know that america's children have you for a teacher.
i don't know. how much do you want?
nothing.
the name's gordon. bert gordon.
never better. you sleep well.
certainly not.
and get me the fad king.  no.  get him first...  we don't need an act two?
yeah, but i don't like it.
i was gonna give you the money. probably i was. shit, i don't know, i don't know anything anymore.
never.
true.
there are lots of reason... i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might...
when your ready son!
we have a deal worked out with irvine.
what if i petitioned one of the directors?
no.
nope.  darrell.
we neutralized anybody with a voice. leo, jimmy... eagle bear. anyone who was standing in the way of the land. is that it?
you can't tell.
can't you get contacts?
i think you oughta cut a...
to the place where death lives.
and a lot more. can we talk?
and howls alison?
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
shelby, shut up. keep an eye out for these things. if you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. otherwise they'll go straight down it. all right?
it's going to sonora.
honey.
put your eyeballs back in your head, william randolph. i'm on assignment. a girl has to fit in.
well, i don't pretend to be an expert.
oh no, hannah!
but there's no more drug.
sure.  they want me back in so i won't break in!  they <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
good.
oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
...i've never been in a man's apartment before.
do people die in italian operas? gentlemen, if all goes to plan nuclear man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce superman's skin. he'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
you actually sold insurance!
where up north?
poppea.  she was his wife.  and she was unfaithful to him.  so he got mad and he jumped on her.  up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  please don't jump on me.
in a way.
that's what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.
thousands of people did die, just different people.
-- confirming everything we already know --
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
yes.
what?
i need a ticket.
what about this?
you don't work there anymore, bobby.
dad, you're bleeding...
for your wife?
this has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
truth is i usually get along better with animals than with people. in nepal the villagers call me 'kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
and put it on expenses?
no, you listen, you little bitch. if you hang up on me again i'll gut you like a fish. understand?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
but they are not ny people. you look at me as if i am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq, did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces you will never see? did you cry for their wives and children. they were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
you said, "will it change..." wife. will it change...
hmm.  those sound kind of small.  oh, here's one that looks good: janet lawton.  i'd sure like to play her.
yes.
give this to joey, will you?
the sats, knucklehead. scooby i'm not taking them.
what kind of treasury dept. business is this?
your first boyfriend. what do you think? any sparks left?
thank you, mr. dobisch.
you mean countries that are acknowledged by the un...or like made up countires too?
right in my face. you looked in my face and you lied.
you did?
i can be quick.  i can even be funny.
it's what we're here for, ain't it?
i'm not gonna debate you, jerry.
did you throw away those fries, hamilton?
no, please.
what that?
that's perfectly clear.
had some good years.  met her in '66.  she showed up one day in coldfoot.  no one knew her.  one sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  my bid was eight thousand dollars.  beautiful girl.
a smaller bowl of flowers.
what happened to kurtzweil?
and it's the ninth inning.
yeah.  no, not really.
that's my job.
do i know hans hinkel?
i know. i have acrophobia. what a disease. a fear of heights. and what a moment to find out i had it.
animals kill only from hunger or fear. the man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
what do you mean no i won't? don't presume to tell me what i will and will not do. you don't know me.
holidays are our busiest days.  no one likes to be alone on holidays. i know i don't.
i put on the lotion you got me. can you smell it?
i told you. i got drunk.
i'll miss you too, honey --
what about the club ... ?
let's not get excited, sir.
but your father--he runs stuff, he--
okay.
then so be it. if you believe what that indian said we were fucked either way.
what hideous sin have you committed lately?
answer them and quit kicking me!
yeah.  what's that?
but, reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style.
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. a razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. but underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
what!
you know why.  you already said.
jim stark.
some of his solo stuff's not bad.
... you look beautiful.
listen alan, i really appreciate you bringing me along.
you cannot be real, conor.  you had the last rites.  no man has been cut half as bad and lived.
i told you - my manager was a total asshole! don't worry, i'm going to get another job... and anyway, i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
you do.
did you ever hear of "the lone rider of santa fe?"
that's a ford, not a ferrari.  you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?
oh, "starry night" time, huh?
it's where he hides out.  inside.  that's how he found me.
well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
what'd i say?  what? what? what? what?
this in intense.  get a grip, john.  okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... i figured that part out for myself.  so what's the deal?
this is your great invention?  would you wear those things?
shut up.
i think i'll have a coffee.
that's...
but...
goddamit, give me my tape, then.
... mmm-hmmm.
all right. all right --  john, just sit tight will you? i'll read your report, i'll discuss it with the others. i'll be back next thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. nothing til thursday, all right?
that is a <u>nasty</u> story!
what!
they never wrote you nothing?
are you kidding?
me?  wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
want a list?
don't worry.  she's just a fan for my literary output.
i'm not. i'm not. i'm just look -- you know, in a way, it's good. he got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
`the most interesting thing about elliot litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  i'm telling you as a friend.
okay by me.
"and a slash-slash there --"
try joshua strader, will ya, darlin'?
but nobody wants to see that. it’ll never go. they’ll rewrite you. you don’t want that.
thank you, mr. president.
if it's not asking too much --  for our information just for illustration  tell us how you intend to run the nation.
that's my answer.
can i have your name please?
you haven't answered my question.
i've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late.
she called you brad?
till it's in a powder.  the energy exits within you...
all right, but remember, if you damage the fuhrer's reputation, i kill you.
i'm sorry. it's just... i'm under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and i work all day, i come home, i look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
listen, did you want to make love?
we have hunted since childhood.
you could take it--
i picked them out for you, jake.  i thought you would like the colors.
i didn't make my move fast enough. that's it, isn't it?  i was too respectful.
one of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
sweet princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
if you can catch him.
darling, i was busy looking out for your interests.
shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. say here's to your fuck frank.
a few rabbits, but i think one of them was already dead.
the ledge, i know it well, or should i say <u>we</u> know it well.
i was afraid of this.
well, then, how could he write that roast?  the notices in the kane papers were always very kind to her.
you have sixty seconds... here's the question...  which one of you is frances?
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
you been working?
gee, i'd like to get inside and see how it works. what do you think makes it go?
well, let's help them with that. take the legs.
pardon me, doctor, i am hearing many calls of distress.
give me the phone.
but where's the damage?
precog deja vu...
where was the last place you left him?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again.
you're the only one left alive...
the shi'ites are on our side?  i didn't know that.
bartholomew?
no, i'm sure.
-- eddie told you?
am i getting warm?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of archangel de jesus montoya?
i'm sorry, sir, but i must insist.
i'm trying.
what should i do?
mission district.  gonna find us an indian.
don't thank me.
what makes you so high and mighty? did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. you don't get eyes like that from...
sustained.  your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
just move!
for what? for seeking the truth?
ian?
okay, just ask yourself.  what do women really want?  you take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  stuck in a rut.  they need some release.  the promise of adventure.  a hint of danger.  i create that for them.
shhh. now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
love a cup of tea. with lemon.
what has it got me, your union?
it's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
yes.
some other time jimmy, i'm beat.
because it feels really incredibly good.
what good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
i didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
'allo.  whoo is eet?
rob. please focus.
not until trading places in '83. jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies. she didn't show her tits until she went legit.
it's just the dope, don't worry
we're here for the week. i'm shooting in osaka for a few days.
i've got something for you.
it's only a tale.
now hold on. i'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but i don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
what are you up to, eh, savieer? i mean, not this but... money, passports, a gun in a microwave? who are you, eh? who are you?
it'll cost you.
eh, no.
about what!
don't be. i'm not. it's good money.  'side, he's worth it.
i think i'm going to stay up for a while.
you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
that's disrespectful.
honestly ... no.
what for?
marty...
i don't know.
it's gonna get cold.
alright!
oh. oh!
are you an artist?
tired of this shit...
twenty bucks.
bastards.  let's get some shots.
mr. mitchell.
no, this is just the second unit. we'll do the main footage later.
yeah, and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow.  tough break.
only six?
then stay...
you could've killed him, you know. you could've killed the joker.
oh, that's not me.  it's just that once in a while, i have some people in for a drink.
sure, i found him. then last night i had a little trouble. somebody tried to slit my throat.
what in god's name...?
be careful. you're in it now. and it's gonna get mean.
why don't you shut up!
guess you gotta go.
i'll bet.
no.  i'm going to be on that boat with sugar.
which may explain his temperament. to have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
why are you asking all of a sudden?
the soho grand?
that's right.
you're brill.
i feel pretty.
sure, mack...
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. a unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
maybe you saw mary!
sounds fine.  i'll need to meet everybody.
david!
because you're looking for the holy grail.
where is she?
you wouldn't shoot me, would you?
it's just a thought.
right.  you sure i can't just take you to the emergency ward?
yeah, that would be a good move.
you taught me a lot. then i invented.
angie. he says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
that's true. i'll rephrase it. i saw you in court.
yeah.  thanks.
now?
his reactor's starting to overheat.
hey kid, it's me, bill munny.
it was implanted by the agency.
check.
nerves.
she is beautiful.
the delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of hau fat. we'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit i think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the nung river. it's all charlie's turf from there on out.
then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
what will you do...when you find this...secret army?
there's nothing to be scared of, baby. it's just another storm.  try to get some sleep.
it's just that--
i don't need a little.  i need a lot.
well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak english right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause i don't speak french or whatever', and the other guy goes something in paris talk, and i go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and i go 'make me'.
<u>no</u>...<u>no</u> <u>please</u>...!
was that supposed to make me feel better? 
and the fear you showed at our last session?  how did you overcome that?
no. no. i'm fine. i was worried sick about you ... i thought ...
do you want to unclench your fists, please? thank you. i can see in the dark, you know. i've been here quite a while.
i'm opening the side door.  she'll step out.  but before she gets in your vehicle i want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  if it isn't there i'm shooting her in the back.
what do you mean, not enough time?
like her paint job?
it was beautiful. and getting better all the time.
are you lyin' to me?
we think we know where betty is.
you two from the poliakoff agency?
yes.
you’re repeating yourself, mrs de moraes.
don't lie, taylor. i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
we were just chortling over that. blasé and epicene.  it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary. so--i hope you don't mind, edward, i pinched it for my piece today.
uh...c?
it would be. if they were still living.
that's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
what makes you think that?
woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. or a rat. it's an urban myth.
oh yes, i'm sure dr. duval could. if we had the parts.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. but you did it. with work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. if that's what you want to be.
cash poor?
oh no, mr. cluett, if it's all the same to you, i'd rather not wait. it's about you and mrs. dickson.
blind? how stupid can you get, animal? i drank the stuff myself.
uh, yeah, that's...wow.
i read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. i'm that girl's fianc‚.
he used to call me -- tell me that i couldn't just walk out on him.  he said that if i didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
oh, i'm fine.  they've replaced you with quite an entourage.  it's a regular "marching band".  you should see me on the street, you'd think i was the first lady --
i'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
huh?
merrin? i had notion he was over in iraq. i think i read he was working on a dig around nineveh.
right.
all of 'em. his entire entourage. i think we should move.
where'd that come from?
what is it?
very insightful.
that guy was hurtin' me.  and if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  and they woulda made out like i asked for it.  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  at least now i'm havin' fun.  and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  and if i haven't, i wanna take this time to thank you, louise.  thank you for savin' my ass.
well your thinking's not so good.
rifle?
"ex-cia"?  there's no such thing as "ex-cia," john -- they're all ivy league establishment.  is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
you  make me nervous.  anyway if i can pick your brain --
you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what's gonna come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. don't you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
the sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
this is mr. wallace in subscriptions?
the strain was evident.
i wasn't cheating!
are you with the tournament?
it's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
yes.
i just think you used to be bad.
della?
constantly.
a mister quaid?
you shut down your sensors.
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. we got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
i don't think so. keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
that's fair enough, jabez. man's got a right to mull things over. we'll drive round again, week or so.
it is. but that didn't stop me. shouldn't stop you.
hi.  so far so good.  so.  what should we talk about? how insecure we were in high school.  shirley votypka, the first girl i ever felt up. health.  what about health? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
wanna kiss me, jim?
i'm an excellent lawyer.
but, joe - three weeks in florida!  we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
what?
he's alive?
now you thought of that, not me.
and, of course, we are.
but what if...?
no! stop it! it's not funny. mom might do it!  someone else might die.
the prom?  kat has a date?
you gonna open up another sal's famous pizzeria?
ah, macy.  why don't you help janet freshen up before rehearsal.
what's he do now, tell fortunes?
whatta you mean? me?
i'm coming with you.
that's very comforting. but i'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
he's got a point.
why did she do that, jim?
if you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
what are you shooting for?
is crawford going with you?
make a wish, lo.
follow me.
i'll buy that. black's always good.
edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
perhaps.
yeah. before i kick your ass.
oh?
yes, peter.
no. can i move now?
i'm looking for llewelyn moss.
what do we do now?
if that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... i mean...  my, i sound a bit --
perhaps.
i'm not really hungry after all.
oh god!  help!
yeah.
you got a better offer?
the hospital...?
well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
why?
that way we do not waste avgas or our motherfucking time.
will you?
i hope so.
how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
yes?... how was your journey?
of course they were. how many?
get out! get out of the car!
what about it?
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  violent?
quiet.
your honor, if mr. beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? we're talking about aids, we're talking about lesions. let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
hm.
ok, bye, bye.
what's going on?
did you just propose to me?
i'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
know what you are?! you're a prude, roper.
dad, it's not about that. i just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. or at least for a few years.
what'm i gonna do with half a cent? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  everybody loses them fractions?
did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
only make bets i can't afford to lose.  only way to be 100% committed.
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people? don't think so. you see, it's scarier when there's no motive, sid.
i was a jew in a previous life.
i guess they are a little odd.
keep it. 
i can't!
great.  god, i've wanted you forever.
hello.
and look what you've done to mr. bigglesworth!
mary, when you first came here, i told you to look into your heart. you didn't listen to me. you listened to the policeman instead. you didn't find your sister, did you?
that's good. i wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
got a nice evening dress?
you too, my friend. goodnight.
we're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. it just happened. felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to pta meetings?
you've got a thing about ernie's, haven't you?
no, sir!  i just want to do my part. to get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  and i have the experience, i know who the people are...
what's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
koontz!  i need you guys!
yeah. just a bird. just a stupid bird.
dead?
dear david, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. the school term will begin september 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. i do hope everything is fine and you will be here. give my "hello" to your family. yours truly, miss camille johnson...
um-hm. we rode around all afternoon. father was frantic. by 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
thank you.
it's sacrilegious.
plan?... oh, yeah, the plan... yeah...
just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. just a chip of ice.
hm.
maybe, yes... maybe no.
what kind of animal?
a rest?
we're only talking about six weeks.
are you shocked?
i'm thinking of going back to school.
who's your friend?
mrs. macdougall, i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
like a detective.
a few bucks.
what he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' pete...
like cats and dogs.
no! no! i won't.
get a grip.  reed.  we didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  just close the shields...
i was here...as a kid.  i think you were here, too.  but you...looked just like you look now.
what do you mean?
angelo, it's eleven thirty.
i have no intention of getting used to it.
of course, it's him. who do you think it is?
hello, senator.
on a case by case basis...
with all of it?
we millionaires yet?
dr. grant, we're not leaving without our son.
well. i suppose it does a bit. i'm very happy for them, of course, but i'm going to miss them. the ship will seem... incomplete without them.
all the rib eyes?
yeah, like what?
here. you're gonna need this.
we serve the interests of the british people, 007. no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
what about?
chaz, i've got something here on my security alert.  a high priority from the computer...
he's the pro from dover and i'm the ghost of smokey joe.
you should think about getting professional help.
maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
you never know who you'll see.
my name is clarence, and what is yours?
i'm calling gary.
who? elizabeth?
hooper, matt hooper. from the oceanographic institute. 
tons and tons.
i'm gonna go get the money.
my jury's still out on that,
... well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
look, i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i'll leave you alone.
who gives a shit what you believe? in thirty seconds, you'll be dead. then i'll blow this place up...
doesn't mean it's a signal.  could just be the hard drive heating up.
perfect tommy's just threatened by smart women.  can you play that thing?
the witness will substantiate mr. kim's modus operandi. it's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
better ease up then, hawk. wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
okay. yeah.
hi.
you don't know, do you? you're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
his wife.
...<u>nothing</u>...
of course, how stupid of me. a quarter to seven, will that be all right?
where is she?
sam, don't --
drink your beer and don't get so excited.
cain -- like the bible guy?
"gozer" -- he was very big in the sumerian religion.  one of their gods.
so why don't you give me my sandwhich?
united states marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. i have it here, in my briefcase.
where are you off to young lady?
absolutely--marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
like i told to the washington boys, bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge...
why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
boobie... this is the only way you're ever going to learn. i have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
that's not so good for you, my friend.
this one.
i am the walrus.
no.
but you're the fairest by far.
i have to find out what alan wants... that comes first.
no idea.
rogers isn't even pretending.  he isn't just scared anymore.  he's sick.  frank norris told me last night he hasn't known rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
you must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
there is something i want.  a friend.
breaking left!
dr. drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  there are over four hundred billion stars out there --
what year is it?
i do know the answer to that. why don't we watch the ball game later? we'll go to mannion's.
only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. they can sense it miles away. if he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  it's a good time, too. they're night feeders...
i don't like that story.
you're going to look for him -- now?
yeah, but how do you know?
i meet gestapo tactics...i meet gestapo tactics...that's not right... no man has the right to..."call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  that's not...as long as i've...
do you plan everything?
oh that's right -- they squished him... heck of a guy.
you need me.
yeah.
no josh, i don't take orders. not from you and not from any man.
there was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
no, really..believe me - there isn't any more. this is it.
how nice. you remembered. but of course, that was the day the germans marched into paris.
who the hell is he?
"met his death"?  how could you, his friend, have assumed that? why did you leave him on genesis! spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
...i believe, unless i'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
don't be ridiculous.
yes, i'm all right, i'm fine!  go capture him.
oh ... right.
hung up.
i think we're falling in love.
it all keeps coming back to dudley.
i want to know where scully is.
really?  and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
that's jolly.
no.
the worst serial killer in history - who?  gacy - right?  killed forty two people.  our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day.
crop duster.
you'll wreck your raincoat.
well, you can't.  as for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  you're confusing courage with wisdom.  back where i come from, we have men who are called heroes.  once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  and they have no more courage than you have.  but! they have one thing that you haven't got! a medal!  therefore -- for meritorious....
i haven't laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
that's blasphemy!
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god, wouldn't you say?
maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  you look like shit.
and you thought she'd come up here, to me? if she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
she's still working?
do you think i was faking?
no, buddy, i'm the one he wants.
no.
it's just that sometimes i wonder what team i'm playin' on.
wilfred, that's not bad.
why not?
why not?
i'm sure it's lovely.
beth, i can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how i've always felt about you... call me jam. it's my band name.
oh, i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. i haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of sundays. you know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. that used to be my trade from time to time.
i said come on!
he only shot you once.
i lose 'em all, that's why i'm still out here on this rock.  anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
yes sir. i'll take care of that.
i'm in my party mood.
not at all.
i'm fine. kind of tired.
are you sure?
what are ya thinkin', charlie?
what's wrong?
not at all, honey.
no, for that much money i have to tell them exactly which office.  i know, i've had to have money wired to me on the road.  and there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  i'll have to tell you the code.
psychologist, therapist, whatever.
i don't know how to explain it. i'm just too miserable.
old woman!
yeah, real cute. the storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
huh-huh. i'm deeply smitten.
don't tell me where to work. i moved to new york to work for edward dowd. but i can't believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
sure, boss.
"thirty-two?"
i'm not.  i was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
"happy birthday, wanda june!"
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
people forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
yes. again.
they're going to send detectives.
what is the five grand?  what is the, you said that we were going to split five...
it's alright janet.  everything's going to be alright.
i'm askin' you, frankie, to keep an eye on nicky. do it for me.
oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! no, indeed! but a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
oh -- 
take it easy, jake.
you were in an accident?
you get straight to the point, don't you?
she's not here.
the trunk.  it's locked.
fuckers!
why don't you speak to her, ramona? women are good at that sort of thing. think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  you are kind, ramona! speak to her. i know i don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, i'll not forget you or your little girl.
how can we stops him now?
you should really let a doctor look at that.
i do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
and you?
sure.
what of my lips, will you soil them too? when you've broken every other taboo?
how important would it have to be? it's only murder, inspector.
finsbury park. we’re in finsbury park.
your mind kept wandering.  that bothered me.
what about this?
please don't go.
a way to hook this helmet into the game. i'm sure there are interfaces...
take your car.
it's called black leather.
like "three thousand a ki?"  that's nice. and i can supply the transportation into south florida and the gulf, more reliable and on-time than fedex.  but, three per ki was ok for openers.
we have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
you make me sound like the father in "east lynne."
and you're taking?
no.
music?
like what?
sorry, mistress.
i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it'll be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it's in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. don't drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.
swear.
please.
why?
all in norwegian.
'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
okay.
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
you told me no calls.
here we go!
satch, would you listen to me here.  just you and me.  can i talk to you here, alone?
first things first.
it -- she --
it's raymond.
i'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  take care.
i-i'm sorry, sam.
grrrreat!
"mocky-lock is the bogeyman.  mocky-lock wants me where i am."
i have to go back to the hotel. i'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. i will see you at suppertime, rose.
yeah, i'm alright.  is my face still orange to you?
but if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
make a thousand of 'em. still won't be enough by the time i'm through.
she's fine.
engine room, what happened?
who the hell is this?
thank you.  next time i want to break a lease i'll know who to call.
morning, gentlemen.  everything satisfactory? you like your office?
in the back.  down the other corridor.
landon --
i hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
yeah? i have a saying too, lex. it goes, "catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." we're going this time and that's all there is to it.
that's all right... i grow on people.
me too, doc. and i can't tell you what that package meant to me --
that's my girl.
what's happened?
i don't need pills... just sleep.
i... have come to communicate with my user.
w.p. mayhew? the writer?
nothing.  i just wanted you to know i was out.  i just wanted to see you.
thanks, mom... dad?
it's not funny! i mean what am i gonna do? without that yearbook i'm lost. i can't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater!!!
he's a liar! he has no such thing! it's my own fault. i should have had it patented first. he's a crook, damnit.
no, i don't not love you.  i like, i know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  something good. something special.
all sorts of things.  you might even remember you loved me.
this, this... this is bullshit!
just curious.  there's a lot of talk goes around.
no. not everything.
yeah.  crap with a star.
i don't know.  i can't understand it.  something's bothering them.
get his wine away.
you re not thinking of going to...
what's being photographed?
that is correct.

cathay?
i'm pretty happy to see me too. so are you done with me yet?
oh, marty, thanks a lot. that really takes a load offa my mind.
bree, what's actually happened? it wasn't that bad.
that's not the point.
dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry.

captain barbossa ... i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal.
i suppose i could answer you. i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. it's even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  but i don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i don't have the least idea what i am doing, that i am nothing but an incompetent, that i am a fool.  anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
i'm just doing my job.  you gimme that juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
with the priest, you liked them scrambled.  with the dead head, fried. with the bug guy, poached.  now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.

i don't fuckin' cook.
good.  soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
get 'em in the vault!
how long did you watch her?
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...then he quits...same when he runs...seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...so we'll find them in the end, i promise you that...we'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
uh, uh, i think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
we have an enlisted man's club at the post.
mmmm...thanks, patrick.
i am through fucking around! drop that fucking briefcase!
if they were in stasis, i'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. it doesn't make any sense.
saving your life.
buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned bolshevik ideas.
hand-holds?!  i can barely see them.
and the world -- the whole world.
this conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before harold was declared legally dead.
oh well, great.  perfect.  oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
trask --
sweltering.  come on, i'll take you home.
the nails!! watch the nails!!...  listen, you still have to eat.
you've been listening to rumors.
yeah. a bloody funny thing!
o.k. sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
what?
what about the intro?
look, i've got to get a hold of frank and see where i'm hanging my hat 'cause...
i got frightened all alone upstairs, so i came down here.
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
all i said in the note was: "where are you?" that doesn't sound desperate to me.
who?
c!  shit, i'm sorry!
i can’t tell you that yet. but he’s being well looked after.
i didn't hear me say tonight.
i'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  i believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
herbert ...  we built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
no!  you let us handle this.  come along, rool!
i don't know. mr. sampson bought it for me.
i know who you are, doctor venkman.  busting any ghosts lately?
not quite yet, mrs. mothershead. there seems to be some difficulty this morning.
nah, nuthin' on my end --
acheson's scenario is unacceptable. and he has more experience than anyone.
you have personally -
go ahead.  you're safe.  there're thirty cops in this building.
all of which he's now missin'.
that's my stuff from the office...
nice to meet you, mr. ullman.
you mean that?
what's the matter, paden? you afraid i couldn't get those two behind me?
well... well, you see, that's the point. you won't be opening in london.
gotcha.  okay.  supernova bad.
you won't even tell us?
don't be long. i'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
i'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
eight units.  mountain view.
you professional men drive a hard bargain. i'm afraid i only have five on me. sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
and i'll have the special fish.
no.
great, isn't it?
how near is she to death?
would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
we'll see how fast i can fly.
he was obviously able to handle it.
but everybody's having such a good time.
where are your men now?
you know what i mean. you're keeping her there against her will.
everyone take a role. let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. we also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  so, who's going into the basement with me?
so how are we going to get this place shaped up?
all i gotta do is implicate.  the feds can do a lot with a good implication. even if you don't get sparky, i'll bet you get ten to twenty more. plenty of time to find a nice fella.
anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
you must take the oath!  not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
you feel it?  it's different this time.
in the village.  look what i found.
take a look at these.
we have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
no.
saint mario!
sis.
am i starting to look norwegian to you, bwana?
who's he play for?
just lenny.
this is kind of a stream--
nothing much. the remnants of a life raft. maybe a small flag. the emblem of my countrymen.
hi, freckle face.
no what?
where are you gonna go?
all you have to do is phone for it.
jesus christ, bodhi!
that's what i call a payday.
oh, brother...
i'm going to end it, alexander.  as we discussed...
oh no, i'm not. i don't like your face. besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. i'm surprised that mr. cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
leave me alone!
not this time.
you hear that?
near the casino.
the cynicism you refer to, i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys!
yeah!
the other plate is currently in new york, in the hands of kobo's man. find it for me.
he can move in here with us.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
alas indeed, for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
what good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
i'm going after dad.
yeah, you are. he touched you. you're "it" until you touch someone else.
are you guys sluts too? huh huh huh.
"parting is such sweet sorrow…"
don't say that.
you must hate it.
good work, my son.  now all we need is a way to get there.
farley is already a tv winner as we shall see.  dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
there's some good things on it, though.
nothing to discuss. tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. be grateful for small mercies.
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn, loved it when you busted into viva las vegas.
can you sleep?
i was going to catch the last half on tv.
she's obviously that. jesus! which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
how would you propose we handle it, doctor?
what?
that ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
what do your friends call you?-- the ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
and never take.
he's a priest?
don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
shelby!
oh.  yeah.  they... make me take this stuff...
i'm sorry i brought the whole thing up!  if you're gonna flip your wig --
it depends on the condition of the ship.  if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
what is it?!
who knows? if dr. darling is right, you should watch out.
ann. hello.
-- memory?
it's flooding like a son of the bitch.
where was this?
where did moss...?  i...
let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  i've seen it a million times.
that guy sailor came around this afternoon... asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
she's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
okay, shorty... see you in the morning... i'm going to have a little -- word with willie.
all right, then tell me how -

i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
you saved me.
i remember you from christmas eve.  you have a thing for helping women, don't you, officer white?
yes, thank you. thank you very much.
not to mention andrew zhdanov... otis, come!!
you went out with her?
you have everything?
show me.
yes, you was. make him talk.
i'm warning you, don't tempt me.
but it would hurt.
stable. we're looking at low twenties. it's a good number, considering the fallout from --
she's alive, sweetie.
him.
she grow up in livingtston, too?
just remember, i'll be watching.
yeah, he told me once himself. he said to me...
you're fucking twenty minutes late. what the fuck is that?

pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
i dunno. you know.  i used to really love that alice. do you know that?

i appreciate you looking out for me.
i'll do it!  by god, i'll do it!
tucker, i appreciate you doing all this, but i'm really strapped for time here and --
me too.
not yet.  called fbi yesterday. thompson's going to try cia this afternoon.  y'never know.
that depends.  where are we?
darling, for goodness' sake!
to the penny.  exactly one million dollars in cash.
i know i won't be your puppet.
yeah, and with me it was like i was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
i think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
who else...?
why?
the bismark in chicago. you familiar?
homosexual. i like men. sexually.
nothin'.  she's all right. wouldn't have made it without her. christ - haven't worked in eight months. right now, i'm waitin' for some insurance money. and man, when i get it, i got plans to make me some more.  let's get out'a here. this place gives me the willies.  you got some money?
what?
although a cartoon i feel he shares a universal theme: we are all searching for love. no?
could be all night.  guy gets his rocks off like this. hangs out in queer s & m joints downtown.  likes prettyboys like you.
mercy... is to die quickly. perhaps even live in the tower. in time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. somebody was gonna write a book about it.
you wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
call me david.
i think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. i came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. everybody panics. when things get tense, everybody panics. everybody. i don't care what your name is, you can't help it. it's human nature. but ya panic on the inside. ya panic in your head. ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. what you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
what?
downstairs... at the front... jesus...
leave him!
well, i can't reach them.
load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen. i'm mary wells.
you never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? it wasn't such a hell of a life.

what you mean?
adrian -- you've lost it.
you have to put blinders on sometimes. most times.
yeah.
raw carrots and beets.
-is it, i'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
guess who?
zero risk.
he's my son and i like him the way he is. why do you always have to pick on him? if it's not the boy it's me. you don't like the way i live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
there's no other way. tie my safety line to the sub.
what are you getting so hot about -- tommy como told him to come down here...
who's asking?
come on, gimme a break.
that's it.  it's over.  get out.
i want a tape.
i don't want to live any more.
wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
the plot thickens. it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
no! of all...
you've been bitten by a vampire. we've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
he'll catch him.  hi. this is nina aron.  i've got a run away and i'm going to need police assistance.
i'm talking about west! we had him, bill, we were there. you're the fucking base commander, you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
you don't like moore? since when?
i don't think you know what you're talking about.
i don't know.
it's her birthday tomorrow. and i don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? it'll just take a second. she's right off the freeway.
but why?  we raised you as a jew.
i'm flattered. and congratulations to you, of course.
we're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  where's the next one?
where is she?
white light.  pain.  like being ripped inside out... slowly.  like being born, maybe.
once again we find ourselves in agreement.  what kind of work do you do, big dan?
coffee, that's a laugh. his belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
no, sid.
i find out now.
george willis...  ...any leads?
you never cared before.
you.
what do i do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
--i'm not here.
why didn't you come in?
it's true.
the orangemen!  now there's a football program.  jim brown.  and that other tailback ... the one with the blood disease ...
your warehouse?  go on ahead--to your "warehouse." i'll be okay...
my brother is discreet.
right.
an alternative literary venue!
say the greeting again...
print this frank.
cloaking device is stable... all systems normal.
you're pretty quick with those numbers. how about the odds of me buying the first round?
it's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
hang on... 
where is he?
elizabeth!?!  'can't waits any longer.  arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' oh, god!  not tonight.
what do you want, biff?
it was done.  when sophia put the kids to bed, america brought otis in the room and closed the door.  it was done.
sure.
that's what i'm afraid of. "any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
yes, of course. it was quite a while after. i was just out of grade school when they did that.
several.
and we all went through that together?
no.  not yet.  not for about forty years.
i don't think he intends to go that far.
i was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
i needed to feel alive.  i wanted to do something...  outrageous. and... i don't know... it felt good to be needed.  to be trusted.  to be special.
pretty much, yep.
i wish you'd go now.
disappeared!
you're bad.
those two we brought back with us. the girl and the kid.  i don't trust 'em.  i say we terminate 'em while we can.
well... there's one indoors now. i've brought her back to see you.
tipsy, topsy, turvy.
she give you that scar, too?
who's that?
ain't no one seen him.
he jumped. down there.  he's dead, cuervo. i did it. i killed plissken.
jesus - what - i'm afraid - i'm gonna get shot or whatever.  you oughta see it on tv, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
ellis, what have you told them?
no. but you tend to tie them up.
jack!
you've made your decision then7
left jacket pocket?
well what does he want?
sandy, scan the whole sky.
yes. mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. he's in the hospital. how about it?
i wish you had told me then.
4732...?
your mom knows all about the face, okay?  don't worry, she'll tell the face to beat it.
... where are you taking me?
all right.
... is that i sent them here. i told them she came here sometimes. with her dirtball boyfriend. that's exactly what i said.
he did, didn't he?  <u>baxter</u>!
he heard everything we were saying.
use my credit cards.
the airport! hey, wait a minute.
you can't catch this man with a computer.
do you want me to see what's on them?
oh, did i hurt the little girl's feelings? well excusez moi... i confess my desire for adm is quite "intense". so i deceived you and our poor friend terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "the great cure for lycanthropy!" hmph. he didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of adam, until it was too late. and even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if i would be just as shocked! ha.
when i was ten, my family lived in pacifica for a year.  i used to go to the beach everyday that summer. i never felt so happy, carefree. it was a magic place for me... that's where my heaven will be.
i figured that. well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. you'll throw him out. looks like you got a wagonful.
joe, you do get around.
ok, you're scheduled to leave saturday, but we'll hold a seat thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on lufthansa...
i'll let you know the next full moon.
don't have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
now just get off the train.
elaine, what are you doing tonight? would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
there's an atm on speedwell avenue.
oh, good, my way. thank you, vizzini.  which way is my way?
is this friedman, martin?  come on, scumbag. you’ve reached your sell- by date. tell me if this is friedman, where he is in los angeles and what name he’s using?
i didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time. he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. i tried it, but i felt funny thinkin' about my mama. so, i switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. it sure tingles, don't it?
exactly.  the problem comes when the story dies. it happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  however it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
you are talking to him.
oh, you'll help him now, richard, won't you? you'll see that he gets out? then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
that's typical.  i hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
i don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  we went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  it wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
no, i mean david ravell. he's a surgeon.
hell, you know how skinny is. says he's gonna shoot 'em... an i says, "skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "well, then get little bill down here an' let's settle this" an' i says, "bill's sleepin', skinny," an'...
the big boy did...?
if you're not in the car in ten seconds, i'll have the cops pick you up.
that's right, harry.
should i be?
well done you.
but it's light in there now.
pretty good, mr. lundegaard.  you're damned hard to get on the phone.
southglen south competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. we denominators don't even go to prom. -but to everyone else it's huge.
i beg your pardon.
they don't have to.
[beat] what do you need me to do?
yes, i am.
i told you she's just..
of me. oh... god!  my god...  water... it's all water...
you're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte. i tell you that as a friend.
the <u>dogs</u>?
yeah?
yes, a little dizziness, and i think, i think i'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  no, i'm sorry.  it was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
yeah.  that guy who beat me?  i feel stoned.
we'd better get everybody online.  and kyle, stop downloading porn.  your frame rate is unacceptable.
don't let it trouble you. he's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. he won't harm you.
yes.
her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
i didn't mean to liz. i'm sorry.
you.  what' you're doing --
i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him. i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
no.  huron serve no one. the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. but it is the huron path that magua walks down, not the french one... now, les francais, also, fear huron. that is good. when the huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with les francais. and we will trade as the white man trades. take land from the abnakes; fur from the osage, sauk & fox. and make the huron great. over other tribes. no less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
if you'd like to tell me, yeah.
how did she know where it was?
drop the guns! now!
hey, take it easy.
you keep out of this--  you admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
listen.  do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they'd do.
all right, all right -- here -- everything --
sure.  take it easy, dude--i know that you will.
i belong here.
but i understand her. that may be more important.
your first sexual experience.
bet your ass i have. it's an important job, neighborhood watch is.
i don't know, garland; my place is here right now. i feel i'm on the brink of success-
right.  lap-dancers are people too.
she's our inspiration!
oh for fuck's sake.  nobody uses that gate.
would i be the only one?  the only woman?
besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
where?
taking a stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in spring?
i won't let you have it.
what he wanted?  look... look at him. look at him!  what does he want?  this is a person.  this is not a cog in your machine...
i’m sure i’ll find a way.
i have been... i think you're right.
well, that's good, isn't?
let me get you a cup?
why are you bothering me about this? can't you leave it be?
don't you see?  it's the slime.  that stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
hello?
you bet we did.
no, i guess not. it was pretty lousy of me, i guess, to be a child at the same time you were. not to stop being a child just because i had a child. i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
no, i haven't.
i'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
you said you couldn't remember killing officer harrison. correct?
yeah?  is that an embarrassing question?  should i have not asked it?
and when i'm ready, i'll say the words, 'go see the jew.'
tracks ?
what am i doing?  i'm just telling walter the truth.
we shall say ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
wouldn't know what to do with it all --
and what do i do with him?
yeah, right.
you trust him.  he's got that strength.  you'd die in a second for john.
a man has my family.  gold watch here. dark tan.
it's alright janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
forget it, pitts, you're coming.  meeks, your grades hurting too?
you get the guns?
yeah, boss?
dr. winkel.
why?
babes.
maybe.
tell me something, meyer. how can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
it's over becuase...for all the the right reasons i hope, what i said.
sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. except for a nice mlt, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. they're so perky, i love that. but that's not what he said. he distinctly said "to blave." and, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." so you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
all damn.
i'm sorry but ...
we sure need this flamethrower.
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident?
so shoot him.  won't have to feed him that way --
call the others.  laurie, benz...
what was it, roswell? you had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, area fifty one. that's it! area fifty one. you knew and you didn't do nothing!
i left three messages already.
i'm a werewolf.
no. hell, no! you eddie felson?
no.
mrs. robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
forgive me, father.  for i have sinned.
do we shake hands?
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
it's just what he used to say.
you drive! i think there's something wrong with me.
no, he's absolutely right.  you're absolutely right, ryan.  dog talk must be banned.  canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  can i get you a drink?
i can take it, go ahead.
i don't have any business here. i came here for you, i didn't have any business.
mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman. i'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
perhaps -- but if i must face it, let it find me, for i shall search for it no more.
we are...for the tools.
thank you. i'm going to close this up again.
the gun...
this is our choir director.  he's gonna play the young hero.
well, congratulations!  you fucking pulled it off!
we both know what they'll do.
sure will, pal, sure will.
hello, darling.
not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
it was dad, i swear, dressed like a homeless man.  and you know what else was really strange?  a businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
okay.  it's good knowing this.
well, thanks, that's great.
what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than --  come on, sandman.
but ya got a boss.
alright, cut, cut, cut.
liz, i'm really sorry.  the meeting went much longer than expected.
yeah. yeah. i get your thought. you know i seen you lots of times before. parochial school on pulaski street? seven, eight years ago? your hair come down in—
she looked good then.
i seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
that's good. they're allowed, but i don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. you wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
hey. bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
don't you want nice stuff?
the flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
what's happening?
in two more years i'll have an engineering degree. we'll sell the store, we'll move away from burnfield and the store and you standing here.
no, you gotta understand, valiant, i had nothin' to do with acme gettin' killed.  i just wanted to sell my studio.  but they wouldn't buy my property unless acme would sell his. and he wouldn't.  so i was gonna blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
oh. eh, i like it.
this time i really think i have something.
what are you doing?
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone.
she must have a knife or something...
jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
no.
come on, man.  there's love and there's ...
mother mary, full of grace.
what are you doing in my closet?
dick-weed!
i just finished drying...
you ain't woofin' i did.  stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
depression?
the library. i'll be fine.
right. you can't sleep here.
i think i've studied enough.
the fat man on cherry street.  the other fat man, mr. bulldozer.  the trumpet player.  that leaves two.
she's with sarah!
hi, kathleen, i'm just working.
oww...man...
now?
in what sense?
had some bad relationships, didn't you.
i stole it. from a synagogue.
like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
you take charge.
i think you can. in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. he doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
you're burned out.
but the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
come on, cheer up. it could be worse.
how come you're calling me from...?
it's true!
i already said hello.
now stop.  stop.  i beg you -- calm down. have a cup of tea.
fuck you, mr. kane.
i was a mistake.
i'm going this morning.
fine with fucking me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
i'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
don't trouble yourself about it, homer--this ain't your business.
oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
those are her belongings.
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
they've been in there all day.
i'll talk the way i want to. i've had enough of this.
that's it! exactly! you're reading my mind --
and?  she's not saying, "i think you're a nice guy and i wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "i wanna bone."
we don't know that's true, he never said that.
who gives a fuck?! i was just fucking with him!
i'm sorry, ward.
marvin a. pickles.
werewolves simply do not exist.
do you?  even assuming you're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte.  if ambrose is going to sell chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss hall's blood to market.
well, i'm not saying that i want to join or anything, but...but i know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
that would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, will?
so what do we do?
hey, you promised......don't worry, i'm wearing my girdle.
yes.
why? what's happened?
damnit, thelma, don't holler like that!  haven't i told you i can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
maybe i'm not understanding the question.
like rome?
of course i mean it! i don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as i can get her back. 
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva?
yes, i've seen it before.
i think you didn't get that lot in the navy, doing your national service.
clark kent! you socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
i guess...i don't know...i guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
kansas?
ok.
ladies and gentlemen: the "straub country-residence".
i think so...what do you think?
transmits and receives.
i am the future.  i am all colors.  all races.  all creeds.  i am the melting pot.  i am the tossed salad.  i am post racial.
yeah...?
christ, you're right -- gray makes jerry ford look like mozart.  just have helms call him.  helms can scare anybody.
i don't know. maybe he doesn't know, either.
um-hmmuhh. i never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. ehh-hh, lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. lay there and sweated blood for hours.
okay. if you think it will help.
you're kidding.
minus three.
twenty-six.
good things happen, too, creasy.  like meeting me.
does it work?
i had you covered.  from back there.
it's a pleasure.
did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
your reputation is secure, scotty.  mr. sulu, take the con. i'll be in my quarters.
how did you know we were on this island? do others know? will others come?
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
fine.
we know who stole the missing item. if the thief returns it, i'm sure sir te will pursue the matter no further.
so!
i can look and see.
are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
terrible, thank you.
there's no need for language, mr. hockley.  go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
well, where are you going?
wasn't it?... i have a dream almost every night now.  the lady and the tiger, you remember that story?  in the dream i'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  i have to make the decision.  which door conceals emma?  and i just stand there... looking at the doors...
i'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
are you busy on saturday?
you haven't even driven a car since you took office.
you'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. just get out of here.
yeah. yeah, i heard about that.
i heard your mother took sick, that so?
i didn't know they had a fight.
what's the big idea?
not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
no, mr. danvers.
i talked to most of them this morning... they were all very curious about the meeting.
you will what?
i'll tell you the events. the psychology's none of your business. hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. graham shot him with his .38 six times. hobbs still didn't go down. he had to wade in...
what for?
and then i, and then i been workin' for honeywell for a few years now.
you eating with us?
you saw that on t.v., cole?
i'll be all right.  i've got asta to protect me.
i like having the car, the car is important.
i don't think we were the first.
if you wanna help, then help. if not, shut up.
this is jill, carol, betty, mandy, louise, pete over there, and i'm carmen.
the only memento i ever kept.  my original sketch for the monster.
of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
good god, you're really-
-- see this, television!
try.
about the accident.
why?
but kirk...
i'm...what?  sorry?
shut up! shut up, jack!
no. i was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. maybe see where you grew up--
so it's ok if i bring her.
we were gonna be millionaires you said. nobody'd suspect a thing. i had never even met her. no connection. then you went and had that fucking car accident.
not such a menace now, is he, pinkerton?
i got sal.
home of the brave.
we went to code blue...
no, no, no, i told you. they're fine. they're all real happy.
she what run you off? not what i told you 'bout sethe?
nick, what is it.
need we go through it all again?
nothing.
one minute to warp core breach.
it's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
i'm rather embarrassed, general solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
he said i was right. i shouldn't wait for him. i was better to make a clean break.
ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
there wasn't any plane.
a lathe??? get off the line, guy.'
it's just -- fabulous.  think you could do anything for me?
good news travels fast....
no, boy. thirty-eight cents worth of gas. and watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
looks like you'd make a good runner.
it's money.  people use it to purchase goods and services.
i'm sorry, i didn't catch that. what did you say?
normal. average.
i'm sorry, i --
is you all good nazis?
you'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
there are caves in those mountains.
russian, i think. i don't know.
oh she's a beauty.
...ditioning.
she's my best friend. i gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. i've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. she's lonely. if pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
you heard them. i don't have that authority anymore.
lotta water.
he seems like he thrives on danger
i got two kids ... and i'd like to see them again.
dad!  save yourself!
i will.
i... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  to his appearance.
what?! it looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
physician, heal thyself.
it's not bad.
evan shaeffer's dead.  guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
what do you think his name is?
hello, anna ahm...  scott -- have some wine.
i'll go even further and say that her presence here -- i don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
for a little while.
i'm a dangerous man!
i don't follow...
huh?
you're a pretty shrewd baby.  we better get away from this gang. talk this thing over privately.
they want to discredit you -- for what?
monsieur laszlo, is it not?
i wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--i expect i'll find some ways to be of use.
don quixote.
you're kidding.
keep them coming?  ah, yes.  ha ha.  you are right.  but money.
frank galvin.  we've met before.
there's a lot of valuable shit in there, applejack. the silver and the china. the crystal. and the grandfather clock. goddammit, i bet that clock's worth ten grand.
go down there and kill everybody, i guess.
he's not part of the program.
when it comes? what'd you tell him?
yeah? give me a goodbye kiss.
the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  but because i'm a female, i get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  i'm a ballplayer, okay.  a ball player.
very deep... usually...
yes.  we did.
that's hamburger grease, bill.
yes, he is.
what else you got?
what's daddy doing?
do you dance?
i think you gave me the wrong one.
a girl. melissa.
i'm in my p.j.'s, too. funny, huh?
one of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
it hurts.  aw, jesus!
then he drove me home.  he tried to put himself away as legit, so i went right into the pitch.
yeah? what makes you think so! he took his suitcase and everything.  kinda surprised, huh? it's just like i told you, zeke. they ain't married a'tall . . .
here. am i ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
not at all. 
well, i just wanted you to know how i felt. hell, i know air command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  and don't think i don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of negro descent.
only a handful of people are aware of its existence. let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
so what?
my shift ends at four, but i couldn't --
i just might look in on new you 483 myself.
why don't you go check it out?
nothin'.  i told ya everything there is.
i'm scared.
actually, that's his night job.
no. but i'm sure keaton's dead.
oh, sandro... i'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...i tried to hide myself...i feel so small... i hate myself ...
i promised her she'd be safe.
thank you.  would you like the man's name?
i did no such thing!
why?  why, because you only told me about it?
who?
two d-6's.  that's the kind his well was fitted for.
we might have to take that chance. cause i feel pretty strongly about this.
no...
no.
you should shit or get off the pot.
turbine chamber on number two must've blown! took out part of the hull!
and end up in the papers?  i've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  i'm sorry she got you canned.
i need it.
soran doesn't care about power or weapons. all he cares about is getting back to the nexus.
bodeguita del medio.  it's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
what am i going to do with a microwave?
sure you did.
so you've heard all those stories about me. well, i can assure you they're not true. and if they were true, i've retired.
and wasn't that an oath...? these are your initials here: k.c. when you signed this chart you took an oath. no less important than that which you took today.  isn't that right?  isn't that right...?
why is it always this? i owe it to myself? what if i don't want to?
nobody's going to do that!
feel free.
thanks.
i took a loan on my car and my computer.
oh, great, great.  yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
it came on about two hours ago. woke me up.  we won graham.
we've got to get out of here.  c'mon, hurry
aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
i sort of like what you said.
i thought the porters had instructions from the high lama not to take anyone.
a portrait? do you ever see a portrait?
you can tell that from here?
but not pike's.
what a loser she must be.  anyhow, court's invited me to the hamptons for labor day weekend.
what's with you people? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? i came through, man.
that's delusional.
climb out to where?
no, you're the muffin.
why?
that sounds very simple, dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
this isn't any better, chris.
sure.
make him stop.
you think it over, leon.
sometimes, yeah. you know, i started to do performances.
good afternoon, bobby. i'll let max know you're here.
which country?
i don't like your tone.
i thought you had her!
good.
i don't know what i've done.
yes, mr. fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  oh - zowie! i'll give her the message. 
goodbye.
roger that, north island. arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. over and out.
we already know what you did. we saw it on television.
one last time. give me the box.
i've changed my mind. i'll come to moscow. if you -- are still going --
remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
you've been going round-the-clock?
i see.
ext. dam - day.
i'm trembling with excitement.
yeah, well, mikey, listen up. cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
two.
i'll be right out.
no plates. no registration. serial numbers removed. and all prints washed off by the river. that's great. this is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
jee... fuck... you’re fucking mad!
that's all very fine if it works out. a little amazing, of course.
goodbye.
impact in fifteen seconds...
we're going to have to stop for gas soon.
most natural thing in the world!
thank-you ...
sorry about this hand.  you know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
how goes it, darlin'?
mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
what will happen to him, ted?
i work for him.
well, even to work there would be wonderful. is it beautiful?
okay.  let's step up the surveillance on her.  put on two more guys.
he's a compulsive heating engineer. a maverick ex-central service repair man with a grudge against society. now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, i think. at least we will be when i get this layton woman under arrest.
how could i forget?
what the hell is going on here?
no, you're not really getting married?
i'm taking my car, and i'm taking it now!
just a guess. she ain't dead though is she?
if you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  see if his name's on it.  how about it, harry? can i watch my damn movie?
yeah, but it's all about simon now... you helped with the dog... and now there are other things. i'm just as concerned as you are about simon.
what kind of man?
it's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! you no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! or crack your mouth, so i can put it to its one pleasurable use! you're not my wife, no! you're one among my many jailers, aren't you?
what?  what do you remember about that -- dumper?
now wait a minute. you're coming with me. you're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. pool game is over.
i was lucky.  the others weren't.
remember what lenin said in 1917, mr. president: "the power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  the communists have never been closer.  now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  let the communists know you're onto them.
she's my sister.
donny-nothin'!
so what happened?
please, no apologies. i've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. you'll have round-the clock care.
after the diplomat! paul clambers in the back.
because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.
i'm not heartless, ma'am.  i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me, i'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, ma'am -- a great responsibility.
i'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
get in.  this side.
nothing. heard you were in town.
this is about power and you haven't got any. there's nothing more you can do. i'm sorry. thanks for trying.
drew, i know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
missed it. can i get a fifth of old crow?
i <u>like</u> our history. and i like you. i'd probably like <u>brill</u> if i ever got to--
lucy.
yes, i will.
one zulu is only one man.. ..and i'm afeared of no one man... but the zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop. what do you want to know?
i know what he said.
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman...
didn't i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you?
don't worry, we got the wallet. what happened?  he get ya with the knife?
jeffrey, i don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can i borrow her?
i <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
you could give me your baseball, so i can drive this bastard nuts.....he's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
you really love this guy...?
that's exactly what i said ... before i said - great, it's a sensational idea."
yes. sorry.
great.
keep trying.
what you're telling me is that i'm dead. right?
a regular outlaw.
-- barry, if i were to say to you i haven't seen evil dead ii yet, what would that mean?
when was this?
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium - found in asia.
am i on tv?
who's the hostage, sayer, her or you?  you look kind of "captive" yourself.  while you're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone, guess what, i guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  get off my property or i'll call the cops.
i can hear her. oh mother of god, i can hear her.
...that's probably a more appropriate analogy.
of course tonight.  is that a problem? like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
you'll keep your trap shut, all right.
okay. i guess so.
i'm going to work in the garden.
'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
i shore could, miss rebecca.
no.
they think we like it.  maybe they think it turns us on.
whatever you say, lady.  it's all in a day's work for me.
but, darling, you can't do that.
i don't know.
i saw you look off when francois nodded his head.  i figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
there's one thing about this wedding i want you to do. call this number. it's a business number. ask for ronny. invite him to the wedding.
genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
downstairs.  there must be an extension.  oh my god --
how do we decode it?
"closed, closed, closed." but with your music.
and i need a drink.
but big enough for us...
like winton marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  louis was playing.  god was smiling.
listen.
yeah, i did, you condescending fuck, but i miss snoopy coming out at the end.  isn't your enjoyment impaired?
you'll see those committees when we're finished!
that's not bad for any day.
what?
i knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when i was 8.
no, thanks. i've promised to play cards.
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
i can't believe it, daddy. i know it must be true, but i can't believe it.
i'll call you a cab.  if you want the clothes, pack them up.
fine.  i'm only here a couple of more days and i'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
the lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
what?
not in the least.  after all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
is he the puritan?
a rough estimate.
up yours.
how she doing?  i ran into her last night.
yeah, it's good to get together.
sure, i remember tom from the old days.
swear.  olaf, metal!
thank you, sir. i've looked forward to this for a long time.
takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. some pretty tough fellas were in the way. they left me this—  —to remember them by.
you sure do.
i'll make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor's pen.
bet you thought you'd never see me again.  i didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
i see.
grandma dodi's pork rib joint.
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are.
what do i do?
there is no information available on the man before he moved into benjamin rand's. it has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the united states government.
how old are you and your sister?
get a goddamn job, al. you've got a negative attitude. that's what's stopping you. you've got to get your act together. i'll help you.
he hadn't even been there. and all those years i thought he was dead.
he didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
sssshhh. on screen the phone rings. the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. she grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
no need to be rude.  i'll do it.
well... i guess i should go.  perhaps we could get together again?
nervous! why should i be nervous?
it sounds wild.  so now you're a big hero, right?  for fixing their system.
what a smart kid you are!  okay, eat.
i don't know....
sure did. i'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
no, sir.
we're hungry.  you're going to cook.
i could come for a second opinion?
meaning?
yeah?  you think he'll let us in, we got snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
don't expect me to tell you who i am.
of course.
you flew all the way h...
daddy's dead.
undoubtedly. not the ascetics of course but, well saint thomas more...
i really did think i was still in reality. at least, until now.  beam me up, scotty!
no, captain, not for us... for v'ger.
i don't think so, homer. *i'm* the lucky one.
i'll see you shortly. a meteorite just hit the ground near here and i want to check it out .. won't be long.
why's she blind, bro?
well, i'm contracting the land.
i thought it was -- nobody ever said, "i should have spent more time at the office."
ever hear of the deluxe french cleaners on wabash avenue?
yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago... he talks crazy but i brought him along...says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
why george, you big softie...
it's killing me.
i'll do that.
okay, okay...
that's what i'm talking about, man! that's why anarchy 99 was born.
once a file's been sent to the caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
it is not my practice to spy on the president.  doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
yeah.
if she paid you well?
then we'll never make it.
you came.    i'm your aunt carlotta, my dear.
yeah, well, i'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. but, i chose you and that's fine.  i'm jessica matthews.
you've made us look pretty good in the past week.  and the way you handled the press --
you want i nut him in the boat?
yeah, you know. suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? she's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
yes.
yeah.
i don't think that's the way it works, cole.
but they sneer, don't they?
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
oh i been out.
well?
i know what you mean. that's why i stopped.
fine.
yes sir.
but, hildy, i can't. he's accused of stealing a watch. and they found the watch on him.
fill for a second.
then he must have pulled her.
i wouldn't know.  that time he caught me was a accident.  i led with my right.
then maybe so do we. every night of our lives. he was my brother. my maker. he gave me this life, whatever it is.
ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
is it cold?
shuddup.
just like that --
why?
sure.  for five bucks.
i didn't do anything --
the reprieve for earl williams.
well, for later then.
you were chillin', kind of creepy even. you totally fucked with his head. i'm gonna go grab dinner.
everything.  start at the beginning.
thank you, trubshaw ...
i gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
for him?
i'm afraid it's been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars.  but i have the memories.
because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. she's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
but you're the one i want to tell— what you said over nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— i'm guilty— you hear me? i'm guilty... .
did what?
yeah.
it certainly is.
could i try that?
i'm doing fine.
it's loaded... i got some shells in here.
more bullets in the gun... the trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
you are on my ground.
mrs. blaine? i can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill del sizemore.
well, why'd you have to tell that indian story?
i borrowed it from this guy i know. so?
it was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
how much time is left?
are you trying to excuse our holocaust?
this is madness!
i'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
huh?
it would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
there is nothing in that statement the president can't explain.
of course it hurts. what does it look like?
i'm a writer myself, you know.
but i did not deal with it, sir. i let it prevent me from helping my friend.  does that make me a coward?
it's long and personal. it has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
that's a solid name.
no, i can't.
let me ask you something, do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? who the hell are you kidding? i was there, remember? i saw you and your brother --
oh, i'm sorry.  did i embarrass you, sweetheart?  oh...
then where is she?
is this fun?
nothing.
what about keith?
yeah, sometimes.  i like to dabble, too.
uh... they change it every month. i wouldn't know.  if there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you gotta draw 'em out.
just so, alfredo. there isn't any. and if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
can i ask -- how you found me?
i overheard him with the girl.
three seasons.  they found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail.  i was wife number three -- the ingenue.
you should see my appointment book. it got crazy.
yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson".
true.
well, how about hypnosis? that can't hurt him!
after all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
"a beautiful geek? what're the chances?"
why would you ask now?  you never asked before!
yes you do. if you love me you can wait, right? a month, six months, whatever it takes.
hide it behind the gas station. then we can get the hell out of here.
shut up!
do it. go to red alert.
you'll be rich!
no. come on.
hell, i might be able to juice the whole area, if i can get to the power box. it's just a couple of cables...
no, not carlotta. elster's wife.
what do i want?
well, i obviously do. and i also know that leon’s not here, rhian. but i thought that you might know where i should look for him.
yeah, that one.
good morning, madam.
i came out here with a dream. that's gone, but i settled for reality.
no, i haven't heard.
i can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
so you got a girl?
that's your problem. you shouldn't've smoked the guy.
well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
what did you find?
good night.
mom?
jeffrey, are they important things? well forget me - you have to tell him. jeffrey, i mean it.
okay.
who?
we'll use smoke pots. like the army uses.
you understand? what? let you go?
jesus. any word from brent?
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  till then, fuck you.
don't worry about it, pal.
looks more like the ghost of the old south, but we'll try her.
it couldn't be for that incident with burgel the other day.
just kidding.
[i should start going for your tits first.]
i have to go. he sighs.
terrific. what the hell was she doing there?
how is central these days?
that was just talk!  fantasy talk! what are you, nuts?  we talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. i would never. . . i mean, i take very seriously our strict moral code.  the line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
huh.
oh come on. for her first time?
look.  i'll see you tonight, ok?
yo, jumbo. we got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
i <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  it was <u>monday</u>.  the day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  and had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
and what do you want for christmas?
at least we found the diamonds.
how is your tea, john?
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods.
it's a shame.  he's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
be ready to leave in two days' time. same place as last night.
the real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
oh, man.
make sure you see cash from this guy, eddie.  he's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
right.
is he straight?
you have his address?
we own a small family grocery store.
what do you mean, alone?
the professor asked me for it -- i thought it was for something scientific!
whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
now.  no, don't kill him.
we insist.
i think something's wrong, too, miss. but not the same thing. i think your private detective is what's wrong.  i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from norman bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
i cannot go with you.
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
calls for speculation.
no, it's not.  it's for this.
i guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
i do.  your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was.
why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  i want to eat the onion like an apple.  do you understand?
i hate to be alone. but i've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
oh well... you know me.
hey it's me, what are you doing?
i'm glad you're here. can you stay for a while?
sit down, stop.
there's a store around the corner, i'll be right back.
herman.
oh, god! i'm going to die!
but, i didn't ask him to kill.
he didn't?
no.
we haven't heard from him.
no, it'll run independently. it can watchdog the mcp as well.
stop! you stop right here. i don't want to know anymore. i told you not to do this bachelor party thing. you were warned.
oh yeah.
a lame ?
yes.
okay.
i tell you, i feel like a ghost.
ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  that'll have to go in any paper i write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  you know the academic world as well as i do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  that means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
zoe, come say hello to your father...
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
okay, ma. don't you worry.
really?
subspace frequencies are jammed by wormhole effect!
well, what'ya do?
oh, really? you wanna go look?
the plastique i found.  is the building on fire?
i promise.
no. my mother.
gold--digger, huh?
let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we'll see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
just as well, lenny.  you gotta get past it.  i mean sure, faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, i mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
he <u>was</u> a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
so, relic, you want to open pandora's box, do you?  see all the mysteries exposed?
she deserves every penny. they pay great athletes a fortune. well, marylin rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
tell me about the suitcases.  what is the make and the color?
i'll no forget you.
he doesn't want you at all.  he's after someone named skywalker.
no, richie, what do i look like?
you'll hate me now, won't you?
i'm trying, mom.
mara...?
not at all.
i guess i have said enough  i'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
about that roadhouse -
how do you know the king's going to let you walk?
you're crazy.
absolutely.
yup.
oh... um, william.
and i'll give then proof!
no - i've been abroad for a long time...
i can't help how i think. you're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
- i told you! he was there! -
i feel the same way.  what next?
me too.
uh, she just saw you, sir...
hey lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
maybe if you didn't go rambo every time i did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. meantime, i gotta feed my little girl.
oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all --
alright.
so what do we do now?
where is she?
pull the other one, why don't you! we made a deal!
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings. they push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. we've taken to chaining ours together for safety. i'm aldys.
tell me one?
getting to what?
i want to help with the family finances. i want you to buy some stocks. and gold. by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. then you sell.
claude. that's my name. claude. that's never happened before.
homework?
i'm coming with you.  besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
a thousand.
jeff -- huh?
you were shot in the head. the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
so, what is it you do, mister...?
yeah, sure, karen.  you bring in chirino, you can be on the task force.
she's off limits for bums like you. leave her alone.
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
lock's busted.
i'm not the one who put this scar here.
most of the time, all three precognitives will see an event in the same way.  but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
promise you what?
we're on our third pitcher of beer. just ask me.
hi.
the moon?
it's just -- i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. create something...
no, she doesn't, either.  you've got tons as well.
wait.  something's wrong.  i don't...
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards?
is it so bad?  it would be quick. he wouldn't even have to feel it.
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week.  she's a fucking mess, joe.  your sister is a fucking mess.  she needs you.  i talk to her more than you do.
implanted.
we've lost enough agents for one night.
that a fact?
it's just my stupid back. i'll be all right in a minute...
what?
yeah?
my lord.
nothing.. selling is selling.
yeah.
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  and pretty lucky for you.
yeah, but we got a little bit done. and if you do a little and i do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
sit down, jake.
how did you know?
...don't get all...
i know. i tried that.
where'd you get this, mayo? this is really wonder work.
do you want to see some pictures? i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. how stupid, right?
this is it!  this is it!  quiet, quiet, quiet!
hello, thomas, how do you feel?
something like that.
the hell does she want?
nor i, on the second.
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
big as a house.
where were you the day he died?
i told you! right here!
what's all this for?
i know what's eatin' you, kid. but i got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. and that's just for openers. we got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
and the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
some village in the mountains -- alethera, i think.
oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
why does this sound so familiar?
very much.
not true.  shall i tell you what you were thinking?  you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt.
stupid dog.  i don't get it.
well, you see, thomas i figure the big problem is the supermarkets. but patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. the supermarkets don't carry italian meat.
annabelle, how's your video rep...
-- the sadistic prick --
myself... and a few other friends of zephram's.
why did you kill my mother?
make a lovely item for "good morning, america"
"...of perpetual distances."  everybody's checking their shoelaces. pins drop.  "i'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  i say...
my parents know i'm out.  they know i'm here.
listen very carefully, i'm telling the truth... this is the game.  this was all the game.
layton.
it will heal.
yeah, i guess it is. we did it! we did it...damn! we sure did it!
there's something going on, z --
oh let's not...
just say no.
you really hit a guy with a bottle?
why?
oh, nick, nick... i can't take this.
please.  we don't need to talk about drew.
lotsa hints--
you don't have to burst in here every time, jerry.  just call and make an appointment.
but how do you know if the people are guilty ?
be careful.
the limitless power of...
no.
no i didn't see anybody i know. no i don't want to go to school here tomorrow. i want to go home.
ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  we can all agree to disagree without making threats.
like you shot winston hancock?
it must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
all right.
can we look at one?
remind me not to go to lunch with you.
sshhh! he's in there.
... are you joking?
i reckoned.
yeah? and what else am i supposed to do? there's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
we understand your concern, but we've made our decision, doctor. any questions? anybody?
there's nothing wrong in liking sex, john.
that's right.
like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft.  he doesn't have it here any more.  used to be like a rock.  too bad.  i think it's time for him to retire.
so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
diedre mayfair was your mother.
you heard me.  you. congress and cabinet heads.
reed said it'd be weeks till --
i wanted to be the host of dance fever, somethin' like that...
the nail polish, walter.
a lot of things i'd like to forget.
i haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
yeah. what?
hey bob, come on! talk to me hunh, it's your friend red, i'm only asking you for three days chief...
where are you going?
no!  you're not tearing me loose any more.
....i made a call.....  ....and, uh....
because.
that's gonna end tonight.
it will grow back again!
you can stay here.
those sluts!
not on this trail, i don't. i've been over it before. anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. why don't you climb in back.
i will not.
i'm not sure.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
it doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, doc.
well. obviously no one you have to worry about... woody.
you're going to live here permanently?
barbatus?
i beg your pardon? miss olsen i'm miss olsen -- mr. sheldrake's secretary.
nobody worried about your father.
thanks, jack.
his i know.  yours i don't have a clue.  but if it wasn't for you, i think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
i agree, majesty, but i'm afraid it's not possible. the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop.
mmmm. i like to swim. we might get along very...
{suddenly unctious) oh, but of course ...
don't get up. take a second...
makes cecil b. demille look like the senior class play, right?
yes.
hello, martin.
we can't really bring another family in here with us.
what?
it came from your great, great, great grandmother, isabelle tourez, who lived in paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  the ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
i heard it.
it is. there's something we need to talk about. something i need to ask you...
who the fuck do you think you are? where the fuck do you think you are? why the fuck do you think i shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
you don't get it, he's after me...
i'd like to visit texas one day, sir.
the power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  what if we feared the power to go away?
you know i can't make that promise.
-- guess we know where mr. price is now.
you don't use shit?
uh.  you hate my guts?
what is it out there, anyway? forty-five knots?
i'll pay you 500 each in advance and i'll mount you on those.
all right. shells?
what is it?
well, cohaagen, i have to hand it to you...this is the best mindfuck yet.
oh, i was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
just....following procedure, sir. they're entitled to burial.
honey, she's perfect. she works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. and they love her, even brother likes her though he won't admit it. i think she's just perfect.
well...if you're in my head... to you, i'm...god!
yes.  but do you know?
ever'thing's okay, boy. i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then i'm gonna go on and leave here.
nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
what?
simone does not control my destiny.
move it. we got exactly five minutes left.
yeah!
how would you like to give frau schulz a pair of silk stockings for christmas?
i could accept everything that's happened; i could accept it, but that i never had a choice.  from the time i was born, you had laid this all out for me.
harry, i hate being in love. i don't ever want to be in love again. i just hate it!
this isn't about me anymore.
that's why we tied him, dumbass.  now come here and see this --
got me.  but unless the will shows up by friday midnight, it's theirs.
it presses us but it is good for us too!  louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  we are less ready, but so are his guards!
who?
dickie?
'no, turn over 4 trs's and tell them we need radar feedback before the kft's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes i made in that speech or i'll pelt you with olives.
the americans! who are they to put us on trial. let us imagine paul when their president kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ what do you think would have happened? no different.
haven't i covered some territory? it feels like i've been on a cook's tour[18] some place.
whatta' you whinin' about? he said i'm next.
if you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
i remember harry always trying to help someone. he got lulla's daughter out of trouble. he was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
i heard about it.  you're lucky he lived.
please, really. i'm not hungry.
that's always been my problem.
three years ago i said them very words. no and good.
all i said was that it sounds like a good idea.
when you make sense i'll listen.
lieutenant doolittle, i'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
underground.
so what?
they found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
i know.  i'm the one who shot him.
but she is not an enigma mother. everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. one, two, three, right down the line.
what girl?
you sure about all this?
the money, icey.
i'll be up later.
piss.
an institution? a madhouse?  people always call a madhouse "someplace."  put her in someplace!
it shouldn't have. but it did.
marty, do you see your suspect?
make me forget it, baby.
come on, don't be a pussy. everybody has to work.
you knew it was me all along?
i don't know. it just feels good. always did.
seven minutes.
what? no! look.
she could make you drop three pounds in one class. she's completely gifted!
no way, cooch.
of course. he knows everything about dick low.
gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
not much.
i don't think so.
you can?
c'mon.
in case they try to kill us. i don't know, what do you want me to say?
at least you always have enough water. how many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
think about it -- but don't take too long because i'm out of time. if you change your mind, this is where i'll be.
i understand the risks involved here. but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid 6.7 than barnes. and, there is nobody who knows him better than you. if a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. i have complete confidence in you.
it’s an unbelievable thing.  wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  i’m gonna buy it...
don't talk to me like i was a second violinist. go back into the waiting room. miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you.
i know what it comes with, but that's not what i want.
they can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the sats. we'd suck in everything. all foreign, most domestic.  domestic was my group. druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. anyone we wanted.
who? applejack?
it's initials.  f is feur.  it's her.
too busy playin' ball, huh?
they...
don't be nervous, maggie.  let us visualize.  remember what bob said? "be the ball."
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris, in prague, in brussels, in amsterdam, in oslo, in belgrade, in athens.
gross! you must remember to tell me this in the morning. i'm, like, so freaked out now.
it was a slow night. i went to a hotel for a few drinks.
i'll be at the bridge.
well, i'm sorry i won't see ya.
and with the mikes, i'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
it's a week.  we didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
gosh! what do you know about that!
i know where deauville is for c-c-christ's sake.
yeah, what?
hey.
can you tell me how you spell...
because his mother got sick - very sick.  he couldn't leave her.  he's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
not too far.  my folks bought a place over on elm street.
give her a chance, will you?
this date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
consider this my resignation --
no, my dear, he is a federal agent.  he killed two of my colleagues the other night.
come with me.  the team's already waiting.
what if i answer yes?  will my wish come true?
i don't know, sir. your dear parents.  suddenly gone. so much loss...
i think i've heard of you.
they told me you were dead.
now you're an accomplice in a homicide. everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
the father!
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
missing what? he didn't say shit.
your what?
that's okay too.
my version of "take this job and shove it..."
that's my fault, not hers.  i've got to keep practicing.  i'm still in the learning stage but magic, madmartigan, requires concentration and--
okay.
butch! i'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  now, you can't double-cross me!... she does? all right -- put her on. i'll talk to her... hello! oh, hello, madam... now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep butch away from his duty... what's that? you say that again and i'll come over there and knock your eye out! hello?  i'll kill 'em! i'll kill both of 'em!  duffy!  mousing around with some big blonde annie on my time! that's co-operation!  duffy!!
the orderly heard lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and miggs crying. they found him at bed check. he'd swallowed his own tongue... chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. i told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  starling...?
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
it is my oil!  mine and my family’s!
you'd know i wouldn't run off.
yeah, and in california you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... and i heard your first month's rent is free; state law. i figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
i don't know.
he's a good kid. a salesman.
and losing you, we’d lose him. and that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
will you please wait a second. shelly.  please.  murray told me: the hot leads...
it took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
but they have to be warned, sheriff.  jason will return to the area that's familiar.  no matter what you call it, it's still camp crystal lake to him.
go to sleep.
you mean like you loved mom?
he wasn't superhuman dewey. he wasn't superhuman at all.
i'm frightfully sorry. there is a telephone in the public house about a mile down the road. i suggest you use that.
don't shoot.
i will do so as soon as possible.
hello miles.
- to her cooking.
how does it work?
it'll make it.
oh my, this is very interesting.  say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
no shit.
that's the only reason, period. they only want one certain kind of black comic.
him?
i don't remember.  i guess so. smells like it.  tastes like it.
not for a few years.
well, let's broaden our outlook.
going to try. didn't say i could.
lady, by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
where would you go to sell a chip?
you on the game?
yes...
it was an accident.   gifford, too.
no.
just a waitress.
is that all you're going to devote your life to?
well, it's up to you.
oh.  er... well you're the file clerk.  you're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into janet.
like i said, dazzling.
but it is what i want.
so that was why she tried to run away.
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. i see a power void to be filled. as we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
isn't it true?
what do ya want the others to get?
yeah, i'm 'bout it.
hell of a spot to put a business.
all right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
i wish i had an answer.  evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
use your grenades! maybe we can blow it up underwater!
don't look at me, buckaroo banzai.  i failed flight school.
no primer.
yeah.
checking in...karla wilson.
...polacks...
would you mind opening the window?
you want a convertible or hardtop?
a native is someone who is born in a particular place.
it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes.
hospital clean.
what are you doing here?
what i do is trick him to the surface, got that? then i can jab him, understand?  think i'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
oh, please...
nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
what view?
i don't think it really matters, hannah. we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
well, maybe that's what they teach you in new york university. in real life, it don't work out that way. you wait till you are a mother.
what was what?
no, sir.  it will never happen again.
you the only cat don't come on with that "whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
i beg your pardon?
how can i trust you when you look at me like that?
geeeerta rauuuss!
so now you know.
i wonder if she'd go out with me.
that's what makes it romantic. every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. but us -- you never know where i am and i'm not sure where you are. that's romance!
that conviction doesn't convince me of anything. until i know that i did it, i'm not going to accept that i did.
ok. maybe i'll walk down with you.
don't make me... me... me... get up!
don't need it.
pity.  bring him whatever he wants.
no, sir!
that was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?
no!  why would i want to kill him?
where is mrs. brown?
they would, huh?
at sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. she is brought to the duke…orsino.
the last i heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed's hill.  with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
john.... how can you ever forgive me?
the point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  if we can pull this off, maybe i can restore their faith in me.
i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i'm starting the blonde legal defense fund.
yes, sir. it's getting larger as we close in.
make dat money.  get paid.
it's a place where religious people--
i hurt my finger.
his.
have you ever bent your knees, malcolm?
uh huh.  right here in river city.
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl's well was carl's own spare.  even though it was too large f...
thought i'd take a walk. any law against it?
how tired you are!
he's a big one.
come on, margo.  we're on the verge of something huge.  let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  what if john was right.  i mean, what if?  and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  when it got to the museum, it hatched.
...gger.
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah... because i've bought options on property all over town.  i need max's financing...
shhh... that's for me to know an' you to find out.
oh my god!  i don't understand.  if you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  everything i got is yours.  i got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  it's yours.  you know it.
when they watched at all. do you like movies?
you use their witness.
you have the body?
miggs has been murdered.
every word, starling? every gesture?
"eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
why not, lad?  absolute justice?
you’re jumping, sweetheart...
naw, it's... i mean...
go to manual.
impressive. very nice. let's see paul owen's card.
oh, i'm sorry, i must have made a mistake.
you don't care.
don't even start. i'll be honest, i don't trust you. bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that i want to leave. what can you do about it?
must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
i suppose you have something in mind?
tommy, what happened?
not that young. it's been a long time since you've called me that.
you don't mean it. it's just for show.
mimi, jorgensen, morelli, tanner..... 
i understand sir.  could you slide your shorts down please?
no, no.  he's our only "star" right now.  he'd go crying straight to the press.  he'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  get someone from our staff on his ass. tap his phones.  i want to know everyone he talks to.
as if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. what's he gonna do to me?
he okay?
then they hand me sollozzo.
a story.
good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.
it was just an idea.
the question is, are you?
excuse me, we need to make a call.
i bet you try on my coffin some day -- i hope it "fits just perfect."
i was in new hampshire.  i was at the old location.
mr. zavitz was in trouble.
have the car painted.
they're my team, too. i grew up on boyleston street. right by fenway park. i went to fifty or sixty games a year. all by myself. i was one of those kids with scabby elbows. i called out to the players. `look over here. hi, i'm steven. my parents are divorced.'
why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
it's the last house on the left. she lives downstairs.
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  i'm making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
strong enough to get you down the aisle?
what shall we do?
between...
yeah. he says that i will become a monster in two days. what do you think?
you wrote the damn thing, mank aren't you going to fight for it?!
ohh, right. would you like a soda?
i'll never forget you as long as i live, sergeant.
yah?
evelyn?
smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
pig died.
i have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  bu sometimes - uh - i speculate - uh - i haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
mm - hmmm...
it's paradise.  that's what it is. paradise.
he's here, isn't he?  do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
tell them we're working for the university.
exactly! today’s my day. tomorrow will be my day. and the day after that? my day.
what?
client. got a private jet over at butler aviation... dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
thank you.
ruiz tied in out there?
yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  the suit.
-- who's married to --
...oh, did that hurt?
very good, mrs. peel ...
anything.
it is called 'the hawaiian blue' and there are only seven left. in 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
eighty proof. what d'ya say? think you can handle it?
i don't want him hurt...
that's the red ball alarm.
i just wanted to, i don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since i don't remember much of it --
-- you can and you will, mr. carter.
no, he won't.  there are two things you need to know about cornwallis. first, he is a very proud man, he would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  if you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
they'll do nicely.
funky little house, ain't it?  friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. if you need me, i'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, i'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, i'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
the admiral's son.
mr. ola's just leaving, kay. please tell the senator i won't be a minute.
yeah. right. all the things that make life worth living.
oh, hello.
yeah? you and what army?
what?
see you later.
oh, yeah, you know about that? hmmm, that's a strange one.
and the point is?
yes.
i think i might have.
we're going to friends now, sir.
what's this?
neither are we.  something's wrong with the game, mr. difford.
you're smart, lilly, and you're good-looking. you won't have any trouble finding a job.
who do you think you are, ford? the tooth fairy.  kill!  kill!  kill!
tell them that's impossible. i need my normal lead time.
don't be
we were suite mates.
let it.  haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
with all due respect, bill, i'm not asking your permission.
you gotta get a grip on, brother. you gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till i get back. try and stay here, keep your door locked. don't talk to anyone. we just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
a word of caution, sire: we all remember what happened to robespierre, danton and marat. put the marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
i'm going to throw up.
gave them the day off....
aw, come on, bill.  it's just business.
hey, i'm so sorry i'm not the stud that you are.
i don't wanna be in bloody school!
you too.  i just...i can't get it on for good guys. y'know?
i'm homesick.
you just keep an eye out.
los arcos. was a little girl kidnapped recently? about twelve maybe?
yes.
who!
you want to know what you are doing here?! you are love pumping. you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. you are walking the walk. this is it fisher, the real stuff. you love this woman. love is second to nothing. i love you. i love moore. i love micheal. this car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. nothing. we will do what it takes. whatever it takes.
i would have been laughed right out of xenia.
ooohh, nothing.  i just got fired, that's all.
not exactly.
have him meet me with pictures of lecktor's books...
the l.a. river?
and my dad? any word on him?
just smack her now.
can't you see i'm praying, goddammit?!
yeah, sure.
with all due respect, the enterprise is a disaster. there must be other ships in the quadrant.
same here.  so why'd you come tonight?
i do.  i do want to.  that's why i'm leaving.  that's what you given me, see? i know what i want now.  i want a guy like you for real.  not because you buy me things and give me money.  the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. you gonna give me that?
look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
i don't agree. just because he's often difficult --
don't worry about it.
but i...
thirteen years...
deal.  thanks.
that's fuckin' combat.  the man in the black pyjamas, dude.  worthy fuckin' adversary.
it was just the complications. i mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. i mean all the guys had it.
yes.
my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead.
the outlets.
no, no, no. we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
no cops.  i've got a warrant out. mail fraud.  they'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
not quite. i envy the hair- line.
all right.  it was...
he can shoot!  he can hold his ground!  he can attack!  you're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
oh really.  that's nice.  you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  are you out of your fucking mind??  are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
yes.
what's that book you've got there?
i am see-threepio, human-cy...
thanks, harry.  know anything about colson?
thank you for seeing me.  i hear your wedding day is near.  you must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
he's a total asshole... he doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
it was in his bureau.
what's it to ya?
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences. goddamn it! even nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
i'm afraid we may need more than that. there's a bird of prey on the lookout for us. and she can fire while she's cloaked.
twenty.
australia.
ben likes to be read to.  do you know dr. seuss...?
courtyard?
this is horrible!
nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
yeah, i bet it looks crispy in the dark.
can i get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
i know you're not surprised i'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
how's this for a fact?  i loved her first.
yes. i'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
come on, daddy-o. you haven't said a word since we started. least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
but it's not like real work. this is just babysitting.
what happened?
you mean, the insurance frammis?
i want mine to wear glasses.
we never had a problem with that before.
yes, giron! chairman of the board of colet and company. honorary president of the orphans' asylum. adolph j. giron--distinguished citizen! ... well, shall i call the police?  i see! you have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. but when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "call the police! put him behind bars! lock him up!" 
god knows.  anything.  contacts.  clues.
he is that.
he must've unsealed the room!
oh jesus! 
it was just the ether, wilbur...

if it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
you romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone i know?
why?  i just read your report card.  what's the point?  stay home, watch some television, we'll get "mad" magazine delivered.  what kind of report card do you call this?!
no, i don't think so, sail. i just need to lie down.
'68.
no, lover. i'll see what you can do.
nobody's been talking to nobody. you don't have a case, you hear me? it's pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?
so there you are. what do you say?

the story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
i'm fine. nothing.
i'm sorry.
turn it off....
oh, thank you.
you lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? and you didn't get to know him any better than that?
why?
some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
i know the difference.  you were in lompoc usp, the federal penitentiary. i've delivered people there.  so basically you've spent half your life in prison.
too bad. the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
ya know, entry level!
the english won't wait.
exactly.  you understand that, don't you?  you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
what the hell's the matter with you?
that's thinking.  now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  he's...that's what i... that's thinking! "who?  who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
maneuvering thrusters, sir.
then what will you say?
that was an accident! jesus christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? why didn't you listen to me!
nothing.  look, i want to talk to you about...well...luke said to ask you...
maybe.
you're no good
well, i believe there are at least 30 guns at sablons.
deirdre?  smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
i'm not avoiding you. i've been very busy and . . . i like you . . . i really do.
perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can't he right, can it?
terry, no, no... .
how much are your rooms?
come on, don't front like that. you'll put a guy right off you.
i'm right here.
it sure isn't the fun-fair.
you think we're going to be chased?
look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. i am a trustworthy person.
one of cleroe payne's boys?
what went wrong?
about three.
thanks again for your help!
find a new job.
ow!  whatever it is, it hurts.
-- planet. i mean, you were there. do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
you know you shouldn't leave your tv on so loud when you go out.  that creep down the hall phoned the manager.
don't tell me boston is different from new york.
you stole it?
"beloved husband". "beloved wife". what can all that mean?
and you must be mr. massey.
no. i mean, i don't believe it. lilly is not a suicide. i know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
ah, yes... the code. it's a riddle, actually. some fancy of 3jane's. unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences. now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
he shot the chancellor's dog, didn't he? the blind one.
you know, there's no reason for panic.  i just want to rule out some things.
the ship -- out of danger?
no?
uh, i didn't write any songs. you guys go ahead. i gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
not really. i'd forgotten how long it's been since i've done this. and i couldn't get any parmesan cheese.
i -- what are you?!
this is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
right.
understood, my lord.
mr. soze will be most -
she's got nothing to do with this.  let her go.
when you were so depressed after you shot mr. garrett jacob hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  and why shouldn't it feel good?! it must feel good to god. god does it all the time!
charlie, i thought i knew everything about you.
just let me sit here for a moment? iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
ssssh!
in case <u>who</u> checks?
then where is everybody? i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. we ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to mr. blonde or mr. blue. they could both be dead or arrested. they could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. i mean, that could be happening right now. as we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
but i won't give you up to any nobleman.
did you and your sister often take naps together?
miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. if you'd only seen her, miss connell. she looked so pretty.
they found the getaway mercedes a parking garage north of venice. it checks out.
quarter mile away.  we see the lights...
good lord, what do we do?
jack?  jack?  do i look like a jack?
oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, marty. that one for you was a real lunatic. how'd you make out?
i was lookin' at it.  i saw you, man!  jesus!  you oughta see yourself!  you wouldn't believe it.
is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
yes.
why don't we see a movie?
make love to me, 'nine? i want you to make love to me. please, please make love to me.
'cause they're getting a divorce.  that's why they sent me here.  my sister's at tabor.  they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
i'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. more qualified. goddamn phony.
absolutely nothing.
you're the guy killed dutton.
get lost.
i don't even know you.
miss harrington's resting, mr. dewitt. she asked me to see who it is...
omar, listen to me--
if there's one ideal the federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. from the first time the vulcans came to earth we've sought a future of peace. nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. in time. when trust has been earned.
why don't you blow me, chief.  after your girlfriend gets through.
there's something buried there.
aye.
about two years before.
i can't remember.  i've got to make some money.
i don't care what anybody calls me, joe. long as it ain't to dirty. and if you fellas get together every year and say, "charlie, we still want you to run things for us", i ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
lewis gilbert.
i don't know
was.  divorced.
i've robbed just as many banks as you have! i know this town, and i know this bank, and i say it's an easy job.
the one he kept in his right hand. yes, you remember.
i know he's got a paira kings. he don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
how do you do, mr. mccord. we're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a ms. betty...
first principles, clarice. simplicity. read marcus aurelius. of each particular thing, ask: what is it, in itself, what is its nature...? what does he do, this man you seek?
it is for me too.
compensate!
take care, dad.
captain rhodes and his red coat bees. they could sting, sister. we know you came up against 'em. we been watchin' you since you landed. couldn't help. i'm sorry for that. we ain't supposed to be outside. if we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
no.  what house you work?
whatever our name is.
for the moment.
don't worry sid i'd never leave you like that.
because that's where the fire is?
no thanks, i've still got those. well, i'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn. it'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. remember, bruce, it must be certified.
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
but why?
it's vichyssoise, sir.
what is this interest you've got in her?
what?
so what if i don't?
we can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
that's a good idea.
i...i...
well, as my mother says at sunday dinner, "come and get it," bitch!
bourne?
let's try and get these ropes loose. we've got to get to marcus before the nazis do!
mrs. blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
yes. no one has ever had so much, been so close. we must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
tonight's the night?
it's a civilian facility.
thank you.
i have just come from the palace. the post has been filled.
yes.
don't be ridiculous.
uh-hunh.  one of thirty or so, all over the planet.  they're completely automated.  we manufacture them, by the way.
besides, i don't want to be what you want to make me.
i'm not a gambling man.
been to the boat show.
terminate with extreme prejudice.
you mean travel by ourselves?
who is it?
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way.
looking for a job.
he's busy being dead.
yeah, you don't want to tire him out, doctor.
i – mr. lipnik –
but you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
so you dropped by to apologize?
baby didn't die.  just froze off all it's finger and toes.  just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  but the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  now she died.
the same as jane mckenna.
well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. but, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much american identity... we, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... but we'll keep on top of it, mr. president - we'll come up with the answer.
hey --
have you decided about pilgrim?
i have a better suggestion. let's forget that the telephone ever rang. i never heard that you are yakushova... you are ninotchka... my ninotchka...
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
glass or bottle?
her dog, yes.
i'm asking you.
don't bump me.
i beg your pardon?
it's not picasso i'm calling about. it's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
well, i got some good news and some bad news.
lemme down, bugface!
look diane, i'm sorry, but i can't allow you to leave the country without going to valhere's graduation party.  this gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the lakeside rooster, and he,
i hate to disappoint you -- i mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
you waiting for me to say something?  what sort of thing do you want? look, i'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
he'd know it from articles he's read about lecktor...
did it yesterday.  franks and beans.
he seems to be headed for topanga.
no?  what do i act like?
she did like you, she helped and trusted you! you paid her back by trying to take bill away!
well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english.  you see, my dear jeanne... as it is written in the bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
oh my god.  you bought it.
no.
stan?! you started la resistance?
no.
i was just...
you still haven't figured it out, have you?   you think that i've put you through an ordeal.  my scars run so much deeper than yours.
why, how industrious.  and how did you open protected files, may i ask?
he doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
that's it. that's the end.
shhhhhh.
he grins wolfishly.
you don't have to answer everything i say. just listen to me. okay?
whatever you do, don’t mention italy. or politics. or baby buggies.  or edith piaf.
bonjour?  monsieur?  allo...
goddamn right, that's right.  guys come on: "oh, the blah blah blah, i know what i'll do: i'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
a little of this, a little of that.  mostly i tell fortunes.
the hell he did. look, i'll see you in the morning.
of course.
eric...
right.
i haven't had a chance to think. first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there. and after we got away, i've just been dealin' with him.
i live in a one-bedroom apartment. what exactly does your husband do?
i don't know, shit.  maybe she was looking for love...
i've done this.  i've had to do this.
i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
put the gun down, please, boy.
yes.  i'm dr. venkman and this is dr. stantz.
hanukkah, shmanukkah. it isn't even one of the high holidays. what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl.  i'll make you a deal. i'll help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai.
of course you wouldn't. the rembrandt wouldn't fit.
i don't believe it.  you're a romantic, frank.
well, in my prayers, i realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  god would never allow anything like that to happen.
oh my god!
if they break or something. what is it, plastic?
patience.  concentrate.  you will find a way.
i've felt that way, yeah.
granted.
who do you want to speak with? nobody's here.
ask them.
when was the last time you took one?
mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
begin what?
cool, huh huh.  hey beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
what -- what do we do?
'yes. you're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
lori, don't you understand?  i feel i was meant for something more than this.  i want to do something with my life.--i want to be somebody.
i thought you were going to let this one through.
look, what i'm trying to say --
that's normal. god accepts your anger. he won't punish you.
he said the tower, but he's on comb bluff?  frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the douglas shaft.
have you got your checkbook handy, mr. cross? i've got the girl.
take the subway.  we need the car.  hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
alan-one...
i wonder so many things about her now.  why she never told me about you...  funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
yeah, i know.  this is it, isn't it?
i have a suggestion. why don't we take a break.
rejected, worthless, miserable.
like you said, just gotta know how to handle 'em.  old fred wasn't up to it.  we know that we're doin', wyatt.
a dollar seventy and i'm gonna keep it!
damn a, it's o.k. with a bit of luck i'm goin home. what we got?
where's the lady who brings the soda?
the old man said, 'maybe your friend should give in.'  and when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. not only should you quit, you should run!
edie, down here it's every man for himself. it's keepin' alive! it's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
he isn't safe up there. if you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
yeah, it's stupid.  put it on, or i won't teach you.
if he thinks he's man enough.
he was wearing a suit.
what makes you so sure?
which way did she go?
morning after?
you no-good pup!
off a girl's wrist. a suspect...
look, i'm stuck on the freeway. i think there was some big accident. it could be a little while so i don't want you to start freaking if i don't get there at exactly,  eight thirty.
you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
if i go to jail...?
nothing's been boring since you found me.
actually...  that's what i been askin' myself.
maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. we'll try combinations of those letters...
wait! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent.
yeah... look, thanks for talking. i'm sorry i woke you up.
oh --
freddie drove me back in his car.
you said the <u>bad</u> news...
no!!!
what are, what are you doing? look, tim, just go home. alright. go home and sleep it off.
go!! just go!!
i don't know why she'd pick him over you.
seriously, you're amazing. you have everything going for you.  you're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. you're everything i want in a girlfriend.
you know, nothing special.
serves me right for not being musical.
heard you got remarried! congratulations. didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
i'm not sure about this.
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
all right-so we can afford it.
no. i couldn't do that. i have something for you.
well, bye. she laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
my what?!
he's under a tract house in san berdoo.  and he don't smell too good.  what happened to the heroin, johnny?
banzai.
first, let's get something straight. we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. if you want to kill yourself, mr. case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
excuse me?
you're going to blow everyone away.
it's bob's, the day manager's.  he's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
... have a look.
okay.
yeah, well, you and koko kin handle it without me.
do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? come on, it's grad night. you've got your whole life to be uptight.
i know!
you know.
i am afraid of nothing.
everything's fine.  i'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
the dark inside me.
pal, she's a big girl, you know? i'm sure she's alright.
of course.  i don't want to scare you off.  not before i'm finished with you.
half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  know why?  'cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  i don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. he don't have no friends.  who's gonna like a creep like laplante? i was doin' him a favor on the tv outta kindness, and he screwed me. you know what color skin you get on my set, miss gayley?  purple! that's what color skin you got on the tee vee laplante sells me!
i didn't follow you.
but sean said...
neither do i, baby.
he also said we'd avoid that storm in space. and we know how that turned out.
goodbye, darling!
yes.
i think it's starting again. you know... there was something peculiar.  if only i knew...
where are you going?
that's who you were, you don't know who you are.
thought you had a man for that.
any historical figure.
what's that?
i said don't worry about it.  i'll get one of my kids to fix it.
i would imagine that we are, now. i think i'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
did you change your hair?
clear and open on my mark. three... two... one... mark.
yeah, well, van ryan got his.  i don't imagine he gives a shit now.
i doubt it.
i care a great deal about him, yes.
what?
no no no no.
university and 10th--want to carry my books?
beaumont ain't going nowhere.  where do i sign?
he doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
you have another choice.
you got it.
not at all.
what d'ya mean?
always in a rush.
i know you do. don't you disappear.  you do whatever you have to, to hold on...  i'll tell you one more thing... when pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what i think?... i think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... that's what i think.
whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. you give them money. but if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
i'm cool.  i'm cool.
everything human don't have to look like you and me....
well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "i don't believe you, sir..." and all that. yeah, it was gear.
that bitch? no.
who told you?
no.
trust me...
i'm the one they'd be looking for.
would i get paid?
mind if i have a look?
frank's a good man.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. and i'm not saying that's wrong. i'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. he's been to my house for dinner. as a matter of fact i did some free consultation for "mike" -- that's not his real name. that's in my book.
no, not really.
we'll turn back anytime you want.
all right. get him.
you want there to be one... that doesn't...
it looks good, sir. we've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
oh, my love  you ran from me before.
pierce meets people.  sue came on the bus with dreams of hollywood.  this is how they turned out.  thanks to pierce, we still get to act a little.
but to the victor belong the spoils.
sounds all stress related. your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. you don't seem hairy to me. is that all?
up one kilometer, jay.
i know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
not so fast yllo! there's a protocol here.
this wasn't the deal! the deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a mafia war.
now what is this talk about joining the army?  eh?
how long have you been married?
hold on.
let's remember how i got into this. "please, eddie, do this for me. i can't get a break." 
what's it called?
that involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
[aside to gregory] is the law on our side, if i say ay?
get a six-pack of something imported. it's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. if they got fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. i'm fuckin' starvin' to death. are you hungry too?
can i trade in my car and take another?
hello, is this elaine?
he'll learn.
he was adopted you know.
but i'm afraid of--
his home number.
i do the research.
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
you see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
i just gotta get somethin'.
i must go. i'm in a hurry.
anything *better* to offer?
it's bad enough that you are.  it's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
i'll speak to you soon
we've just lost cabin pressure.
hi.
this is the police, ma'am.
finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  we don't even know what it is.  what did we steal?
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
you never looked better in your life. as soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, lovey.
and i'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  a bigger fool than i was.  i been lookin' for this one all my life, johnny.  now i got a chance to step out at the top.
ha!  that's the best part. i can't!!
you can't just stay out half the night and carry on, jeffrey. there's got to be some order, jeffrey. i thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
that's not a question.
would you, tell the guy, get the a.d., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, i want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  you want...
you're very direct, mr. felson.
couldn’t nazi hunters do the job?
yeah?
i'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  and i'm in a position to negotiate.  what about your husband and your child?
peter, are you okay?
i'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
so what do you want me to do? concannon's going to try the case his way, i'm going to try it mine. you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. i'm going to win this case.
what are you in for, willie?
but i thought me and dolores had something.
shhh. slow down, bob. drive natural.
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there's nothing supernatural about greed. and that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
at pennycuik.  i know the inn.  i can be there in an hour.
i don't know... i just think maybe i'm making a mistake...
thank you.

don't be scared.  this time i'm right behind you if you fall.
hey bud! finger here.
a little business move i made.  on my own.  i think you're gonna approve.

our saviour...
no, thank you.  goodnight.
your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!

i deduced it. once you walked in.
quantum is up thirty-five.
i beg your pardon.  li mu bai and i aren't cowards.
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
you're right.
i'm surprised he bothered with it.
and what next?  popcorn?  curtain calls? this is not a theater.  or a casino.
i see without seeing. to me, darkness is as clear as daylight. what am i?
no.  get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
on the men, in the room, arguing about the illegal alien, schumann in the b.g.
i don't get it.
i don't care what you've got started. do you want to go?
watch me.
you can't come in here.
football!
that is highly irrelevant to this case, your honor.
maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
was mrs. dickson there?
sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. the evidence of every scam we ever pulled. the evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
sure. but i took out a whole grocery store.
oh.
...then you rip my clothes off. then we rip lyndsey's clothes off. i think i've got it.
good luck.
don't worry, sir. i have the perfect one.
laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. crushed all the nerve endings. junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
he said he would be there with bells on.
you get recognized, convict, you get a country-western funeral.
shhhh! just like your mama, always scared of things...
don't yell at me, pal.
exactly.  besides, no hard feelings.  you found somebody.  i found somebody. i thought we could double.
i'm tired, hector.  i know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
out of here.
wait a minute. let me see that. she hands him the file.
exactly.  no reason.  no occasion. it just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  how come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
no.  no, it's ok.  i ... it's my father.
damn it!  they'll sink this rig just like a boat!
all of 'em?
who's chest?
all the men at court are without poetry. if they look at me they see my father's fortune. i will have poetry in my life. and adventure. and love. love above all.
that cop!  why'd you have to do that?  you couldn't wound him?  the guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
no, i - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
i'm tired of fighting back.  i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
listen.  "studsy" burke told me you used to be o.k. that's why i'm here. do  they....
the book! the black book they found at hamunaptra! imhotep wants it back. said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
don't get strong, donnie. this is making sense, this making a lot of sense. you are not doing the job, the job i ask you to do, a job i give you. over and over and over and i'm sorry. but i'm not gonna say i'm sorry that much more.
at breakfast.
you get me out first.
that's very nice of ted, but i'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
great.  i love the bahamas.
i'll bet that old mustang's pulling into new york right now.
let's go outside and talk.
no.
you're looking good.    a little thin, but good.
you know what? go with him. just go with him.
no. and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal's done. we've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
as soon as i get to the bottom of this, i'll get the next plane.
what are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? heroin? what the hell do you do with heroin?
we didn't abandon you, pete, we just thought you was a toad.
you still didn't have to choke me.
flew?! oh, come on benny...
none of your business.
get in the car.
the successes obtained are the results of those methods. one presupposes the other and vice versa.
what? why?
really?  i don't work with violent cases, i work with children.  but even a kid lies.  they love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  don't you think stargher would do the same?
we can't leave without you!
how are the lessons going? ada nods enthusiastically. he's getting on all right? ada nods again good.
call me ritchie, miss fagina. may i call you alotta...  please?
just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  the type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  to connect tubes to his genitals.  to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  he's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
oh, yeah.  oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
it's not bad.
i'm not sure i believe. but then i had no one to instruct me. i had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
behave!
not chopped up.  not chopped up like that.  i mean, what do i got left? coupla articles.  a medal or two. plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
she won't be here for a half hour. think you can stand it that long?
no.
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.
fifty shillings.  pounds.
that's not the point. frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. no. no, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
we'd be the first!
what?
of course.
gimme.
i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel.  all i need is some money for the room.
i wish paul luck.
i said.  i serve the queen.
don't i always?
sometimes we have to improvise.
no.  on the phone.
i won't be a moment.
he's not a man, he's a god.
no...
terrible! nothing terrible about her. she's great! marvelous youngster! got a mind of her own. knows just what she wants.  she's not going to get it though. she won't get very far. has no money.
don't fake me out, clark.  or whoever you are.
you're lucky i am not wasting you.
what, darling?
about what?
excellent.  couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
yea.
oh jesus...!  i'll make some coffee.  they left the stove.
move slow and move quiet.
-- then you don't need me.
your parents met her.
the wrong kind! there isn't any wrong or right kind. opera is opera!
well, you aren't the president, dear.
i don't get the distinction.
turn the light on.
he's dead, you know.
okay... about this whistle-blower... did mike and don go along with the corporate decision?
you want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
how much am i paying?
i wasn't always like that.  i don't think i was.
you're going to the soho grand hotel, right?
never heard of the place.
what were you dreaming about?
huh?
what?
wrong preposition...
yep.
eight and twenty-four!  how'd we ever win 8 games?
i'll be all right. you just do as i say.
oh, and my pace is more librarians.
just a few more minutes, then we can go.  take her, will you?
i don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. i don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. in fact, to be very frank, mr. mitchell, i don't think i like you.
that's spectacularly unfair.
sheila?!
doug, nobody tried to kill you.
i knew what he wanted, and i didn't want any part of it.
it'll bleed.
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  people have a lot of free time.  they like to gossip.
thank you, ma'am,
don't push it. you better watch your ass with these fed types. if there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
did you remove anything in the cellar!
it concerns his future!
okay.
yeah? what happened?
milo! what about --?
no no no no no no no no no find me the money...
willy -- hit the lights.
excuse me, my lord.  norris-newman, of "the standard", my lord.
heather.
you met her family? they gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
i'll be sending you on a report tonight.
well, i guess i'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
you're making things up, frank.
up on the right.
i should be trying to stop you.
thank you for being kind enough to lie. you see, i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. you're hired. any questions?
i beg your pardon?
i haven't heard an official "no" yet.
well, yeah.  now.  that's not good.  <u>okay</u>:  <u>okay</u>.  we'll set up the war room <u>here</u>...
what a joke...
yes.
what is it with you litterbugs?  is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
yes, i've seen it.  and i have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
oh yeah.
why don't you try letting her in, steve – i mean shenge.
yes, i thought my wife...
hell, i've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
okay. fine. understood.  i'm off then.
if i let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  they just won't come on the bus, that's all.
it's my favorite.
damn it. i was in the veteran's out- patient program. he knows me.
oh, as bad as that, huh?
yes.
let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
i'll go down the line, kayo, believe me.
we're not on the pier yet -
that's too bad. i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
well, this weekend john was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and i started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
david?
then why did you come here?
i want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
noooooooooooooo!
hollywood.
yes.... yes...
yes.
i think i've heard that before.
is there anything that can stop it?
get behind the shield! i'm about to release radiation!
details, baby, details.
well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
if they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
no... no, i don't think that's necessarily true.
ten million dollars. ten mi -- you cheapskates! i've just wiped out the stock market. i've cost you billions!  i want ten million and one.
like it? it's magnificent!  not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. especially around dinner time.
shut up, hippy.  bud, how you doing?
well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  but i am happy to meet you anyway. i'm sylvia van buren.  i teach library science over at usc.
then what are you saying?
kiki -- he won't hurt you. there's nothing to be afraid of.
i thought we already had this out? next year, if your grades are high enough--
tonight i'm feeling lucky ..
let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
why, brad?
try the car.
two.
like hell. play the goddamn tape.
i've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch t.v., whatever. just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. i never need them all anyway.
i know, i know--i have that dream all the time.  we're almost home.
fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
don't ask him about work, charlie. life's too short.
sure –– sam wainwright.
we sure don't aim to cause any trouble... yeah, she seems to grow on you.
you want us strapped, don't you?
no, icky, this is real.
i 1ove you, rowan.  i've always loved you.  i only wanted to be in your thoughts. to bring myself into your thoughts - so i could be as we are now.
your daughter needs you.  go.
heaven knows. a lot.
a few friends... just a little dinner party.
stacy, did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb? or john grant?  do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
a miracle is an event without an explanation. if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
or what? you've gone round the bend --
peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>i'll</u> show you an idiot!
i don't tip because society says i gotta. i tip when somebody deserves a tip. when somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. but this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. as far as i'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
the extortion, the threats ...
i have to...
but, you know, so what?
look.  i didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  what was i supposed to do? i had the pianos anyway.
until he's old enough to read.
i'd put my money on that vigo character.
fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. he just wanted to fix their cars.
we walk.
yes, sweetie...i heard you.  so! i'm ready for you, meine liebe.
we're getting married. she said she could tell i was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
ooooohhhh!!  of course! the father! forgive me!!  can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  everything has been so awful!!
it's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  things like this. i'm really only now finding out myself.
mulet.
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
yes! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut!!  i am sorry young man, but i have had it up to here! strap them in!
no -- i worked too far north for lrrp.
so i'm sorry.
what are you going to do?
don't spend too much time searching. you ever vetted somebody's old code before?  it's a different skill. stay close to the surface. the best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. you know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  in a tree.
with pleasure, captain.
your home address is 18 thornton avenue, coventry.
jah guides us.
i do renounce them.
yeah. you're a mystery. i like you. very much.
sam?
what'd he get?
yeah, eddie was a real character.  had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes.
i'll remember that. what do you do?
it's better than shovelling horse shit.
all you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
of course.
well, er... no.  i mean, you don't look like dragons i've heard of.
ya got a good mind for dates.
what about him...?
wait -- wait -- you can't go anywhere -- i gotta go with you --
i think he saved my life.
no, no. the three hundred is for you doing it to me.
i'm sorry.
here's to ed.  for making us into something.
i like it.     but headlines are better.
oh, my god, he's a natural.
but you may quote me as follows. quote. tonight miss margo channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which i have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. unquote.
why, because you're my security consultant?  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
this is clean shit.  no serial numbers and never been used...
give me that.  i'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
the only thing that scares me, mister o'connell, are your manners.
he's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  he's taken money from little old ladies.  he's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  especially me.  but who has he really hurt? 
that's what i keep trying to tell him.  you're so money, you don't even know...
right, slow...
hmm, as in -- that's interesting. sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
there's only so much technology can do.  thanks for the beer.
athos, my friend!
i'm not sure.  you mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
you don't want to be at crossroads without one. it's a charm that old people teach you how to make. i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  in my travels i misplaced it. i have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
just thinking about something.
yes -- i was looking for anna scott...
so she hasn't changed?
that sounds like horseshit.
no, this is gonna work! i just gotta get close enough to talk to her. takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named waldrip.  i'm goddamn bona fide. i've got the answers!
oh, jesus.
must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. how long you been in it?
oh, charles is hardly ever with me. first it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. what do people call you -- pete?
i don't know. i'm lost. i'm scared. i feel like i'm disappearing. i'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
how can i do what i do now?  let's just say i spent a lot of time in the prison library.
actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. it's all quantum physics and molecular attraction.  there are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
what do you want?
yes. ben called me. he wants me to meet the president.
i told them we invaded england.
don't worry honey, i'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
who said i'm not getting recruited?
hitler!
jesus. all right, gimme a magazine. i- 'cause i'm a little tired.  you know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but i'm prepared for anything. an emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. hey, what is this? what? did you go to a rock concert?
how?
good!  leave me alone when i'm sleeping.  i'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
a flare?  a flare won't do it.
y-y-yes--
you've checked that end?
i'm over here?  what's your name, officer?
sure, just watch where you're going.
i am certainly glad to hear it. i know he'll be pleased.
should i call you back?
then what are you doing here?
yes...
forget him.  he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  you need to worry about people like <u>otho</u>.  there are a lot of phony trance mediums.  they usually can't make the formulas work, but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  as in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
because you're tainted. the venom's still inside you. you could still turn on us.
clair, george clair! what the hell brings you to new canaan?
the ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
look, i feel bad about this, so i'm going to try to look into the programming of his maestro teaching tool for you.  ) i've had one sitting around for years. maybe i can learn something that you'll find useful.
what we make it to? the next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
i've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  shouldn't you be in school...?
lis, i want to, i really do, but... oh, i can't.
silence!
no. and nobody knows where she is.
you know how much it is, nick.
oh.
how are you, keaton?
get them out of here. if he says one word, shoot him.
really?
about six and a half million dollars.
yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
well, i've been busy. 
in that little pissant car of yours? hell, no.  i ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- i'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate seiko watch.
it means they hate his freaking guts. it means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
can do.
thing?
it's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
i've never ridden in an automobile.
i'm not sure.
larry brought me flowers last night.
remember - he's your date for tonight. so smile.
listen, jo-jo. does this mean anything to you? joan gale's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
no, and i've been calling all night. maybe he's shacked up.
no, that was in columbia.
who gives a shit! i didn't come here to listen to music! listen up instead of running off at the mouth! the batteries on my phone are almost gone.
maybe the circuit is busy?
what are you doing here?
he alive to see this?
the phone call.  the knapsack.
not directly anyhow ...
i thought she might come along. handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine.
as you wish.
i'm not pregnant. i got my period this morning. there's no baby, sid.
i wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. and i wondered if i could wait that long.
you gotta be kidding.  you dragged me out of greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  you couldn't get anybody else?
her husband.
that's right, you have the right to remain silent.
is that how you play?
yes. samuel! we're going.
gee guys, that's swell of you. but  . . . i've got another idea.
oh, no--you're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
just remember - you're a target.  don't you think vince has a t.v.?
...i was just talking to that girl in the other room.
what was her name?  the one i met.
fine, quincy.
cannon fuse.
no.
i swear to you that's all that happened.  i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
i was with valerie, i swear. this is adrian's work. i've got to find him.
i must say, you look more your old self --
we got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  materials which disappeared from dr. lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
you love walks.
it's frogs.  it's raining frogs.
claire.
donde vamos? [where are we going?]
can you not go yourself.
yes.
where's the place to go tonight?
why, i love my father because - because i do. of course, he's nice to me.
there's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this catwoman prowling around. we can always dine at the mansion, if..
why didn't you say anything?
marv,  ...i just bagged the elephant!
about the baby.
no police!  wait until i'm gone.
i don't get it.
i know daddy. i'm worried about him.
nice doing business with you, george.
no, jack, i never got married. you?
no, she said she had a son.  in a dream she once called life.
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom, said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all.
so, how's it going today?
dear me... i must be losing my finesse. if i'm not careful i'll be understood by everybody.
he's a worm - and i'm gonna step on him!
not exactly, but i want to be one, like you.
to code?
tell me about it.
he's my contact for chrissake! there's two crates. can you get me into the hospital?
you must leave this house.
where the hell is it?
what for?
goddamn you, joe, don't make me do this!
i got it ta my head now. i got it ta my head now.
no, ma'am, i'm afraid that's extra.
connections? i have no connections, only favors. if i call to help victor, a general will think "paul rusesabagina is a fool. he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." then my hard work is doubly squandered. i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all. please leave these things to my good judgment.
it's a coincidence.
please ... we are doctors.
oh really? i didn't know that.
dignan, i --
if you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
where? where did you find it?
i don't see it like that at all.
yeah.
a) it's always the person you don't suspect; b) that means you think it's tex because you really suspect gideon; therefore c) if you think it's tex, it has to be someone else -- gideon.
no, mr. conway, i'm not lying. what reason could i have for lying? the chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but i'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
sid?
i need to get something straight first.
who remembers.
huh ... i don't know.  they got howard johnson's there.  i don't know why the fuck i'm going there for.
pro! release the rope!
gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
you mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
this tie doesn't go with blue!
i see. i've suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?
well... many things. but i think the thing i love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. it's really quite a thrill when that happens.
i gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
what if they serve soup?
with me.
well, i'm only trying to get you outta this.  i told them you were in vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
you like her?
i could use some recon photos too.
whatever you need, i'll be there.
yup. that's me.
mine.
yes.
she's got an army of people to get her up and out.
no. this time it's true. i didn't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out.
he's right, wyatt.  ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him.
och, you do, fergie.
that would definitely explain it.
no, but i'm the best.
we ain't goin' nowhere.
well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. lists of people we have to write to. find mama's relatives addresses in italy -- stuff like that.
you had left me! i kept silent out of rage.
naw.  i bet'cha it's something better than air.
why?  what's wrong with me?
yeah.
that one was for you. but i thought i'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here. i'd hate to lose you, ethan.
i told you everything. you might as well just kill me right now.
that's mad.  surely you don't take their word?
what?
where's the rest?
because he was a <u>real</u> hero, chucky. he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  he didn't expect the media to lionize him.  he didn't expect a million dollar reward. he saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante....  for how much, laplante?  a couple of bucks?  did you give him enough for a decent meal?
i got eighteen dollars, dude.
fuck you, man! where's jerry? i gave simple fucking instructions -
not yet.  i had a phlemless morning.  i hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  third platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when third platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. we'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. it'll be a massacre!
random, sure.
i was thinking i could fly up and spend a week in the big leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
you rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
there's not much illegal.
all of these are interviews?
no.
it's yours.
yes, we know that you do.  i have it in my files.  that's at the manhattan health center...
all.
you're not seeing me?
in test... what?
it's practically stamped on your forehead.
... maybe i'll watch it on tv.
they changed the layout.
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak'tahla...
what happened?
....to feel yourself. very well. you are revealed to the world. but still you must keep your secret identity. first of all, you will need it as an escape valve. you cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
ok, how's everything going?
george zipp said that?
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself. otello's is on delle croce, just off the corso.
it's not a boat boat.  it's really a house.
no, they'll do even more. we've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean? starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive. have you thought of this?
don't play innocent with me, thelma.  you know perfectly well what's going on.
in case???!!! in case of what? in case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
you're not ready.
fine.  let's say all you ever knew was apples.  apples, apples and more apples. you might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. then one day there's an orange. and now you can make a decision. do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? that's democracy.
that's your domain.
so what happened since? you're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
...that's what the sister said. the chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
you just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." i'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.

trickery and divinity.
she's with her grandmother. she's with steph's mom. she spends a lot of time over there. steph's... well, she's stephanie.
so this sitter can always reach me.  i'm still not used to leaving him.
screw me?  that can't be right.
oh, is that what this is about? you want to hear that i don't really have any brothers? that i'm a fuckin' orphan? is that what you want to hear?
really.
because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. two hundred ten thousand. that would mean i keep seventy.
i don't have all day.
strong men also cry. . . strong men also cry.
what?
oh, it's not that. it's just that i'm - harmless.
i don't think you really understand --
that's ignorant.

i kind of like it.
the freighter started through at 1:42.  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.
to put it mildly. since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. a hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
miss dawson on the phone, sir.
yeah. you know...hang out.
we should get you to the doctor.
huh?
i was asked by my father to open neg-

i heard the drum and fife yesterday, mac, marching past.  made my hair stand on end.  i thought, i've been asleep for twenty years.
"i want to tell you something, harriet..."
just the same.
he's coming.
thank you very much. but, cliff, that's my seat. and i was just--
i think we may be, yes.

honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
i've told you before. i'd turn it down.
i'll see you tomorrow.
yes.
i am.  are you soliciting for police charities?  the last time, you people called at my office.
i was just tryin' to...to...
eight blocks down in the rue de poivrel.
of course.
we can just take this pillowcase.
what about veronica?
find out what?
i neither enjoy nor dislike. i do what is necessary.
aw, come on jerry. we've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
johnny's c.d.?
but what can we do?... we have to accept.
that will take time.
i know it well, sir.

sir?
yep.
look, now i'm pumping you. i'm sorry. it's none of my business. it's just that you're not like the others.
hurry up, hurry up. we open in five minutes.
only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work.
why me?
you lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
you see? life can be so simple.
dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
the combination is three-ten-forty-four.
right!  ants!  millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
he gave it to me.
eight, nine car lengths. a hundred and sixty-two feet.
what? wha-at? mrs. hillyer?
you got a real big mouth, convict.
a man in love, completely shaken. he sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
we're talking raw, unprocessed kgb files. it's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
can you play it?
don't worry it's okay!
relax.
don't speak!
i am?
hello.
i can't say that!
no.
it grew.
that'll do.
you lie.
take a look for yourself.
we'll adopt some.
i'm not interested in personal publicity. our people know what i'm doing.
yeah, but he still has the aggravation. three days sitting in a cell.
what have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
freezer in the back.
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it.
well i think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. that makes good babies start to grow. and bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. i don't know where good babies come out. and you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
no, that's,..that's fine
don't do this.
bobbie, what are you talking about?
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai?
well, you want to swing by the chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
no. of course not. she didn't do it.
don't be.  wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
i'11 take my chances, thank you. it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
bet they're worth about a million dollars.
no, c'mon, stop playin'. the girl that you kissed when we got there. where s he live at?
it isn't my army yet, colonel greene.  looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
i am with you!
you can shoot him.
what's your name?
i have but one pet cause, today: ban the bat.
i do. goodbye. 
damn near. now i'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised, but you two are going to bed. go on, now, scoot.
"...for my father."
you asked to see me, ma'am?
shut the fuck up or i'll shut you up.
hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
like what?
forget it. what's the point of psych now? tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh.
give me a break.
sure witt! now art thou sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
i'm here at rekall.
nope. the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj-6.
lincoln used it.
i don't know.  i'll go and sort it out today. why don't you come?... we'll find a real room for me. you can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
you want me to put a man on it?
dismiss the company.
that's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. you were dead wrong. we're only interested in one thing: can you tell a story, bart?  can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? is that more than one thing? okay.  the point is, i run this dump and i don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. why do i run it? i've got horse-sense, goddamnit. showmanship. and also, and i hope lou told you this, i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. did you tell him that, lou? and i don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. coffee?
i said i'd check with you.
i didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. i didn't have time to get a window, but i found this key.  pretty nifty, huh?
really!  is it gone?
i don't....
hindsight.  it's like foresight without a future.
int. postal van - day

the army gave you that?
here, take the broom.  the front needs sweeping.
you couldn't be.  look, barry. there's going to be people from laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums.  how are you going to cope with them?
which side are you with?
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats?
the fuck are you talking about --
why didn't you tell me?
not good enough.
well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  it's cold out here, susie.
well... something like that.  i'm sorry. i don't mean to sound so mysterious.
what?!
...i can't wait to be among you.
okay, here's what i think.  we find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in rome, we could narrow it down and--
there's nothing to see. i used to live here, you know.
you didn't say 'symington says'.
norm?
that's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
you're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. maybe we'd better go over the plan again. where are you gonna be at 8:55?
okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. i'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
but how much cash could i bury in my closet, right?
leave!? who the hell do you think you are?

clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.

nellie, get me long distance.  what is it?
i'd love to.
did the emperor or empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
it's one of a kind.
that's what gordon's always saying.
of course.
waddaya talking about?!!
no.
sill? what else would i be working with?
i've got to get back.
i got the paperwork here. partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, i supply professional services, you supply the capital. i'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
crowd control. crowd control. wake up, guys.

a hundred years ago austria was run by a prince named metternich. austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. but they were ruled by passionate men, while metternich was ruthless and brilliant. if one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. he would lead all of europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
yeah, exactly -- "was"!  but now, you're creatively bankrupt.  in fact, ladies and gentlemen, kaufman's so desperate, he paid me to do this tonight!!  i'm a plant. it's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  isn't that true???

i know how it is.  my dad collects miniature canon.
oh.
exactly!
no i'm not!  i'm talking about common, everyday life here.  if you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. in this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.

jinnah has -- has cooperated with the british. it has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly hindu.  that i find hard to bear -- even in prison.
can you take that damn thing off the table.
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
my husband the hero.
what do you mean, sorry?
me? why would i get into that shit?
no, it's okay. i just can't believe i left it out in the open like that. crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? poking around?
-- oh, yes, it's mad.
that's the train with all the lights.
yes sir.
nevermind.  it's not real -- it's a hoax.  a prank.  he's hiding in a barn. hey, turn left here.  left!
oh, come on.
of course not. i couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything i've ever stood for. they know it was an accident. they're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
don't fret, benjie, it's --
here's the deal. you work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. you help us get off this rock....
all right - go to it.
tried him once -
uh-huh.
what i'm trying to say is this is a board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the board.
i don't know, and it could be anything. but i just say we go take a look.
i'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
alexander.
uh... none just now, but...
nick...
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to.  what i'm talking about, i'm talking about murder. among other things.
i could be wrong. what happened anyway?
and?
hang on...  remember that cessna we saw at the pumping station on the haul road?  belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
it's kathryn.
you're my only problem, ed. what does it take to make you go away?
he kicked major ass and you know it.
no!
and where might that be?
first rate, ain't it?
there's no call for that language-
but i'm just trying to leave.
it does, huh?  clark kent, i'd like you to meet lois lane.
mama. i been thinkin' about her. she's prob'ly worried to death by now.
maybe i should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like carlos dominguez - - and get fat and —-
oh, yes. mrs. windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman i know. i have loved her since the day she hired me. she could never do something this awful. i know this because we are very close.
is it awfully violent?
so what?
"i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
shut up!  both of you right now!
in the chest.
i hate when things don't go my way. it makes me so horny.
i know what he'll say.  he'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that i should forget about it.  he'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
alright, ms. paleontologist.  i wanna know why that monster is here.  you got a theory?
wait a second.
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  someone went to a lot of trouble.  try again.
<u>something's</u> in that water.
sure, lana, i'd love to.
maybe not.
yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
w-we had a fight.  i called him... called him a name...
you ask too many questions. you want the surprise or not?
what's the difference?!  it's just somebody i met!
i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
right now your big friend at the diplomat is bleeding fast, martin. he might still possibly survive if attended to soon. and he did cooperate.
c'mon, i might buy a company some day.
i thought that was for when we were very very old?
get your reserve bottle and let's go.
it's an uprising.
i never been to montana... acquaintance of mine has, but i hadn't... never had any reason to.
oh cuervo...
i knew you wouldn't come if i didn't have a map.
uh, yes.
yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
i will?
there's no reason to say that. everyone knows you're going to be well.  i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
jon!  get back!  you don't understand.
i think so.
yes it is, cause then he'll give you all a's and it won't be fair.
sprechen sie deutsch?
how's julie?
don't give me any of that. i know he's been here. you can't fool me, mister.
what?
he didn't come home.
this is just a delay, that's all this is.  all major theme parks have had delays.  when they opened disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
any poop on the john doe you found out there today?
oh no!  uuh.
extraordinary, isn't it?
i'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
yes.
i mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, i--
yes... a man i know took me to switzerland last month...
i'll back that up.
blondes are discriminated against worldwide! brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. if she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "oh, the poor widow."
18k.  crap.
fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
no.
remind me to lodge a protest...
christ, twenty seconds, christ!
ask me in about five minutes.
you've already been fifteen.
you know dr. mason's son, jeffrey mason, don't you, james?  you met him in the county hospital six years ago.
kidding around... you know, fun.
paint a woman in a lighthou--i don't want to steal a horse. life is...
you was in the marines, huh?
they're fuckin' with us.
honey--alcoholics anonymous takes all the time i've got--and harold ryan is an individual i would rather forget.  he drove me to drink.  he drove his first two wives to drink.
--stories... you brought me back. your love brought me back. back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
yeah.  i guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
i don't know... looks like clothes.
hardly ever.
rose, you and brother wait in the car. i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer.
good question. hardly sees anybody anymore. hasn't left this place in twenty years. did you bring some tobacco?
get out of here.
it's two-point-five, george.  i am sure.
hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
now, none of that.  please dig in.
i'm worried about him, he's worried about me, i ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like i'm not supposed to know he's there.  now it's christmas, and you know what happens to people at christmas.
pretend.
did you find out about her parents?
don't give her your name.
had to've done it. no one else was in there.
maybe. recognize this?
from pursuing your chosen profession.
you know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? i move all of those--
nope.  so what'd they find out in there?
hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
i don't mind.
yes?
but where?
dogs?
i'll rephrase the question.  mr. roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
what happened to me?
well, mr. feldman, some people have resumes to show.  i've got my own movie.
dorothy vallens?
i'll try to keep the door open.  if you wash out, i make it so that --
we saw his show at the luxor last night.
he married you, didn't he?
what theater was i at?
aren't you?
my son has been sadly injured. who did this?
sra-i'm-sick! sra-i'm sick!
well... i'm goin' ta bed now.
come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
and you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
okay, you're aerated. to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. there's no switch in avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. there should be five wires, just to your left. do you see them?
i want to go home now.
they run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows some guys in new york, miami, guys he helps get guns to detroit. hides 'em with his regular loads.
easy to say, but hard to do.  for what i am trying to tell you is that i am the governor general of jesuits in france.
yes.
don't fucking humor us.  we're not in the mood.
you go back, i'll walk.
i didn't tell 'em anything.
wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>commander</u>!  it just so happens i'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before i'd risk my father's life...
doesn't matter.  doesn't make one bit of difference.  oh god, george, how'd this happen to me? how'd i end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
i don't have a memory and i'm not a princess!  even if i were - no one's ever going to believe it. i'm not exactly...
what he said. we didn't know jack shit about and riot. it just happened. it was kismet. we didn't even know those people. how are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  i mean, it's not like we care. if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. it won't exactly keep us up at night. but you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
we're running out of smoke.
i think you're in anaphylactic shock --
that's right.
tell me, jody
i don't think so.
two years. ever since we left island.
jesus!  through a window?
what's the bad news?
when i said before that i hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, i was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
hey!
okay, then. put a guard on me. i want you to put a guard on me. because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. right?
shut-up.
my parents are dead.  don't even think of bringing them into this.
some of them are.
we didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
he's allergic.
wyatt...
are you free tonight?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
but, erik...
yeah, cap.  back in narcotics.
was that it?
yes, sir.
what the hell kind of cop are you ?
your slave?
then that's all i have to say. dismissed.
no one seems to know where you live, james. hannah thought you'd like my couch.
you're taking the kids.  and moving to san francisco.
it's written on toilet tissue.  'my dear dr. lecktor, i wanted to tell you i'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. i know that you alone can understand what i'm becoming.  'i know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what i am becoming.  just as the source of light is burning.  mr. graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'i have a complete collection of your press notices.  i think of them as unfair. as unfair as mine. the "tooth fairy." what could be more inappropriate.  investigator graham interests me.  very purposeful looking. i hope we can correspond.  there's another piece missing here. i'll read the bottom part.  'after i hear back from you, i might send you something wet.  signed: avid fan.  it has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
hey, yourself.  i see you’ve met my ex.
nooo!
not very likely.
so that's it? big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till i cough blood?
where does it all get us, grandpa?
do you think you are ready?
"discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  who told you to say that?
yes.  it's perfect, isn't it?
i was gonna...
what are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
i guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
no...! quid pro quo, doctor.
i was going to ask.
yeah.
that's right, jane.  complete vacation.
and if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
and what does that mean?  are you insane?!  you think i would hurt lois?! she's the mother of those kids! what is wrong with you?
because you left, man. she's got her own world to deal with in new york. she was a sweet girl but fuck her. you gotta move on. you gotta let go of the past. the future is so beautiful. every day is so sunny out here. it's like manifest destiny man. i mean, we made it. what's past is prologue. that which does not kill us makes us stronger. all that shit. you'll get over it.
so what did you find.
i wish it had never been invented.
don't talk like that to him!
it'll pass. headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
yes! what are you afraid of hildy? i dare him to move that desk out of here.
hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - i'm outta here.
whooee!
i've never seen you in here before.
thank you... thank you very much.
destruction of their local weather systems. i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air.
he was trying to steal my car!
hi, how'd your day go?
no, the problem, as i recall, was the lack of blocking...
what?
the flags of discontent. it's the only way anything ever gets changed.  don't try to follow us.  i'm pretty handy with things like this.
what past? she has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago.
is that from one of the gospels?
i gotta headache... what's goin' on?
you look awake to me. here.  drink some of this.
i've never sent a letter like that, you know?  i mean, i felt like i wanted to tell you something, but i didn't put it in the letter, and i didn't say it, but i want to say it now, i'm not sure if i should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but i think that i mean it, so, um, i just wanted to tell you...
they're yellow.
what's there to do? you found the sliver.
i didn't even know he had a brother. and where is he now?
why'd you see him so regular?
yah.
you're so easy...
i know something better.
it's taken care of. the less you know about it the better.
you sure?!
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago.
they either say, 'kill the nigger' or 'hope you die, honky.' -- what ya got in the bag?
i have to talk to you.
barnes believes in what he's doing.
they go together.
well. i don't want to play "cora."
you're moving away?  when?
top drawer. maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
not since 1963, since it happened. every kid in haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
i can't, i don't have the men.
now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
patience.  it's time to eat.
it was unbelievable!  un-fucking- believable!
minutes ago.  harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
i'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
hello, jason.  i think i've had a change of heart.
who's there?
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
look out!
we'll take a chance on that, burns.  go ahead, boys. 
okay.
look ... where's this going? what do you want me to do?
i never hurt nobody...
we'll divide into teams. commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem.
what?!  now hold on!  wait one damn minute!
oh, you got a headache!
you resemble a figure from the della robia rondels, in your family's chapel at santa croce.
-- he will.
you ought to get some new ties, stewart.
aw, don't get mushy.
bless you, darling  darling!  are you mad?  you're not wearing a bustle.  how lewd!
you crashed my file?
yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
i like it here...
so get the hell out of here.
you're sure you're reading that right? john doe?
we have to find kittle.
brown, jackie brown.
no, lester.
you believe in the boogey man?
nothing.  just a little project.
mr brown, sir --
if stage two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
you're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
maybe ... ten-thousand.  and that's a maybe.
shoot, jimbo.
no.  ni!  more like this. "ni"!
i didn't have any choice.
we're going to figure this out.  get a grip on yourself.
when joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...well, i guess most of what she said was probably true.  there were a lot of things i didn't understand-- a lot of things i would do different if i could.  just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change...but we can't.  some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  joanna says she loves billy.  i believe she does.  so do i.  but the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  the only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for billy...when joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, i suppose she's right.  but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  i guess i've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
now don't you worry about that. you just leave it all to me. we won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... i'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... no, sir... not me! ...
i have to. if a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
you do?!
i was eleven years old. when i was strong enough, i dedicated my life to the study of fencing. so the next time we meet, i will not fail. i will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "hello, my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die."
it would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. i mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
how?
what?
so, what are we looking at white?
no.
he coulda been white.
implicitly.
yeah. ma...
oh, no!
where do you think, my idiot friend? we're in a nice filthy cemetery. does this make you happy? is this fitting and proper enough?
tonight. when you get out, we'll go.  why didn't you tell the other detective?
please don't talk any more, charles.
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
that aside for the moment, i'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  in my seven years on this committee, i've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  never.  i'm deeply disturbed by this report, mr. hayes.  not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
that dea agent called again. you don't want to talk to him?
okay.
maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. we heard some explosions out there this morning...
momma, i'm all right, i'm fine, really i am.
electra --
very weird.
i'm a bit of a slob myself.
why are you lying?
will you do me a favor then?
i was looking for him earlier, but...
go where?  where're you going?
i have coffee in the thermos.
the big one.
and what about you?
the money would go to frank.  the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
funny -- you look married.
fine with me.
i want to introduce a couple of people. doc white is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
yeah.
and as treasurer, you could release those funds?
sammy didn't have a wife.
you don't know baby d.
good.
wait -- i want to see the painting.
must have been? used to live? i do live here.
yes.
okay?
i was just going to contact you, michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, i just come from there.
who knows the secrets of the human heart.
bought the bottle, didn't i?  to the united states of america. long my she wave.
oh, i'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
yes, sir.
don't put yourself down like that. i <u>never</u> used you.  i worked my way up like a marine grunt!
if you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, best.
you did?
i didn't touch it.
i have a promise i have to keep first... to an old friend.
nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, zoe.
is it armed?
if i'd known, i'd have fixed him up with something better.
where are you from?
who is lamagra?
i hope i'm not interrupting.
all right, we're lost.  but we're making good time.
if leo comes here, he won't believe that i am out doing the "meals on wheels".
what're you talking about?
i told that woman i'm an orphan.
the truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. and do you know why?  yes, you know why.  your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. asshole ! schmuck ! how long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  except me.
ye-ah. was it... it was yours actually, but, uh, i approved it immediately.
she didn't like me... i made a fool of myself...
these guys make top-notch pinot and chardonnay. one of the best producers in santa barbara county.  look how beautiful this view is. what a day!
it's barry.
yes?
what about tommy?
we'll work something out, joe.
34,000. but they're real short lines. 'just came out that way.
no one yet.
i am a creature of darkness.  i require the shadow's solace and the black of night... sunlight is abhorrent to me... i cover myself completely whenever i venture forth in daylight... sunshine is my destroyer.
next game, ten bucks.
my god, you're serious.
i may have said perhaps...
sure it is.  freckle face, if i ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  i'd catch hell.  and this is the alleged murderer of the president?
good night.
we have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  nobody gets near you.  you're not going any place.
too much school.
fine.  why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
she’ll be alright. she’s tough...
tell me about it...
any id on the shooter yet?
not yet, mister worf.
where?
what's that?
dr. smyslov... i'm not permitted to discuss this.
this goes out live?
gus, if there's anything i hate, it's greed.
i've...look.  will someone get this guy off my back.
two more charges to go.
that's father at work, what'll i do?  peter, what'll i do?
it doesn't take this.
there are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
by the way, i left some trash in your locker.
got it.
it's okay.
i don't know.
how are you, travis? i read about you in the papers.
it bit me! my leg! jesus, it's down there, shoot it! shoot it for christ's sakes!
good.  now take the forceps, and remember, vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  i've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  there are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
make your mind up.
i wish to be your husband.
what about job?
the borg.  some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
i do?
of course i will.
really?
are you sure?
your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  and the report is accurate...?
you gotta go, r.l.. i ain't foolin' this time.
it's a beautiful country. very clean. very civilized. and cold.
yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
paris.  there is still much to do. we'll be back soon.  be ready.
us.  you mean the watchmen.
i did? i didn't see anything.
that is so true. you're different, chauncey... quite different than most men.
the pleasure is mine.
what a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
how's work going?    are you back at school?
no.
just seems weird they didn't chase us.
going nearer to god!
but you're wrong. i do know you, at least by reputation. edward bloom from ashton. see, i'm actually engaged to a boy from ashton. don price. he was a few years older than you.
ludwig?  he's gay - are you jealous?
i were you, i'd calm down, shelly.
there's nothing wrong with you, lisa. you have the town in the palm of your hand.
open it.
hey, murph.
colonel merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the regular army, a soldier first and a doctor second. a member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's america's god-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the asian mainland.
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
yeah. all week long.
tell the president to adopt. i think i'll like l.a.
because i'd met someone else.
this is it, james...what you've been working for.
the job looks okay to us.  but look at it from his point of view.  the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  but for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
so do i, love.
valentine, listen to me ...
and die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
you could give me the gun.
let's get naked.
anybody else need anything read?
you mean they knew who i was?
okay!
oh, don't be so coy, dear. you're going to rio.
shut up, shut up!  it's beeping.
have they nothing to fear presently?
i came for love...
i'm glad.
she knows not to steal.  i've taught her better than that.
i'll give you a gut feeling, you little... hey... <u>hey</u>!  get that stick out of your mouth.  these things are killers, man.  don't you go to school, listen to smokey the bear and all that...
starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
i said fine.
i'm all right.
but carl was a fisherman.  and successful at it.
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
she's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. might i remind you this was your brainstorm.
please. go. just go.
tastes can change.
that's right you travel so much.
what's the good of another post mortem? suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to harry?
maria... maria mitchell.
i know what you need.
i'd have to see it on.
but the grail ... where is the grail!?
jesus!
i -- i don't know what you're talking about! i -- i haven't time to listen to all this --
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
my back is killing me.
but why? just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
people still watch that?
no, no.
i'd just like to pick up a few of my things
little more juice's all it needs...
you think so, jack? well... i wouldn't want to be in that wally's shoes tonight.
that's us.
i don't know, ryuji said there was a change of plans.
we're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
thank you...  oh no, don't put it on there...
sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  kaufman, people are sick of you.  the wrestling... the hoaxes...
i'll see you tonight.
be patient.
just an atmospheric discharge. nothing to be afraid of.
and how did you get in the school?
just that i'm glad to be here, miss ratched. i really am.
kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
yes--but don't ask me why--because i could never tell you. i don't know what most guys want out of life--but <u>that</u> would be enough for me--i wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--i'd just like to live <u>my</u> life so nothing i did would bounce back and ruin <u>hers</u>--do i make myself clear?
i've seen some sickening shit. i don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
oh.
mrs...
not even a hunch. just hope.
i was educated by nuns.
what's wrong?
hurt!  how?
boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know i'm tutsi.
wait ...
go home!
twenty-five percent.
let the hooker go.  she's not important.
you're society girls?
maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
heeey! totooooo! don't get pissed off with me now! come here! i don't know where the fuck i have to go.  and the next time be careful how you talk. not to take credit away from the lord, but if i had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. but unfortunately such was not the case.
no.  you gonna stay close to me from now on.  so you don't disappear on me.
in the cellar. buried under a stone in the floor.
bonsai!
look, i don't have time to fuck around.  there's somebody out there i don't need to see.  you got a fire escape or anything?
sure i do.  you heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what edvard said.
we talked.
i am afraid, wesley, he has that right.  and i will have to urge him to use it.
yes it does.  the fairy queen told me.
oh ethan!..
she's dead now, too. she was a nanny.
oh, please!
i'm not paid to take your personal calls.  he was in some bar. .. off duty.
it's not a rumor. it's a sale.  if tisch can unload cbs for $81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
<u>this</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
in the grub box.  toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
have them mobilized. i'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. we need to keep israel sequestered in that penthouse.
there've been other cases.  where we've changed results.  pushed witnesses. manipulated evidence.  but dobbs.  i wanted dobbs more than anything.
look at the bottom of the screen. you see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  click on that... twice.
what mr. parker?
well, that's what we're here for.
i fell asleep.
i'm impressed.  but let's use the short form.  i'm looking for --
are you alright?
such as?
no, i ... i was just ... worried about her.
yeah, i would think so, too.
rallying cry, it's an insurrection. seale, that god damned cleaver, where the hell do these guys come from?
go, doctor.
you're going too fast.
normally, i would agree. but in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. you're many things, number one, but you're not much of an historian.
come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, fettes.  take a look at the child.
all the time.
all right -- but listen to me. what happened was there was this party at my parents. i drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
how was the class?
it's a lie!  you're a deserter! you're an impostor, sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
only holds five.
come on, move it!
what d'you say, willie?  tighten her up?
they knew it.  time, distance, nothing could separate them. because they knew.  it was right.  it was real.  it was...
baby, we're money.
dad, i love him.
you're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
you're leaving?
you go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... only then do they start coming out.  they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... if it's sincere.  if it's pure... they will be with you and take you away forever.
no shit. it's the goddamn water. kill an ox. i buy bottled for my danny. you can't trust the taps.
thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you fucker. 
how do you know what i experience?
fried chicken.  anybody want some?
some hooker phoned it in. there was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. understood?
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
maybe, who knows?  you know how voices are.  let's go.
so many of them... despite what we did for them.  or maybe because of what we did to them.  it doesn't matter.  it's a perfect system now, isn't it?
i haven't seen you before.
nothing for kuzawa?
what?
fine.  i'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
who's they?
john franson and rob stanslyk.
and find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the humvee, and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
been to any good diners lately?
can't stand light?
i know you want to.
you and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
come on mom. give him a break. he's missing the reunion because of you. you know he wants to go.
-- a slice of pizza --
answer my question! weren't you paid to get out of town?
it's okay if you're not.
but she's moving away from the door.  who was sitting at this table?
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow. just the two of us. or just the one of us.
tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  i am ergo the magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
kid, listen: <u>that's all i'm saying</u>. and you didn't hear it from me.
forgive me for intruding so late at night, herr baron.  but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  how say you?
the accent, i suppose.
a man traded with me -- all those for only four.
okay.
cue the fucking violins. come on... it's getting cold.
permission granted.
crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
that's right, hand.
i meant me.
i'm thinking about taking a trip.
it's gorgeous.  just my taste. i've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked.  thanks. so let's get going. long drive.
i know everything about your sister. i'll prove it to you.
i'm sure it won't be long now.
so what.
oh, my. we're too late.
we can learn something from our asian friends. they smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
oh, you're pretty...
what was your grandfather's name?
what're you doing?
the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats? what the hell does that mean?
they're jealous.
again?  how long before we start noticing the difference?
danny, please, we don't want to know.
i just want her to be happy.
but you can't say....
no, i couldn't. i feel too close to her.
what you got, peters?
really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all.  i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
i am. i really am. and i've been travelling. i just can't seem to get that far north.
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
i wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
you're not what? qualified for anything else?
i don't think that's funny.
w-w-where we g-g-going?
not too bad.
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging?
i keep thinking about charles and scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
yes!
the creator of what?
three people. in brainerd.
a goodly length in times past, but lately
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. he was a great swordmaker, my father. and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. he slaved a year before he was done.
me? sure. why?
don't think i'm weak, just because i'm a woman. i have power. give in, stop fighting me, ethan. i always get what i want.
well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
yeah, so where is he?
wally.  this is danny witwer.  he's from justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
don't quibble. you know what i mean.
wolf one -- say intentions.
we're on the move. let's go. as they walk toward a corridor.
it's no big deal, right?
what are you talking about?
their child died, and they got a lawyer.
oh, it did. it had a great deal to do with you.
what?
congratulations. the la guardia flight’s canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine. am i good or what?
you forgot to wash my purple shirt.  i told you a hundred times it was purple day at school today.
i'll be there.
it just is.
i know.  you're quite a celebrity these days.  are you here because you have info ... about my case?
how 'bout another cup of coffee?
wait --
oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
oh, but this one is so simple.
which is why i'm trusting you with this account.
uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts i dug up. now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
a bit.
i've told you, it wasn't a man. it was an animal. a big wolf or something. a rabid dog.
it wasn't reading, it was a performance. brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
dog food.
good. i'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. i hate that motherfucking house and --
i've been doing a lot of thinking.
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
he's commanding the detachment at nu mung ba.
hello, baby.
you're telling me you believe the guy?
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a saturday night. that's also fun.  i came to see selma, as a matter of fact.
manifested?
you can have it for good. it is my wedding present.
harry, you don't have to believe! i'm not even sure i believe. but if there's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
you got it.  it's six dollars a man.  be on the campus in urbana at eight o'clock -
yeah, how can we help? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
got a phone in that van?
that's right.
scobie -- he's the one that objected.
correct.  the fields of france.  and many dead flowers ... oh.  forgive me. my name was spenser.  elliott spenser. captain.
why?
suein hwang and milo geyelin.
oh nothing.
sorry, i just didn't remember.
if we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
who am i supposed to shoot?
where is he?
like, you inspector brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. i think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
my vision got worse again.
that makes a good story.  but i think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
i'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
it's... okay
bigger than that.  for want of a nail a <u>kingdom</u> was lost...
how do you do?
it's terrible.  people won't even return my calls.  it's like i don't exist.
i brought you that, too.
except fall down like a normal person.
we have that taken care of.  you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. no one, you hear?
is it something you've heard about me?
i'll see you, then.
you're a fast mover.
my hands?
venice...like katherine hepburn in summertime. . ....why can't i be katherine hepburn...
think about mom.
up there.
this whole time, you've kept your head. you didn't go money simple like me and wes.  you've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  and you've been fair too.  i mean, even after i...you know...
yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. it wouldn't be the first time. now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. any of them - but get it.
what choice?
thiavolos, as we used to say in greece. the devil.  pure thirst.  nothing more. he was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  like you.  unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
i told you.  you need to rest.
if we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
only were he a fool to boot.  see yon viper?
granted.  where are you going?
don't ever talk like that, fran! don't make yourself out to be cheap.
you killed a prostitute.
the deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, sally... i thought i'd find you here....
i know, but i had to because . . .
what do you do?
have done, and you lot get your pens out.
i don't give a shit about your patient!
they shut all right now. and the blankets are ready.
what kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
let me get one thing clear. did galbraith make a direct accusation?
alright.  you want me to get your old job back?  because i could, you know, i could put in that word.
how the hell do you know?
well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
do you share my madness?
i'm not a doorman, miss barrett.  i'm a building superintendent.
so you'll come to the wedding, right?
yes, miss johnson...
yeah.
i will join my grandfather there.
the fans of narcissus.  they were on vigil outside the school of proximo. they believe he's dying.
oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
do you think he was telling the truth?
like it were a piano?
sure. one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago.
sure.
none that i can detect, sir.
do i not please you, jack?
move in with me.
no, i do not think so.  i don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
ooo, she's thinking of her date!  come on, you've been dating a pilot.  we want to know what we can expect.
you get out of here! if any of you men think you can come busting in here-
he don't sound like he's from 'round here.
thomas?
and next time, miss annie, you can run down the calves...
i remember, too, actually. i was frightened then. i am frightened now.
you know, you saved my life.  and i just wanted to say... i forgive you for talking during the movie. almost.
no, you're --
nigger, fuck me hard!!...
it's a wonder you aren't. i'm amazed, eric. i barely lasted 30 hours. you lasted eight weeks.
slavers capture them and bring them here.
they're not gone, they're here.
because, i'm your attorney.  i shouldn't be going to your house.
yes.
right.
no key, huh?
i've got an idea.  we'll have to work fast.
yeah, right -- when i see it.
i tried to talk to her...  it was like i knew her.  weird.
yeah.
were you close to your father?
same difference.
we got problems topside.
so what's up?
she's not gonna know, sir.
right. six hundred years before the crusades.
that's would be me.
no... please...
...what...?
he didn't veto it.  i ran the white house side.  the mob contact was johnny roselli.  one of the cia guys was that jackass, howard hunt.
why don't you reset and run it again.  the pods check out ok.
why would he contact me?  i just took some lousy pictures.
well... yeah.
i am not.
would you like me to go for her?
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
that's a thick change of heart.
i told you i was gonna hit you.
so you can give me more shit?
the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. i won't be long.
come on... let's find you something to wear.
it sleeps twelve.  this is my friend daphne. she's a vassar girl.
marty...
...i suppose.
i don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
you've done everything that's humanly possible, frederick.  oh, darling, i'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
what about it, tanner.  isn't that the truth?
big joke.  who's the rap this time?
plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
god's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
rollo's the reason i became a cop. i wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  it was supposed to be about truth and justice and rollo.  but somewhere along the way i forgot all that... how about you, jack? why'd you become a cop?
hello meredith.
i just called it.
i just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching tv.
rico! rico! rico! is that enough?  and keep your meat hooks off my radio.
i don't know... my computer...
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter, very professional job.
really?
you wouldn't happen to know what the queen's reading for recreation, would you, mary?
it isn't fair!
hold it.  mary patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
yeah.  but all things being equal, i'd rather be in philadelphia.  by the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
i'm fine! i'm fine!
i'll get it.
...using steroids.  i was a juicer. diabonol, then, wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for christsake.  now i'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
oh yeah. mr. by-the-book, stick-up-the-ass, my- way-or-the-highway death. believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> so i need a job. he sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. i'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
...a cosmetics company by any chance? what are you, the 12th man on the deal team? the last to know?
yes, she takes care of the garden.
wait, wait.  you told her about me?
i can't help you.  no one can.  the precogs are never wrong.
everything's on the fucking run! everything --
coulda been a contender.
sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
and the book says: "we may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
it's not so bad.  so, it just keeps growing?
i want you to hurt me.
what am i, a five year old?
i couldn't tell you.
how do we do that?
remember, kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
can't it wait, then?
if you hadn't used profanity --
who told me wh...?  you've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  you've got a board-up on the window...moss told me.
three grand on the black, jimmy.
i followed you to the maroon studios. when i heard those shots, i thought i'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
yeah, let's get outta here. what happened?
way out here?
yes.
it's not like you're going to lose anything. you can ask anyone in town. i've been nothing if not generous. i want the best for everyone.
a poet. he's sitting right over there. that's his table —— the one at the feet of dante.
because you've got nothing else to live for.
yes, i'm...i'm looking for mr. jason bourne.
well, it's billy.
i know, miss.  but i like to do it. i like to tend for miss jessica and i want to tend for you.  you settle right back, now, and i'll mix you your coffee.

i don't know the process, dr. weir was the expert...
where'd you get the blood?
ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
why?
no way! the whole enchilada in one shot.
why?
i always tell the truth.  of course i can see you.
throw pillows, letty. the sales lady said they're the latest thing.
ooohhhhhh no.
yes. where you from, harry?
cut it out, ma, or i'll--
or perchance...
to make a statement. i'm gonna give them the name.  maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
i don't want to hear about it, okay? that's three jobs for the night. it's over. three jobs and time for a drink. six am, the cocktail hour. pass the bottle; i know you're holding.

_ your father raped someone?
yeah, a little.

it's a thought i had.
yeah, don't come by here any more. if i need you again i know which rock to turn over.
that's easy to say. but how? and what about ricky?
you're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  and, the only reason i'm here right now is because i wanted to be.
<u>this is not a joke</u>!  that sheet was full of ghosts.

would you prefer to do nothing?
bullshit.  put the phone down, mason.
yeah! them.
the l.a.p.d.
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, doctor. as a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
uhh... nothing.
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.
you have opened the playhouses?
it's a secret.
i don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  read it, clark.
why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
i am seventy-four years old.
he also said crow was a fake.
he moved down there after meryl packed up and left.
oh, no.
uh, no.  yes.  i mean, just some scrapes...
i wasn't. i wasn't. she was the pretty one. she died, why not me?  i never said my morning prayers. and i was ugly, i was scrawny, i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, sister mary clitus, called me polkadot livingston.
no.  it's the truth, really.  i swear it.  danny told me.  he went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  she tried to strangle him.
you want to say some words?
klaus tauber.
better to kill than be disturbed.
very logical, deanna... but your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  to leave all of this behind and be with me.
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
she's not sick at all.  she's pregnant.
okay now.  cases:  smith versus state of michigan.
the last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
i'm alright, i'm dealing.
i don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin irish. you heard of the westies?.
but why the hair?
industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information?
i'm ready.
decontamination -- ?
yes. mr. san pedro sula spoke yesterday to his son, archibald leach san pedro sula, who is named after cary grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
you're really...  you, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
merle...
certainly, herr director.
i don't know who.
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
course he has. that's his wife.
oh, he's moved out?
in international news, india plans to release crocodiles in the ganges, the holy hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
why get rid of her at al1? you've used the coffer of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.
not many.
yeah, yeah.  jesus.
no. i wasn't adopted.
a bit fucking late.
sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  a nebbish like you!
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
lets throw another log on the fire.
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. yet there you are, doing all the listening!  you are alone here, aren't you?  it would drive me crazy.
no, we got pressure from california state. the man practically has clemency. we can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
leeloo minai lekarariba-laminai-tchai ekbat de sebat.
you talk like a man with a tin twat.
that's exactly what you mean. heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. well, i'm sick and tired of it. i've given you party after party - i've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? no! you insult them and act like a bore. i'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. maybe i can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
please, just promise me you’ll do that. you have to promise, kate. because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and i don’t think i could live with that.
you ought to stay over. you always wrote a good hanging story, hildy.
only in passing.  to say hello to.
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
if only it were that simple.
frances, it's me, harry?
so i stay. stay until i hustle up enough to play fats again. maybe by that time i'll develop myself some character.
it just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
four years. i came over from the capitol merger in chicago six months ago.
what are you talking about? killing's totally natural. it's dying that isn't natural...
look.
now, what do you want?
same place we are.
salt's good for you, ted.  helps you from getting impotent.
but between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, charlie?
i'm on my way to get a haircut.
when?
okay, okay...
i know.
right.
there's more.
i *don't* think that's the thing to do! no! i think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
what? there must be 2000 of them out there.
one of the fathers was on the tv saying, "my child was not a bum."  and it's playing like gangbusters.  hell, hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.

you couldn't have known.
i wish i knew. uhura?
i know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
blew up? what do you mean it blew up?
if it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
what?
god.
coffee.
sit... and spin.
well, then, what's he doing here?
you sure you want me too?
then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
well, you hear all these things lately. you know--kids spending so much time up there ...  is it holding hands? that kind of thing?
forgive me, don bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
yikes.
yes?
are you nuts or something?  what the hell is that going to do?
i don't believe you.
you do.
yeah, me too.
i know.
virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
yes. those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
now rex.
well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
what? no. i'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
let's see if she can get my model back.
i'm sorry i couldn't come up with something more positive.
don't jerk me off. we all know what this is. you don't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i'm working for. now let's cut the shit. who's the man?
you think you could do better "laredo?"
that shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? i thought you dropped him.
i don't know. we were planning on seeing the astrodome.
morning.
nothing happened.
in theory.
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well --
don't do that, man, okay?
then let's have it.
he never answers.
margaret.
he loves you very much.  he just--
of course... well yeah, a bit. "sin city" by the flying burrito brothers is an all-time top five, but i wouldn't play it at the club.  it's a country-rock ballad.  everybody'd go home.
they removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
i have to get back, they'll miss me. please, jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
please, paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
he'll be here.
he was a stretcher-bearer in the korean war.  were you in a war with father?
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
i want to just talk. i want to talk to that irish bitch.
ma...
come on, let's check the bite radius.
an hour? what's an hour! you know how time flies, walter. my tie? get it.
well, we met about three months ago. he works at the surgeon general office. he loves boating.  so, he's been getting me into water skiing.
we were trying to scare your mother.
walter, i sympathize, but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy --
thanks. come on chris, give me a hand.
we're not delivering shit. ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
yes, so did the germans.
detective carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
quite.
that's all right, that's all right...
me and her got a connection.  read this part. read the part about stuffing her stocking.
spontaneous my ass!! you told the press and you don't tell me. remember you're working for us.
you can't sing at the competition.
what if we could find bi-frost the rainbow bridge?
jail, you asshole!  our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  bunny, ball-ball!
you're a swine, isn't he george?
i'm going to...
i don't want neutral...i want dead --
yeah.  that was thirty years ago anyway.  l.a.'s changed a lot since then. the air got dirty and the sex got clean.  so you want to nail the ex- presidents?  be a big hero?
at the old house with the voice.
...you-you spoke to him?
what?
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now.  i can do it if i get out.
resting up?  sorry spooky, i've got to go with god on this one. i hate to think we're just in this for the money.  garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. we're going out of oasisburg on a win.
i beg your pardon?
thought so.
and a little ice.
ah.
so it's helping?
no.  you're quite wrong.  right here's the seat of the trouble. mrs. holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  it's revived all their old superstitions -- zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
well - it's cold, margie.
after we've worked the note we want to replace it in lecktor's cell. i don't want him to know we found it.  where's lector now?
he will not permit anyone but me to see him. you must be outside this room.... do what you can.
damien karras.
you think he's for real?
... they do, indeed.
i thought it over, and you were right. you wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
maybe that's who your father is, cartman!
get over here.
he's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
i'm a agent as well. kgb. i've been undercover for over a year.
that's compared to, like, earthquakes in the far east or testicular cancer?
not for you.
let 'em come. i'm ready.
well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
how can i taste it now? we've already had like twelve courses.
are you writing a poem?
what's going on? what happened to stacks? is everything okay?
yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
are you busy after work ?
nah, it's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing.  it didn't hurt at all.  it was just a yoga move.  i tucked my head in.
what crook?
i want to sleep. give me five minutes on that couch.
did they try and fail?
why should i loan you my car?
because if they don't, i'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
and your folks didn't understand?
no, we ain't got no kirin.  we got miller.
deals?
who?
meade has 18 underground acres of computers. they scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "president". we red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. when the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
lit 101 got canceled, so i stopped home and brought you some lunch.
neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
maybe we can catch it.
you know, i get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
wrong week. next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon.
actually, i'm here to see if there's anything i can do for you.
yeah, but i hardly noticed it. i'm more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
where is he?
i'm cooking' up. there is a silence.
it is you, isn't it, harold?
400 years ago?  i'm sure christopher columbus would've loved these accomodations.
i'm a little short.  i've been out of work.  let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
natural to the line of work they was in.
louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
as ready as we <u>can</u> be!  i'll report to the skipper.
who...are you?
opera? opera!
what's her first name?
it's what kevin called her when he was little...
you don't aim to kill nobody, tom!
we wait until 7:00. if he is not here with the twins he is not coming. we leave. that was your promise. go help the children.
i know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
kat ellis! we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you. you haven’t visited me once in d.c. where the hell have you been? i have gynecologists that call more often.
but i love you, laura.
my guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
don't explain, sidney... it doesn't matter now...
no food?
i'm sorry.
your back? did you fall?
okay. let's get serious. of course i know the cult of good is not good. ever since i saw what they did in atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. i've followed them to oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. that computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. this isn't just a story, selina--another damn pulitzer--this is my life.
epps, my leg is falling asleep.
okay, okay.
we're here for you, diane.
too bad.
what's this about, money?
i never laid a hand on her in anger. not a day. not even when i's drinkin'. but this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile.
you gotta kill yourself.
assa good idea, pappy.
that's fine.
doesn't matter. i always finish second.
no!....
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared...
hello chris, this is knox overstress.
you've done a lot of growin'...
it happens to be how i feel.
you were married?  all those falls, i'm surprised you had time.
it's only our first date.
they'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. they've got you down as a sap.
me get heap firewater --
what shows?
what did she say?
i like darrell.  he may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. we own harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
a little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  it's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
well, maybe i will have a sandwich.  do you mind waiting a few minutes?
this should do it.
amy, it's me.  listen very carefully..
ok, i'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
subtlety?
oh.  my condolences.
there's more than one?
brian...
what happened to cole?
what you got that's good to eat?
why would you be here?
this is where i found doucet twenty years ago.  thought maybe he'd come back.
this is his assertion.
that's what i have to believe...
no...
all deserts have water, somewhere. god shall lead us there.
i didn't hear anything. got any dessert?
in that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
why didn't the state's investigation uncover mr. roston earlier?
doesn't matter. i... i don't want to come back, that's all.
i will prove it to you.  come swim with me now, vincent.  now--tonight.
yes -- 'hildy, darling'. i'm just a fool. that's what i am. i know what it's going to be like.
yeah, yeah. that's the fucking problem.
to tell you that we're interested in the property.
i donít know.  it didnít say on the tickets.
there's nobody coming?
nothing. just hanging out with silent bob and his cousin.
you got <u>that</u> right!
that's not good in prison. it's just not good.
long as we don't lose heart, jack...
leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it didn't exist... and, leon... i can't say it...
over there man.
i just need to use the phone, lady.
if we have to see the porter we'd better go.
what about... those guys... i might have...
cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
yes, i slept with him but that was a long time ago.
i'm looking for trade
okay. but i'm back in half an hour.
oh, yeah, right.  the deal.
no, honey... it was part of the deal.
don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  we've had a lot of trouble.
what do you mean, ross?
so what are you going to do?
that was two days ago. frankly, i think this place is a bit boring. it's all white. why doesn't the guy put up some posters? maybe some bullfight things . . .
yes, you do, you damn well do.
it's tom.
let me explain --  -- no, there is too much. let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
everything you couldn't.
that doesn't help anything, bill.
these are whipped body creams. it's like a lotion.
been divorced for a year now, bud.
i've got you.
wonderful? he kissed her and played with her titty, and i don't see anything so great about that. he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him.
i don't know.
i'm not going to wait. i'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things i used to do.
then we've been away from earth for eighteen months.
i think you like learning.
i do, baby, i do.
now listen to me very carefully.
il signor ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate.
him.
what happened?
you would! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
i'm told you've asked for a bureau cross-check of flight records to and from el paso, ft. myers, omaha, the murman murder time frames.
would you say this "leon" was actually lee harvey oswald?
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  i've uncovered the details on project vulcan. it's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
what's the matter?
you're outta here!
head still secure to the neck.
i want to go to his place.
of course she knew! for one thing, addison told her how superbly eve had read the part-!  karen, let me tell you about eve. she's got everything - a born actress. sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
still unconscious?
this is l. b. jefferies, a friend of tom's. who am i talking with?
you mean they ate each other up?
--no, what's wrong with you?
how about if i call you?
yes.  well, i'm coming over to your house to get some things.
no.
what is a sip of coffee going to do?
jack wells.  a museum sent you?
can anything be done for him?
that village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
why?
i would be interested to know what we are talking about.
no!
wait a minute ...
how about that jeep?
senora, anything it costs, i can work--
for the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, i'm never alright.  when i secure the line, come on up.
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. we have compassion for all people.
son of a bitch. they knew each other.
your self-restraint puzzles me, admiral. you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
i just needed some extra money.  i was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
yes.
all right, thelma...that's it. i've had it.  you can call your good friend joanna kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  i mean, i don't know what i did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
huh?
yeah, well we're still a little young for albany state prison. are you pissed about al? i'm pissed too, but i'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
who says?
i don't actually think jeffrey's gonna notice.
what in the world would give me that idea?
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "jesus christs"!
what?
it's my mother.  who needs this shit?
it could have been anything.
you're all hear.
i'll hate you forever.
well, i don't have no trousers on...
not, "what", babe!  when!
muchas gracias.
if there is one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
it's creasy.
thank you....
one drop?
and joe's huge in europe.  he's like a rock star in london.  his novels sell millions.
maybe plans changed...
his death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
about an hour ago. i had to hand over all our cash.
depends on what you call love.  when i was growing up i had nothing.  i learned to want everything.  i wanted more than sierra anyway. jake was my ticket.  he's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  i courted him.  i let him think he was courtin' me, but i reeled him in like a fish on a line.  i wanted him.  i wanted what he could give me, and i would've done anything to get him.  is that love?
gazzo's a good man.
send a unit.
...the albanian campaign.  this... this is history...
how should i know?
awwwww!
i . . . can't . . . argue . . .
not bad.  i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me.
it's my father's birthday--that's all.  that's all.  who cares about that?
man, you're crazy. what kind of a place is this?
belong - to you? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
if you're looking for enchantment, jack, that i can give thee...
oh my god --
i think you know. the timetable has been set. it will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. the president will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency. fema, agent mulder. the secret government.
yah.
it is
what are you talking about ? we both know you're gonna be a pilot.
the kiss tickets, you nimrod! they're just fuckin' gone! please tell me you have'm!
yeah, that was considerate of me. i recommend you read it.
michael meyers.
have you ever figured they might extradite you?
then it was over the water department.
relax, wally.  he had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
you think <u>i</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  you think <u>i</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
no, you can't have any more chairs! there's only one left in here now, and i need that to sit on!  oh ... er, sorry. who are you?
eric...you can't be like me. you have to be better. i'm not the guy you think i am...
whether crabs are in season there now...
that's why the little people sent you. just <u>like</u> magic.
he never did want to. i figure he ain't changed his mind much.
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me. toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
oh, i know.
brimmer you're fucked up...
where the hell are you?
think that's, uh-
but fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
yes, comrade?
what about back home?
these three died in the crash. their bodies are as frail as our own. you just have to get past their technology, which is, i'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
he taught all this to swann?
something awful happened last night.
yeah, i guess. mark?
no, i don't have to believe you.  the jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
there was blood everywhere, rosa. i saw it, i think i watched the whole thing happen... oh my god...
so is mine, within the framework of my rules.
we'll go back tonight.  bring the children.
why not?
the epa?  what's he want?
i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father's name is nathan lee morgan, and...
thank you. you're very kind.
hate that.
nurse!
yes, that would be great. are you her for the convention?
yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
yes?
let the record state the witness has identified, diego delgado.
there it is. the beryllium sphere.
that's right.  you're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
i don't blame you.
coulda been much worse.
does clifford even know?  you didn't tell him, did you?  i'm gonna tell him. where is he?
-- roger --
i don't want to see the dress.
why not?
well, brain-dead anyway.  coma patient. it's really not all that important.
mornin, chessy...how's the back...?
not now, harold...  you can't put me down for monday?
i've had time to get over it.
how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. big fuckin' deal. i'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. how good am i doing?
no.
you've got three broken ribs, man!
and only you can become a queen?
you need help with your kids?  i could probably do that.
okay, i give up.
yes, i...
did he see any sign of them?
i lie to my parents every day. and every night.
not down south you don't.
she married a hockey player.
charlie -
i don't care if they wear galoshes!
this isn't '48, dick.  they'll never buy it.
m-m-m-mack?
hello, luv.
hardly dude, a new 'vette?  the kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  wait in the car, donny.
city hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - i see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  you ruined people's lives.
so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
you don't love me.
no speech.
i wish there was something i could do....
rust?
"mr. lovejoy"? that's the title?
forgive me. it is not here. i assumed he had mind-melded with you. it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near.
if it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
weird, huh?... know what i think is weird? decent men with loving families go home every day after work. they turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
that's not the reason. i've got a date at six thirty.
no, no news. we don't want to know what's happening in the world. we want to be left alone, don't we?
she was born after they put me away. how can i have feelings?
what the hell're you talking about?
--i'm not staying here!
and so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the phantom zone. in it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
it is a star!  that's great.  you're very good.
point of view is everything. to us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
i like well your conceit, jack.  tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
either it goes to mitchell or it comes here.
oh, i'm here, all right.  i'm very here. question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
holy shit!
i haven't got that far yet.  but i don't think that everything points to wynant.  what about the alibis?
and if it is?
dr. darling, peter ... all you ...
how was your plane ride?
i see...
my friend li mu bai.  he's given it to sir te as a gift.
well i was thinkin' like, when bela played "fu manchu."
but i... i need those books.
the g-man?
you don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
after all these years of blissful silence, i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
great.  you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  did you?
i'm here, mr. moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the party.
53!
i told you i don't like to talk about it.
did you know him?
i'm trying to bust the tijuana cartel.
her family name?
yeah, i remember.... kill any jews yet?
you enjoy it?
a flower...
they won't fight with me....
nick's a nick, n' it?  no matter what state you're in.  state of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
do i know you?
goodbye.
okay. then, tomorrow, i take the kids with me to the picket line.
ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
evan. he's a mucky-muck union official from massachusetts. you're lucky.
absolutely duncan i'm on top of everything.
aye.
not really, no.
of course.
sex.
you stumbled around. remember, you've got my id, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
you mean i won't resist them.
dead?
m.f.e.o.?
what are you getting at?
yes, darling.
maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
i'm on my way back in. over.
i hate chickens.
so don't goddam come!  please.
now i know. it's when i can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  that's my idea of being normal.
try the wine!
i told the guy i didn't want to talk to...
nothing.
so he killed himself.
watching my son...ted, i've been living in new york for the past two months.
when will they be here?
same one you had yesterday?
let's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly? or careers... clue... snakes and ladders?
yes. screw george washington. just like marilyn monroe did.
then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  i'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  this expedition is over.
i told you, it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes.
i'll be there for you.
so why are you talking to him?
your instructors tell me you're doing well. top quarter of the class.
are you two gals all funny with each other?
athos, i beg you --
no, it should be over soon.
lily-- 
i promise. is that all?
you've nothing to apologize for.
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
where you get your bank statements.
matt, come here!
who cares?  mmmm. now i remember. mayo the wop. gee, i'm glad you're here. i've been looking forward to this all week.
i do okay.
a wig?
i'll have a highball.
the heater's here.
yeah, maybe so. frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to don, isn't it. remember that. your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
this is purely professional curiosity, karen, i swear.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
nothing, i guess. i guess i can wait till we get home. maybe we'll stop by wickham's for a hamburger when we get to lawford. that suit you? you always like wickham's.
cynthia. john. meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
we're only goin' to koreatown. you'll be in there -- ten minutes.
i'll bet the butler's name wasn't "jeff."
wake up, we're in trouble.
that's how time works, laurie.  everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  we're all puppets.  i'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- thirty seconds.
it's all right.  it's not hurting...
you seem to know all about my destiny.
you don't have to if you don't want to --
i don't know.  cancer, i--
tell me something, dorie.  a man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
it's more than that.
they appear to be authentic.
miss daniels is staying for the weekend. in fact, i've already invited her to dinner tonight.
well spoke.  true to the mark.  and if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
landon. i can't even do for myself.
they ain't laughing, man. something's wrong.
so kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, maria... and blew the whistle on you. suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. but, up to this point, you've been their golden boy, their rising star... their behavior is... inconsistent.
thank you.
she's haze grey and underway...
here it is.  very first copy.
jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. she-she was too busy getting raped by cossacks.
milo. why would he --
but! i'm a married woman!
yes.
their atmosphere will sustain him. he will look like one of them.
was i ever of use?
sorry.
i didn't want to stop.
well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
better than that.
come on!
i don't know -- but i'm not afraid to try.
i can't talk you into it?
i think they'll be all right, honey.
yes?
you're at paul owen s.
you stuff sausage in it.
they can survive winter.  as long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am i foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
good-morrow, cousin.
yeah, like people in love.
sounds like i'll have to. don't fall asleep, okay? wear something fabulous. dorsia, remember?
that's an after-market alarm. can't just cut her wires ...
tell him to put the kettle down and i'll give him money.
that's it.
of course, of course. well, any time, just drop by.
do they worry you that much, then?
i'm fine..
i didn't choose him as my deputy, mr. president.  you did.
oink! oink!
defuse the bomb.
look, michael... you don't have to come.
george. george - do you mind? i'm sorry, but i can't talk about it tonight.
weird? if this happened last month it would've been weird. now with... the tv and... now it's just too weird.
aw, forget it.
right you are, governor!
come on, man, i'm telling you what you already know.
it's my shot.
at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
why?  juba was an african and you want to look the part -- hold still.
you did, didn't you?
... to target at ban kia na.  we probe the site...
which parts?
i don't think i want to hear this --
czar peter gave it to his wife, catherine the great. for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
no.
i have detailed files.
i don't know.
there must be over a million dollars in here.
that'd be fine, bobby.
give him the works.  hello, duffy, get set! we've got the biggest story in the world. earl williams caught by the morning post -- exclusive!
are you... are you recording? or do- are you with any label now?
you have the best answer for everything.  you seem so... hopeful. are you always this sunny?
....it's alright....
cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
no, maggie, i defended you. humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  it's the theme of this party.
no.  not even you.
but if we have not caught wallace --
yes, sir.  it seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of berlin, germany.  now i ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my god-given talent.
what?!?!
probably.
all right...but i'm givin' the orders...you take 'em or we split up here and now...
there's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
uh uh. i'm disco barbie.
no!
i'll make you a deal.  get out of here. right now.  i'll do the job with the snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
i'm alexander p. lovett, sir.
why're you crying?
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's dna! you have any idea what that means?
and that's why you both lead the gang. two of you went into that bank together, right?
he has all of superman's powers. if i've planned it right. . .
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
oh hi jennie. do you want to come make out with me?
he's gonna be around a lot and i hope you are too, so...
i'm not cured. i was never sick! they had no business putting me in there! my only responsibility is to myself now!
we're on our way. red group, gold group, all fighters follow me.  told you they'd do it!
i'm not denying it's a joyous day --
what is this, some kind of joke?
well, you'll just have to make do with him .
i think i'll see hat action.
there is no letter.
thank you, desmond.  what's the reason for your truancy?
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr. loomis.  her home office was ransacked.  it was chock full of loomis' files on meyers.  it'd say that makes meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
of course not. we're going to baltimore. it's much nicer in baltimore.
why doesn't it scare you?
ah. yes, the little door.  there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. if you hurry, you'll just make it.
don't you want it?
sorry.
your dad must be really pissed.
it isn't the fourth dimension. to you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
i forgive you.
get over what? i don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody i know.
yes.
i don't know - i'm not sure it's a good idea.
...whaddo i do?
aw, you can sleep, hon.
i've got a lot of thinking to do.  'sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
i feel like a jerk.
huh?
you still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
it's nothing.
[cutting in] mackenzie, listen to me. listen. i'm going to die.
i mean, when will i be normal.
i'll be there.
who we gonna beat?
in a pasha's harem, majesty. a seraglio.
we got to start rehabilitating, duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
jesus.
and you don't speak french?
well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
then - would you talk to mr. fabian about it?
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  fellow..."
i know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
good work, flynne.  you're a first-rate rat.
hey , hey !
you and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. put it in gear.
data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
no.
well why didn't you say so?  you want me to lift some weights or something?
can you think of a better reason?
which one did you take, will?
yes, well, i suppose you'd know a little something about that.  not to worry.  i'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  and what better way to entice them ... than with a little ivan's ooze?!
it's bad. before you even showed up, he said you were maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. he wanted to tcb alone. i was gonna ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board. now he's spooked. this shit's snowballing.
what time are you gonna pick me up?
that's gonna be tough because dixie mccoy's dead. the a.i. flatlined him.
you've got power, veronica. power i didn't think you had. the slate is clean.
yeah, there's a pair'a broads i'm thinking might be good for this.
i'll give you half of it.  here's seventy cents. 
dad, did you do it?  did you take that money?
bed.
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. it wouldn't really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door...what are you selling?
if there was one.
stick to my heels.
would you follow <u>her</u> through an airport?
no, that's fine.  it's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star.  it was a thrill for me.  how is he?
sometimes every day, for a while.
he's talking to you, bro.  what he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
i heard about thorkel's order--
never heard of him...
no.  he stopped by himself.  okay? that's all.  let me go.
yes, thanks.
gear shift.
won't happen.  i'm strong in my mind.
and bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
it will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  he will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe.
not a man.  ezekiel walters.
what?
is she a friend of yours?
...that'd be my guess.
yes... i'll give you that.
oh, i must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
oh, n-no, sir. the sea-gull is a lovely bird.
come on, let's go...
yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
in a way -- this girl, thea. you must stay away from her.
i'm thinking someone got away with murder.
we'd better adjust our streams.
 you must understand, this is all new to me...
if he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  the important thing, doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
i'm not agreeing.  don't think i'm agreeing, because i'm not.
i'd rather you just talked.  anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and mr. kane.
mister washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving mister bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
what?
we're here to find zephram cochrane. he may be injured or dead.
i think he nearly ruptured his truss.
look kid, i know what it's like, i was a kid, too.  even stole a horse once.  but you can't--
no, i'm not mad at you, hand. it'll be all right. just spot and follow through...
try again, c'mon, try again.
i wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  she was always on the up and up with me.  but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
is this slow enough for you?
i want children.
it's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
no...his business is bad.  but i'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
where's that?
when he uses a phrase like "i am happy", i think we should think twice about what we ask him.
i -- forgive me, ma'am, i am no wiser than yourself.
well... you don't look so prosperous. hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. we could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
sir...
angels don't get any older, son.
here we are. pink and blue receipts. all you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
yah, got a front movin' in.
yes it does.  don't you see?  we have to play by the rules.  that's what it wants.
maybe we should just listen to the radio.
your men are right to be afraid.
joey bevo said it was important. said i had to give it to him myself.
this is gotta be a game, right?
naturally.
yeah. it's time to beat the drum. you better wait here. he don't trust the white man.
other clinics?  oh sure.  clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
no.
why didn't you beep my communicator?
they can't reduce nuclear fuel. but once the reactor's miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
you have to help me.  you will understand.  and no, you're not dreaming.  do you know where we are?
that's right, sir.
yes, sir... but, do you have these?
questions make me nervous. part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
yeah.  what?
it's not that kind of date.
try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and i won't have to hassle you...
man, i don't want to go into this.
oh, god no, i made him sleep on the couch.
can you be there by two-thirty?
if you don't have...i mean...
one of my sources.  her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa.
you could always go with me.  i'm sure william has some friends.
you're fucked up, lila.  why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? figure it out for chrissake.
oh sure.  this girl is a college graduate.
right!  where?
three kids.  what's she going to do?
oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
like what?
a tragic story, no doubt.  how'd you get up here?
he's an actor, so it can't be good.
yeah.
yeah.  i don't see a way out of it.
oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
no ...
...he's right here, mr. mayor...
fuck him - let him out!
you two have a lot of catching up to do, i guess.
inspired, ms. ivy.
i took yours from you.  your little girlfriend?  i took hers, too.  your meaningless, petty life?  i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  you're no avenger. you're mine.
heard you come here now and again. figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
i'm sorry, sir.  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso. this is the new hotel paraiso.
yeah...
i asked you to keep that thing outside.
you keep calling me dmitri.  you really shouldn't.
there's nothing to be sorry about.
i seen your fucking face.
yeah, that's right. now could you be quiet so i can get some sleep.
the people in the town?
well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
your honor, i'm only examining the man's employment record.  he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
we don't want to tire you out, dear.
try a long walk.
take them and put them in a safe place.
leave me alone!  after eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  i crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  you and i may not meet again for months!
the next batter, clendenon, hits one outta the park.
what time is it there?
fine, dixie. fine.
i thought so too, doll. i guess we were mistaken.
i just want to make sure that you both --
you know... she's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... eeeww, it's so faggy i can't even talk about it.
listen, i should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  i don't need this aggravation.  i'm getting old.
shut up and walk...
oh, no, sir.
i think if he told me he was going to steal van gogh's "sunflowers in a vase" i would remember it.
a thing i made.
wesley didn't even want to come up here. he warned me, but i insisted...  i have to ask you, betty...are you crazy?
okay, give me a bottle of wine.
...going to war...
no.
why? you wanna ask me out?
you mean this is -- goodbye?
that was nice of you.
you're crazy! you can't do that!
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
i'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and warren out to a ballgame.
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. louisa was henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. four or five years go by, and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with louisa. i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. they're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. and the poor girl never came back.
like that merchant-ivory clap-trap. all those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
they will.  they w-w-will.
yes.
is tim there?
commercials.
he's my friend, too.
it's always the same ... if i've said it once.
how's it coming?
i'd be helpless and useless. they don't have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
how's that?
call me johnnie... n.o. has always been a good town to sit around in.
well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
nexus - 6.
it's not that.
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
how much?
i don't know. it's not... seasoned yet. wait. huh. yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. god, it's unholy.
yellow's a bad color for me.  i'll look green at breakfast.
what want ye, girl child?
i love two things. i love you, and i love the opera. if i can have the two things that i love together for one night, i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
i put his -- who --  look, marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
were you in cluett's apartment?
hi.  she's auditioning for a television commercial.  she said she's gonna be a little late.
red, i found something --
oh god... oh god... santos... oh god marietta... are you in on this?... oh god!!!
i've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  i forgot to phone mel kaufman.
i'm working on it.
...not enough food?
something wrong with the stairs?
we can get to work on that oil!
i don't follow your logic. what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell's money?
your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
but the line has to be drawn.
nothing.
a job. construction. twelve an hour.
reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
i don't know. you can never be sure with vaughan. this is his show.
ww... uh...
but keaton...
racket? what do you mean?
what do you love so much?
no, i don't believe i know anyone by that name.
mama, shut up!
cut it out.
the thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
what does that mean?
oh, jesus...
answer the question, father paranoia.
sorry.  we had another bat sighting.
let's get it over with.
but this is life. this isn't a movie.
river oaks, brook farms.  all of that shit.  somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
huh?
i knew he slept in a toolshed.
thanks for having me, sally.
yes.
1530 hours.  might still be there. base out.
he manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. he's very successful.
why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
get out.
hey, anytime.  actually, no.  this was enough.
you're not going to abuse them. they're all so sweet.
yes, ma'am.  but my name is adam.
...fine.
you do? i'm glad. because i feel for you --
you've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the equator...
i wish i didn't love you so much.
i'm willing to be overcharged. tell me.
it's not for me; it's for my kids.  you're the only one i trust them with.
he hears...everything.
ginger.
the escape bubbles?
yes.
is this a--what day is this?
no it's okay, i understand, really.
you ordered me to kill my brother.
call it a passion.  i've got to get going.
now tell him goodbye.
buying her?
next morning. both boats. nothing wrong.  my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer - silicon dragon.'
so do i!
i see.  let's make this quick, then. i'm busy.
'cause you're kind. it's in your nature.
well not much.
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for wichita's lightning rod?
that's it.
the first time i've been grateful for coit tower.
what is the truth?
she threw up in her mask.  let's cut the bullshit.  say it:  she threw up in her mask.
"whereas once i was blind, now i can see."  night, nick.  best of luck.
yeah, i didn't know what else to do.
vanished. thin air.
go away.
no.
yeah.  i got it.
who?
hi.
i did. first and only blow. so far.
i figured it out.
you can say that again.
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie, too?
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
no.  i told you.  i like apple butter not butter butter.
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
don't do it.
you don't wanta make any promises, mr. kane, you don't wanta keep.
oh louis, i just don't know about this--
he never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
that reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, i've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
yeah, me too, mind if i tag along?
you know, that daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call -  'hello, adolf? wilhelm speaking. listen, old pal, there's a jew-boy musician i want you to help. he needs a permit to get to paris.'
oh...
no. i can't. not yet.
moving in?
i'm not! i'm just trying to get some facts.
no shit?
these people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
you do?
yes...i...yes.

i don't see anything.
long pause) you know it.
...two indians to fan me all night. the heat.
hardly.
look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
okay then.  i'll do it.
american literature. what else?
you've asked me that one three times.
i'm trying.
ayegor!  find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
turn left at the lights.
i thought it was an accident.  smoking in bed.
if it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
that's a-no good.  you gotta insult somebody from another country.  look --  i come from one country.  you come from another country.  i say something you don't like.  you say something i don't like - and i'm insulted.
why?
sorry, the name's adam canfield.
does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  you don't have to answer now.  he wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  you take your vacation, adam.  say 'bye!
how 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
have ya been to the celebrity room before? with other, uh, clients?
now is the time to secure your epitaph. the benevolent marquise, charenton's most revered philanthropist... or satan's bride.
not quite.
why not?  if you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  the record's
yes i was... he said his last words to me.
and bobbie says...
i hate it when you talk like this.  go on.
mischief?  what the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
i want to know.
did it really go well?
i'm still scared as a motherfucker, ordell. they talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
clever.
i didn't even know about it.
he knew my husband who died.
peter warne! 
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  i'm now going to even that score.  i'm going to break in his door and i'm going to smash his violin.
i saw a statue once called the third time phyllis saw me she exploded.
dr. kent.
yeah... i seen him around.  high- roller dude named strader.  joshua strader.  runs a club on the west side.  encounters.
did god forbid you to tell the truth?
the manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
"before what?"
stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
it's him.
all right. all right. i just cleaned b-8. give me a break.
because the president says it is.  my job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
when's clifton picking you up?
they'll be able to track it.
yes.  your old friend from cuba.
why?
i was scared.
i know.
i'm not doing anything.  i just thought i'd go home and have some cold pizza -
you're welcome, grace.
i don't know.  did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
it's because i'm human that i can do this.
listen, i'm sorry i --
you played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
what night?
i don't know.  but i'm in trouble. i'm all over the papers. i have to figure out what's going on.
maybe they'll be the next dion and the belmonts.
soon, captain... quite soon.  
what were you doing there? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group.
because i don't want to see him hurt.
what?
sailor ain't a murderer. you got to get off that kick. and far's i can tell, sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' lula. even there he was protectin' her. you oughta be thankin' him for that. that bob ray lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. why am i tellin' you this, you was around that night. you ought to know just exactly what happened. sailor just got a little too forceful is all... you remember that night...
wait!!  where are you?
what?
jazz?  that's funny, coming from you.  okay, some jazz for the jazz man. how's this?  i'll ask a question.
hmmmmm.
obviously there was.
you were afraid of heights?
truly.
i do, please.
you're up on your details, aren't you?
fust thing i'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. better not get no side- meat right off. save that for later. maybe sat'dy. got to get some soap too. an' milk. rosasharn's got to have some milk.
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
i'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... i can tell from your snores.
at your discretion...but first, i desire more entertainment.
listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows washington and lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
fish?
i am not!
do you know it?
we'll be all right.
hey drop it, okay?
yes, amy?
no, i'm from iowa. i just work in outer space.
you know what? he probably gets bored with all that shit.
hey, chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. time is money, miss archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big daddy earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
in what way?
you're spoilt because you're an only child. you need a brother. or i do. i'm weary of you both.
yes. i was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
so he could have decided to go on a trip...
i don't know.  he didn't have a uniform on.  he...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed wes.
they didn't like me.  they never liked me.
strength. westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. heather chandler was that leader but...
mr. lime's.  accident...
we never thanked him for giving us our special needs class.
mm. you know, does he tell you about how, uh, jeff, pony, started the band...?
just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. keep moving and file on out when you're through.
drop dead... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? she's trying to break my trust.  how do you like that?  i can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...

me neither. but i believe in knowing your enemy.
why?  what do you mean?
uh-huh.
martini out!
only your body will remain.  i believe your soul will be at peace.  if we kill you, satan can't stay.
not at all.
i hear you sir, but i'm not leaving.
kelly, get over here.  you didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  kelly, meet my friend paden.
hey, you couldn't know.
you've come to lecture me?
you're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? we've got your kiss song playing and everything.
i was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
there is no problem. did i say there was a problem?
i’m afraid i have bad news, mr de moraes. i have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
the turk wants to talk!  the nerve of that son of a bitch!  after he craps out last night he wants a meet.
got it.
that's me.
you used me as bait?!
nothing, i guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
it'll be ready.
calm down, baby.
that's his sister. vera webster.
no...
yes ma'am.
i know.  but you have a full day of school tomorrow --  you, too.
anthony, i'm petrified.
they're going to fry me for it, anyway.
if you fuck me on this one, i'll spare no expense.
mom’s refining her strategy for dday.
shut your mouth!
really? oh, grazie, signore! sono commosso! e un onore per mo eccezionale. compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
good. so what do you think?
but elaine --
wait!  calm down, mrs. tasker. there is only one more question.
bobbie, please.
unfortunately.  we can't.
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson?
yup. that's one of the great things about paris. lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
quiet!
take them, but i'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
i do.  i do.  in my own way.
can't he? he's done it, son!
mine?
sounds good.
hey, just calm down, i'm giving the orders here-
you're lying. how can you... with your own daughter!
you ever think maybe you have a family?
isn't that rather too close...?
and sweet?
hey, kid.
of course i am.
look, i'd love to keep chatting-
i don't know. wine? fermented grapes?
they'll come around. close your eyes, i wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. the first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
why? they don't hold him for more than a day or two.
i know.
couple of days ago we see the same m.o. out in los feliz.
i didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- i just asked what it was.
just some answers.  there are other kids involved, its not just kristen.  all good kids, smark kids.
don't fuck with me. i don't want to hurt you.
i guess it's not that obvious, then.
riddick? how close?
you called me. you wanted my help. you know, lenny, i've had more rewarding friendships than this one. although i do get to keep using the same jokes.
all right, doc...
hi ya' doin'?  where to?
hey, i'm glad you put truth in your song, man. that's important.
when?
obvious?  why don't you and i have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
yes, i know...
rosomoff, i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents.
yes. and i know you.
yeah, well, i'll tell ya somethin'. i'll tell ya somethin'. i had this boyfriend, chuck.  ya know him, mac. ya remember, chuck.
it's just so strange...
sure.
the manager's door is metal.
i don't think of us that way - ever.
stay out of this...  doctor?
...regression of modern man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
i think you should go now.
the structure seems intact.  they have power.
and mr. kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
i see.
no.
you know, most movies that win a lot of oscars, i can't stand. "sophie's choice", "ordinary people", "kramer vs. kramer", "gandhi". all that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
who the hell do you think you are, sir???
i am thinking particularly of the other ovary. as a rule i don't believe in removing it. the woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. do you follow me?
jean-luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
if i'm not there by quarter of, i'm not coming.
naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
yes, i know. it's the backlog, everybody complains. was it all right otherwise?
are you the killer ben?
probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
many of the thieves will resist. my regular enforcers will be inadequate.
oh, i hate the other kind.
fuck factor ten.
mr. chekov, slow down. take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
these are ich luge bullets. my grandfather snared a shitload of them in w.w. two. they're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
hi.
this time we'll make an exception.
oh, would you stop lying mother!
nothing happened.
she got all right?
you look... different.
jefferson airplane. "white rabbit." i want a rising sound.
there is no letter. i made it up.
he killed her...he killed her...
i will be happy if i have you. i love you.
i am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. you have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person i've ever seen.
hey josh.
and you admire that?
if you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? i've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
he's not really my uncle.
what are the heads?
well, here i am.  you look pretty today.  red suits you.
but sir, most of the people we are putting into the "park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. they are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
shit.
what, doctor?
you put up a great fight, lion.
i wouldn't imagine where.
i can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
what brought this on?
you just seem to know all these things about me and i don't know anything about you, you know. what kind of music do you like?
oh!  you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco!  the juicy stories? like who shot who in the embarcadero august, 1879?
books are good!
yes.
what? on one hearing only?
oh, so the bitch escaped.
paris? you came from paris?
say your prayers?
i mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. i mean i think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the right people.
not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
for the flat.
's all right, grampa. you just kind a tar'd, that's all. somebody fix a pallet.
but - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
...dat's too much money.  i can't 'ford it.  i needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
it's good.  let him go.
what's that....?
oh. maybe r.j. got into a crash and killed everbody?
that don't match either of the victim's.
could i?
do you think they have a room here?
the hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. what i want is a vote on it right now!
these pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
what was the file name?
off....
it's great.  you wanna speak to mary? hold on...
they're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
that night, i went to the houmfort. i kept seeing jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. the drums seemed to be beating in my head.  the chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  and then i heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  my voice.  i was possessed.  i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie.
what the hell are you talking about, greek?
you betcha.
no, no, <u>wait</u>...
well it's not safe for me up there either. the killer found me dewey. he called me last night.
i want it done thursday evening, around eight pm. my wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. it's the staff's night off.  these will be open.
i didn't aim to.
i'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
basically.  the skynet funding bill is passed.  the system goes on-line august 4th, 1997.  human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, august 29. in a panic, they try to pull the plug.
yeah?
what is that sup...
if we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
tried to.  can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. if i had a direct terminal ...
i think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
but maude, you don't understand. i love you. do you hear me? i've never said that to anyone in my life before. you're the first. maude. please don't leave me.
sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
oh. it means that santa's gonna fuck hanukkah's shit up.
it is to us!  it's computerised.
how so?
from now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
it is more than a feud between two families. he stole my mother away from her people.
jesus...
here we go.
just call it.
we don't serve them here and you know it. i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. he owes me money for this damage.
he shut down your paper!  you're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches!
we were neighbors for a couple for weeks on sutton place.
hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? j. t. s. brown.
there you go with that we again.
i'm here.
if it played in england somebody owes me money.  who told you that -- eddie?
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
out there is a perfect engine, an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. look at that! those proportions are correct.  i know sharks.
did she talk?
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
i.a.'s calling themselves the "corruption task force."  can you believe that? trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other detectives may have made over the years.  they're turning it into a witch hunt.  something on the news about it practically every night.
i didn't know it was classified information.  i mean, i know we don't have any customers, but i thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
oh, no. no. our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
that'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
women swoon!
that's what you think.
then they can watch.
alright, let's take a vote...
but rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
right.  that's exactly what i meant.
farm...
i don't know. this is bad.
she was a revelation...
if you don't start telling the truth... 
it's not going to happen.
who am i?? who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... give me the paint.  give it to me.
you were never thirteen, mom.
missed me bad, huh?
i'm not appealing the decision.
sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say jefferson smith.
a universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
hi.
there's a furnace.
no way.
i'm not going.
oh, yah?
correct.  so instead, i stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
it’s my job.
now you.
must be some strange power westley has over you women.  how do you expect to get there?
no, i'm not worried.
david, tomorrow night is the full moon. you'll change, you'll become...
not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
you could have told them!
what's that then?
then it's godspeed, screwball.
how the fuck should i know!!
you think i'm after money? i told you, my friend. anarchy. time for a change. money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
don't play innocent with me bazza; spanking!
mary, i'm amazed. didn't jacqueline tell you? she sold the business to me at least eight months ago. it's my business now.
we should just do it.
yes, but don't panic. everything's under control. have you... have you arranged our supplies?
you just did.
yes, master.  just don't turn on any radios.
shit, that's what keeps people alive.
sacha, she's had enough.
depends.  you got a memo?
huh? no.
i'm twenty-seven.
don't say that...
what kind of condition are you referring to?
of course.
we like you, too.
it's a strange world isn't it? do you know what building the woman lives in?
i'm not everybody.
i just fired bob alexander.
something happened, something...
not yet... you're like laddie and me... half-vampires... you're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... you were supposed to be mine... but i couldn't, michael.
why, sure. it's a lotta hooey.
my secretary?
i can go to the bar.
what is it if it ain't a curse?
i suppose so. she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but i don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... i guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
'cause he wasn't a rabbi.
you're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  i'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
by the way, are you sure we need a spy?
you see, that's worse.
five thousand dollars.
but the paper ...
i'm not much good at handwriting. or parties.
hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
you gonna put it away?
you are out of control. heather and kurt were a shock, but martha dumptruck, get crucial! she dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
for bravery.
if it's a suicide, i seen weirder, jim. 
marietta, i was just gonna leave and see if i could pick up their trail.
i don't think so. it's like a tv station. and they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
where are you going?
haven hamilton is your father? can you arrange an interview?
hmm!
i was the lesser of two evils.
yeah, really.
okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
now she's going out with greg barnett?
i can take care of myself.
i'm sorry. it's these goddamned shoes. i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
why do i feel i needn’t answer that?
i have.
i can see this is useless.
greetings fellow insomniac.
tomorrow, i see on the tv weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. you won't need the coat.
i need some security. i don't trust you anymore.
whatever you say, jude...
yes!
i'm sorry. i don' t want dessert. i don't want promotion. i don't want anything.
we're very upset with her.  get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call l.a.  i want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  of their <u>tits</u>.
i want you to come back with me to salzburg, my son.
i came to see merle.
...did i win some contest?
there sure is! i'm going to tell you somethin'...i wasn't going to speak of it...but i'll tell you now. did you notice them scalps strung on scar's lance?  did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? long... wavy hair...
okay, give it back.
clem, i'm sorry. i shouldn't have --
how much did you have?
why'd you live there?
i guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
you were at 4000 kelvin.  any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
managers get ten percent.
rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! we're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
no.
oh regan i love your daddy. i'll always love your daddy. burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
janet.
you sound so disapproving, midge.
i never saw him ask her for advise before.  but she volunteered plenty.
i wish i could.
i don't know. does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
i'll tell you later.
don't be ridiculous.
that thing won't come after us, right?  it's going for bigger game. the group blundering around in the basement.  poor fools.
any of it. if it can be welded i can weld it.
oh my g-d.  we were having lunch here. he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him.  i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
he tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
honest like al capone on tax day. where are my keys?
it takes money to buy food.
really? is he cute?
ask a.t.f. they might give you permission.
if you want to tell me.
you know what. you say it just to irritate me.
someone sent that message. admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
what you said.  make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
can we get some service here?
oh yeah?--my personality put this thing over--
she looks in her purse...
what about her?
i want to interview earl williams, warden. how about a little service?
sid!!!
he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he won't be back until late. you'll have to call him tomorrow. besides, i'm on my way to pick up paul.
yeah.  i'm fine.  i'm good.
uh-uh.  wait...
i've got to make at least a thousand a week.
nothing... let's get crazy!
you think he killed anybody in korea?
the same as the firs two. definitely a serial.
don't stop now! please...
you know i love spaghetti.
i'm sorry....i'm just so excited.  you must have felt this way when you first met anne, huh? where did you two meet?
this is bullshit, man.
there's a small village in hampshire, near stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. that's where i was born.  my father taught me about the training, about finding the slayers, reading the signs.  there's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  i thought so myself for a time, when i was younger...  i'm sorry.  i'm not supposed to... i shouldn't go on like this.
how do you know?
that's babar.
so.
i call myself phoebe.
what is it, hal?
yes sir.
even as a boy i thought so.
he's already gone to bed.
...'scuse me?
pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much truth he can handle.
i swear.
this is agent mackelway.
bosun!  set up mr. sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  meaning no disrespect, of course.
ben -- how old are you now?
sort of.  i'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. maybe i can get my money back.
from what?
well, that's something. i'da let you off right here.
it's been a tough day.
i did at that.
uh huh. under a safe conduct from me.
i shut it off.  what's her royal holiness want?
well, the name zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 b.c. by the ... what's that say?
no!  i...don't think so.  i stole a car and they chased me.  i hit a tree.
back in south africa...  long time ago.
a little comanche squaw - squaw!
you got more guts than me, baby. it's a no-good town.
why not? all you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
-- for over twenty years because that's what i was taught -- you stick with it! normal people don't get divorced. i can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe, for christ's sake -- quite frankly, i don't think he ever did! and now i find out in between bake sales, my mother was anais nin!
hurry... hurry... hurry.
i mean...
from a city? that doesn't make sense....
it's really happening.
well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
yeah.
merry christmas.
backup man from the east bay. worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
what?!
i know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? i need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, i'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
not on my own beat, no.
well, what are we gonna do about it now?
gotta meet a guy and head out for silverado.
what do we have?  are we showing anything?
great, mom.
didn't show up.
well, rick, after tonight i'll be through with the whole business, and i am leaving finally this casablanca.
you forgot the hula!
yes, mr. gittes?
thank you, no.
a cyclone's on it's way in.  i thought they would have told you on the phone.
so what? where's it say in this script he's white? color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. the way it is now, ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  so whatta you think of the script?
it's all clear to me now -- so clear.
you're not exactly the type we're looking for.
good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  part of your education.
once a musketeer, always a musketeer, eh?
how do you do, mr. richards.
huh!
okay, okay!  take it easy!
to know when he'll be king.
y -- what in hell starts with y?
how long has he been here...?
yes. i bought the house from her, two years ago.
the cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
she one of the women i got set up. i got melanie in hermosa beach. i rent simone a small house in compton, and about four blocks away i got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named sheronda. i found her waitin' for a bus two days outta alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. took her to my house in compton, told her it was hollywood.
i have committed no sin.
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
gaston. let's open it--right now! let's get away from here!  i don't like this place!
who is he?
it's not what you think.
i'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
leave me alone!
no, we've missed something.  we hoover again.
okay.  what's the second thing?
big enough radio, i don't see why not.
keep talking.
daddy --
i have no answers.  thanks for the stain.  find the girl.  in the envelope are tickets to the dorothy chandler.  we'll chat again, then.
does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
naturally.
quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
but that's what we're here to find out, right?
that's no secret. i'm five.
that's ok. we can call and reschedule in the morning.
different.
jesus christ, pop, let's go home. i got waylaid. sorry.
a single. just for myself, please.
mr. powell!  willa has run away!
no, it will turn out well.
there might be.
the argies.
do what you do to simone.
barton!
then, i am lucky. i am still too young.
yes.
don't bother!
and - uh - i  guess, 'goodnight'.
me?
you can't play god, son. it must end with me. just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
yeah, whoops i came.
been putting my files into it. you take sugar and milk?
i'm too old for you.
thanks...  we're taking your cab.
sure, i'm okay.
come on. where do you want to go? anywhere you want. just say it. i can get us in anywhere.
check your read-out.
you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
ron...ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
see my mother?
it's not good...
how true. but i still feel i deserve more than you do of this treasure. i mean, i found it.
yes. it's almost there.
there's an old cemetery on this road. i've been there before.
i've been working double shifts.
happy as can be. in the old groove.
i have.
he didn't mean it nasty.  he said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
yes.  i made the choice that was right for me.  and i don't regret it.  but even for me, there were days when i felt so lost, so invis- ible.  and then i'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
you're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
so maybe this is my dynamite.
what's 'at?
it's wonderful! do you think i'm ready? do you really?
wanna hear something more impressive? my first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. my girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the olympic. says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
why, lord wessex! lost your wife so soon?
like you, sweetheart. you and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. only difference is your color hair is like mine.
i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
i have of course observed the girl in treating her.
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  we'll set him up somehow.
no... but sometimes i feel that way.  what i meant was, i'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
you know the suspect?
what are you talking about?
excuse my presumption, but i do not agree. as a teacher on a training mission, i am content to command a starship. if we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
okay.
the way to stop him is to make another movie.  and i swear to you i'll stay at my computer and keep writing until i finish the script.  but when that time comes...  you're gonna have to make a choice.
at least we know he hasn't got it. just keep nodding as though i'm giving orders. saavik, punch up the data charts of reliant's command console -- hurry...
as she's a member of my staff, may i ask what this is about?
use your imagination.
the park dude was missing an arm.
i know that niche.
anti social?
oh, ellie, look.  they're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
that's her suitcase.  i had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
thank g-d.  i was starting to think i'd killed the wrong man.
i'll be on board by noon.
she's been leaving messages here too.
we've been playing ten minutes for christ sake.
because i believe in something.
betcha' didn't predict that.
i'm not sure where i can talk anymore.
well, you are his grandfather. he is supposed to spend some time with you. you're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
what you sayin' boy?
i thought i would need it.
it's not going to let us out!
all of what dewey?  you do know something, don't you?
ben is very ill.
then why does he persecute me? my family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
andy, they don't think you suck. they've just... lost a reason to love you.
no problem, man.  hey, you wanna hit?
bene.
rheya.
what happened to title dictates behavior?
those white things have taken all i had or dreamed. i'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..they just don't know when to stop.
fuck off!
nothing, captain. if they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
boy, this is good!
you can say... "hello, how are you?"... for starters.
sh!
that was the plan.  and you're thrilled to have them.
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore.
no!!!
dad!
sounds like you've been talking to mac too much.
defense network computer. new. powerful.  hooked into everything. trusted to run it all.  they say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. but if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. yes, sprang.  as an animal psychologist, i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
but you work for the casino?
like what?
that part of me is dead.
i've checked the records of jane mckenna's death -- i can't get anything special. but frank ligourin had another girl you said, besides mckenna and you.
coming to the point, please.
this is so patronizing.
no, thanks.
great, havana's great.  lots of activity in havana!  anybody i know here.  five-angels?  anybody?
it's louis.
i'm a man.
there is no weather in space.
it's griffin.
what do you know about it? i sleep where i want.
there's no end to your accomplishments.
i know.  but chances are...
yes. but first of all we'll have a little talk.
give it back to him.
it is my fate to die in the fortress.
god damn it your mom is a bitch, kyle.
how long have i been here?
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
anyplace but here.
i know, i know.
phil, i think you should consider... fades as vada walks off
why, you said...
h-hey, m-mack.
i saw brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
let it go.
why the fuck didn't you do something lieutenant!
and they didn't believe the symptoms i described...
wouldn't bother me...  i wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was i you...
--and we brought it back with us!
oh, go feel up your hamsters! i hear rodents put out.
yes.
yes. you see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. the world's full of pests. then there's the newspapers to handle. one must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
you're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
as are we all, and i'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
but how long is a day?
a crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. i use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
if that's your case, you didn't have a case.  i wouldn't believe whatever habighorst said, anyway.
i got family. ...please.
i remember when i was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  all you'd let me and lena do was set the table.  and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  and you didn't say anything. you just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
where's your shirt, mueller?
rex?  who's rex?
you're not doin' hearst, are you?
yeah. so how do i get to venice?
i hired them to. we're in my brain. but i want it to stop, before i wake up and don't know you anymore.
ah, my dear napoleon, sometimes i feel that i am not really an emperor as you are.
you gotta hear him sing.  olaf, "berserker!"
yeah, i don't know how you could make that confusion.
no.
i'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
i didn't run into you and i bet they're not your sunday clothes. you've probably got a lot of clothes.
you telephoned me to meet you. i've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
but sergeant...
'i have had a great privilege. i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon. all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham. he made me write them. now i understand.  'will graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. because i was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'i will be a testament to the truth, now.  about his work. about his becoming.'
me, too.  can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the guardhouse.  have we fed them?  like raw steak or something?
yeah, i can believe it.
well, i guess you caught me at a weak moment.
no. you baked them for whitey.
well, there it is. writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
bang sticks are like yelling at it....
i never thought you did.
sir, yes, sir!
right, then...
jody, no...
no.
deal.
i need a favor.
'cause you stink of booze.
alex, what are you doing?
then how did he know your name?
what was in the 'miami herald' and the 'times.'  confessions?
it must run in the family.
nope, there's no way.
duly noted. now, shut up.
and a beat-to-shit ak?  every twelve-year-old in nam's got one of those.
yes, intentionally.
you know what time it is, sid? it's after midnight. it's your mother's anniversary. we killed her exactly one year ago today.
depends who it's from.
jesus...
walter!
here, have a popeye's. this drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
if i was still alive, i probably would.
hell, yeah. mirror man here is our electronics expert. he's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
is this neighborly life insurance?
why didn't you say so before.
get out of my way.
no, sir.  i think the flint...
i see.
... look good on kimberly.
no, that's bad management.
well then - yes.  of course.
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery?
just do what i tell ya and everything'll be jake.
you're damn right i do.  five years down here and i'll pull in more than 15 topside.  i'm not down here for the fun, i'll tell you that.
i'm not going to vegas.
his name is.....dimitri miediev.
never said you were a hype, either.
what, "the truth"? please. there are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. things are not what they seem.
yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
yes, i do.
now wait...
all right. that's all.  please, matt.
some people might.
yeah -- when you're sixteen.
we'll work it out...
jessie, i reached the top of the tower.  so far, no sign of anyone.  looks like a phoney call. over.
wrong!  i'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  and once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and make me a woman!
yeah!  next time i tell you i'm not hung up...!
beam him out!
no, jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before i'm finished figuring it out.
i want to work today, that's why i came...
something was there.  you saw it.
fine.  we gotta him. 
i can't handle this tonight. i'm going home.
yes. dorothy -- ah -- dor --
here please.
it's just... i leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in chicago and in three dizzying weeks i've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
did he say what about?
you are.  you're losing your mind.  what about walter?
no, really, i can cope.  i can handle this lot easily!
perhaps you could convince her?
whose side are you on, cauchon?
with what?
stop whispering, sweet pea, you're giving me a hard on!
you wanna know the truth? you dumb bastard, i got it for you. look at it. goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
yes. i see you've issued each of them with a martini henry carbine. our quota for native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
nope.
you - you fuckin' moron, i'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
all right--following me.
did you go to her?
one night only. she's buried in the morning.
when's your next round?
no.
so i see.
it was you... that night in the tunnels. you. you did this to me.
what was that? i'm sorry, i didn't catch it. would you repeat it?
yes?
and i'll never understand terrorists.
of...course i do.  i just thought...i could get you another
why lie about everything else, then?
what was it?
that's it isn't it? you married the wrong woman. she leave you? was she bangin' someone else?
yes.
sit back.
aw, johnny... .
revenge! we will kill the son of our jailer!
that man keeps calling about his training film.  i can't convince him we don't have a s.w.a.t. team.
i came from the city on the left.
a toupee that flies?
what pipes?
dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  we need to get a look at sid 6.7's final profile.
i have to work on my video project! don't follow me!  i can put myself to bed.
we weren't sure we could trust you.
nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
all right. maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
an ode to spring. are there one or two "t's" in bloodletting?
what's your name?
fenster and hockney?
i'll take care of it.
don't you threaten me.
don't know.
look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  why do you want to kill more innocent people!  why!
move quickly. we are coming for you. we are in the fortress.
hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu, i'd tell her to go fuck herself.  why can't she board it?
we think it's ricky tan.  if you don't want to take the case, i'll understand.
who else would hire me?  beat you to it, didn't i?  oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
yeah.
uh-huh.
yeah, morgan. i got fired.
premature ejaculation.
try me.
<u>i'm</u> dressed.
oh, right!  right!  with those things running around.  no way.
entschuldigen sie. it was a terrible thing.
man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. jackie ain't no criminal. she ain't used to this kinda treatment. i mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in county fuck with your mind.
i don't know who i am.
it's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  it's one of your parties.
this time i'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
no.
jack. jack bangs.
it's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. not a tenable position, sir.
who do i play?
what do you mean "mass"... i have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
nobody believes it can happen to them.
your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
'tis but thy name that is my enemy; thou art thyself, though not a montague. what's montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. o, be some other name! what's in a name? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet; so romeo would, were he not romeo call'd, retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title. o romeo, doff thy name, and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself.
oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
at the muncie college of business administration.
the weather.  i see.  keep me posted.  i want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
you were?
would you read for us the time of the purchase?
tell me about the door.  do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... harry?
yes it is.
maybe at the ranch. maybe sooner than that.
it's not the first. there's been several. and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
you're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
he's probably the only one who can help us.
well, keep your eyes open. see the town?
ready.  a museum in new york sent us some additional back up.
no i wasn't.
all right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. bye.
i'm sorry. nothing under pearson.
well, i'm starving.  will you at least buy me a hamburger?
okay.
you think so?
oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. who's going to think for us? our husbands? you know, you treat mom like a maid. it's not entirely your fault. those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. but give nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
now betty, don't overreact.
yeah, do you like it?
is he oily or dry?
really?  i need a drink.  come hide with me.
tell it with pictures.  what i'm saying...
sorry, old man. work.
reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.
nothing to apologize for, casper.  you've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers--?  they'll be worried.
spirits have a way of bringing that out.
spock, you want to know something?
technique. that's right. seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. seventy-five percent. do you believe that?
graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
say it.
i'm not trying to be funny.
yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
make it our first date.
was—but—
credit?
sid, how are they hanging?
that's something, jasper.  what is it?
i waited... i would have fucking waited...
that's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
sir, if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
you wouldn't?
hitch-hiking.
call me... ishmael?
you aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  we're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
not at all.  i think we may be working on the same case.  if so, i could use your help.
it looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... that's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
you know i can't talk about that.
listen. listen, longfellow. you've got brains, kid. you'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. don't talk to anybody! these newshounds are out gunning for you.
relax.  i've flown with my old man a million times.  and he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
how will they come at you?
gibberish, my friend. he rants and he raves --
there's no one left ...
no, thank heaven.
according to the newspaper, fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus. are you familiar with the hanta virus, agent mulder?
next time tell her i've gone away.
it is easy to be sarcastic about religion. it is harder to take small hints from god, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
the three of you weren't regular patients. you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove.
the rodger young just burned up...
my mother always told me, if god had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
....she didn't, i didn't ask her out?
what?
what. what's the matter?
spare us.
okay, it's in. it's definitely in the pot!
shut up.
i'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i've never even heard of these people.
i'm buildin' a levee. gulp by gulp, brick by brick. raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
i don't know, though, i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him. but if i do go to bed with him, it's like i'm going against my own feelings. i don't know i-i can't win.
hey!
i thought you were married!
what do you mean i got money? i'm as broke as you.
you're too involved marty.  jesus look at you. why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
by what name are you known?
you're not a permanent part of her life.  you're a distraction.
trust me. they won't recognize me.
thass right. just play it...
you don't throw guests out, brandon.
a glamorous young lady way above his station...
by reading the book of the dead.
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
yes?
they had to be dealt with!
okay honey.
yes, your majesty.
on my way. please notify commander riker.
they're going to love you.
yeah.
he drowned.  anyone could see.
piece of cake, baby.
i hardly know him.  he wanted me and he couldn't have me.
i'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
what!  don't give me that crap you little weenie.  how do i know you ain't gonna take a powder.  you come to a game like this, you bring your money.
you cannot, wessex will kill you
not half as bad as i feel.
yeah, i get it.  time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, harp?
don't call me that confounded name, i tell you.
i understand, dick.
what happens if he doesn't have his medication?
her life is in your hands, dude. and report back to us as soon as it's done.
you're the one that put us together. we're friends.
i'm upset too, zee, but jesse and cole know what they're doing. i'm sure they won't press their luck.
go ahead! they love you just about as much as i do.
hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? oh, i forgot, it's not big enough.
yeah, but i don't know --
- type o.
how'd he die?
i suppose.
i need your truck!
how can i?
uh-huh.
well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  bein' here together an all...
oh... this and that.
help you out?
look...
i might have his number on campus.
i can cry on cue.
ok... and if it's you who gets killed?  ...then?  talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? she's here! she moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. because it was your day, your hour, your second...
billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
who are you apologizing to?
it does.
i am not doing hearst.
oh, now you're saying lyndon johnson was involved?  the president of the united states?
chaz -- what happened to broussard?
like i'm supposed to know what that even means.
are you crazy?  the joint is crawling with cops now.  you wanna go to rikers?  go to the hoosegow?
you don't know the how, mr. vesci. and that's not the half of it.  i've got your money, and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
well, that's alright. i understand you. now, say the whole thing again, hello ...
i have to obey him... because he saved my life. he controls me and i have to obey him or i'll be left all alone... and i'll never figure out what all of this means...
in five years?
sounds like a game show host to me.
it's not mammalian, that's for sure. i think it's reptilian.
in three days, darling, i hope.
there's a lot of choices here.
awright! how bout you, glass, how's that chip shaking?
no, why?
and <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal homecoming...?
looks like you'd make a good runner.
something's on.
now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
i don't want to see the dress.
pay no attention to this swine. he can't handle the medicine. 
and how will you make him keep it?
yeah, i hate to go alone. you know, i like to talk film; discuss the critique. d'you wanna see a film with me? i got passes to the crest. it's othello.
i'm so sure!  i'm an only child and my parents are bill and shirley petals of south bend, indiana. they run a hardware store and...
let me get a shot of it.
don't concern yourself, martin. this boy needs treatment.  we're taking care of it.  sorry for the disturbance.
while i'm gone, tell them about our cousin lenny who's gay. we knew from when he was five.
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
much.
hello.  so very boring.  peter parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
i'll take that under consideration, your honor.
c'mon.  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  she sees me differently.
you don't see what's going on here, do you?  there's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas. lives have been lost. no suspects have been named. so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. that the fbi didn't do its job.
well, wasn't all me, y'know.
no trouble.
what crate?
a fine specimen for conversion.
are you <u>kidding</u>?  it is <u>so</u> much better than the one rachel showed me!
he's here, sheriff.
colonel hamilton.  anyone who served under arnold, i want them shipped north.  i don't want any troops here who served under arnold.
so you're going to kill him?
the candelabras were my gran's.
i have to go home and get my things.
to find the rest of your family before michael myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
i can handle it.
yeah.
this isn't reality. this is fantasy.
oh. i'm sorry. gideon, what do you say?
oh, come on now rozengurtle. i was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
huh! and they say charity’s only rewarded in heaven... hallelujah...  christ...
okay.
really?
what'd you do?
what kind of a boy are you? boys always have candy.
oh yes, i was getting to that, your honor.
terry was telling me about you on the plane. it was all so interesting.
i never knew my mother.  my father died when i was nine.
i see. and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin?
i don't-don't know how they get through life. it's amazing to me.
the best he can since you gave him nothing.
i'd love to, it'll have to wait until i get back.  i have to leave.
better watch yourself claude, before you say something you regret.
ah... he was hurt bad.  bullet nicked an artery... i don't know... an hour... hour and a half...
who knows? it's all lower-brain-stem- activity. the heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. this guy's a fighter. every time the valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
that was the general idea i intended to convey.
i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret, mr. crawford. truth will out... and then what? will you give johns hopkins a new identity? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
listen, runt--quick! where's the ice?
well, from italy to iowa -- that's a story!  whereabouts in italy?
it's fine, but --
show yourself.  the real you. the secret you.
call me crazy, but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. what else? you gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
i liked it.  he's not afraid to be human.
he will.
should we close down any eruption?
he wanted to see me again.
that was before he pulled this 'dick me or i dump you' shit. i say fuck his best friend.
with a sitter.  we have a sensational sitter.  jonah's really comfortable with her.  you know, a second mom sort of. like part of the family.  amazing with kids.
don't be callous.
oh, thank you. thank you very much.  here.
that there isn't one, as of today. i had my period.  i couldn't believe it. he still wanted to marry me.
not at all.  you have your life.  and i have mine.
no. i was just researching. calm down.
betty elms.
i lost another fork tonight. she's getting suspicious, i know it.
i, uh.
put it on the screen.
keep charley out of this.
yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
oh. it's fine. what's another ten pounds?
you were a cop.
thank you.
hi princess.
put it on ready to play, and i'll tell you when to play it.
i think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
the old crew. go find them. i can't help you with that. since i've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
if anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  you are a disappointment, jerome.
well, i've seen him here and there. what's on your mind?
there was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
ben.
dinner at my place then ? say, seven o'clock ?
the grand duchess swana... active in the white russian movement?
they like dr. pepper.
i must have miscalculated. how. . .
i must follow the slayers. they've taken lyssa.
my car's in the garage.
oh yeah?  anytime, anytime.  just go ahead and try it.
i'll take it!
you think this is just about politics?
you're asking me a direct question?
no name.  you sure ask a lot of questions.
then go find her, donnie. don't let her get away.  she was right about the rabbits. go.
me too.
mr. kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
listen, jesse, we've got a problem.  it's cole.
if god wants me to win, he will find a way.  and if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  then i'll be with him forever.
your guess?
oh, uh, listen, david called me up.
good luck then.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve.
now i want to live forever.  i've never felt so strong or happy.
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
about the past year.
shit, i ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  that does nothin' for me.  no. i don't need to be pattin' no ass. all i'm sayin' is, how do i know you're not a cop?
what did he buy?
hey...
what's your favorite movie star?
a night on the town instead of under it?
our greater goal is more important, brother.
yeah.  some of it was fun.
hmmm... she's beneath me, i'm afraid.
black.  jack.
she stole my car!!
no. she's gone.
not really.
i'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  you're still in command.  clayton forrester!  i haven't seen you since oak ridge.
birds are not bad!
yes.
"oh, laura..."
see, that's the problem with terrorists.  they're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
no...
i know, i know. but there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
i changed my mind. i'd pick the dangerous one.
it's a folk song.
you weren't straight with us, frankie, what else could we do?
it was a different floor then...
you'll have to watch jamie tonight.
he's the head of the family.
what a filthy mess.
is it?
you want to know the real kicker?  the real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--i feel like a loser.
there you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
could you have ruined yourself somehow?
the population must increase with great rapidity.  we give a couple seven years to raise a family. if, by that time, there is no branch upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel.
then don't.
a thank-you?  for what?  you're the one we should be thanking.
grandmama pace had a long, smooth white neck. it was like on a statue it was so white?
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit.
hand me a towel.  i'm getting out.
when?
'it's up to joe'?  those were his words?
no thank you, quince.  i'm sorry, honey.  i'm no good at this.  why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
there's nothing wrong with max.  i don't know why you don't --
we proceed, representing your estate.
they don't notice that kind of thing.
go back to your quarters  that's an order.
still, it must be kinda rough.
i know what you went through tonight.  i kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
you're lying! you'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! you'll be killed the moment you're seen!
i don't know <u>anything</u>.
it's too far!
i saw the sign.
no.  there is another chip.
i thought for sure they would catch me.
who is it?
no, benjamin. i don't hate him. unhook my blouse.
yeah? and what are you going to do tonight?
turn around?
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. it's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
oh no! one hears such sounds and what can one say, but - salieri!
well, you go down beechwood...
the way we figure it, barbara flies to boston twice a week.  two bags per flight.  twenty-five pounds in each bag.
guns.   can you get them?
chief, i swear, we tore that bus apart. they couldn't have...
mm-mm.
those are tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
i told you i don't know nothin' and i ain't saying nothin'.
bapu -- please. where are you going.
grace, tell him.
that girl you boned last year. remember?
and you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as misery chastain.  like a baby.  all done. 
not that i can see.
whose then?  lindsey?  talk to me...
your daddy is a wonderful man, i'll say that. he's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
that's strange isn't it? not remembering one fever... or a cold... or a sore throat. what do you think that means?
new card. what do you think?
so you got pinched in the elevator. so what?  would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
my wife just went into labor...
who?
more beautiful with each passing minute...
uh, i don't, honey. branding? oooh... i think we'd just be in mr. booker's way.
what did you just say?
sinatra?
i was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. but i'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. that's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. there's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. and that's us. who we were and where we come from.
erica? she said she was tired. she went back to the hotel.
well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  i'm sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
they drive so recklessly there.
gabriel -- !
sorry.  if i did, i didn't mean to.
at seven-thirty?
unguent.
he's gone?
no, really, i am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. i hope you won't take it personally.
can't i take a simple piss without --
move over ...
i have no interest in ever looking at you, hector.  could you please cut me down?
it'll be okay, baby, i'll hold your hand.
it was just an idea.
not necessarily.  he could go off road at any number of places.  he might not even be in the country anymore.
any criminal record?
no, it's not.
do you have a salon prive?
your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in rio.
this is fifty bucks.  i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
who?
no. we can't.
now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? i hope she didn't see me.
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  this time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  the moment when contact becomes possible.  we've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
indisposed, sir.
because i'm sick and tired of her little games.  because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. because i've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
yes you can.
not at all.
you have to!  listen!  all viruses pass on their own dna.  instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  this one was different.  it inserted a whole array of genes into john.  reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  those genes remade him!  it's not his fault!
i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
twenty. you knock off twenty and then we see. after my guy looks at it.
feel like practicing?
about that luggage.  where's the phone?
and, i'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
plot a course for kronos, lieutenant.
i guess not.
well, anyway, don't get crazy.  i'll do something for zenovich's wife.
bullshit!  he's got to know damn well i cut it!
i'm sorry, it's just...i've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
phoned some friends, sir?
oh, buddy, i've never had someone be so protective of me!
yeah. it's quiet--
oh no, stifler, what did you do?
but i'm blind.
the donor.  maybe he's alive inside the game.
what about mrs. moebius and...?
okay.
not at all. that's alexander hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. those are his exact words, gentlemen. character!  it's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
that was one of them?
aren't you going to watch with me?
izzat so?
thanks, mick -- i'm gonna try.
your secret admirer?
i didn't say i was scared.
rock and roll, gus.  johnny boz.
oh yeah, baby, i'll give it to you.
and it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  did it?
poppy, please --
second of all, the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
a very wise man once said...i think it was attila the hun... "it's not enough that i succeed. everyone else must fail."  and you are going to do it for me.
that's a movie, you moron.
you think you are... .
can you stand?  we've got to get out of here before those tuskens come back.
i know --
did you try?
i agree. and for that service i charge one dollar taxi fare.
uh huh. 'fraid so.
i think i came. didn't you feel it?
you've got a <u>phone</u>?
sssh. what is it? tell me.
i guess.
i certainly did, sir...
fuck, man! i may as well have posted flyers. right out in public, man.
but it hasn't been forever. 
what kinds of questions?
maybe that's the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.
yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
on the nose!  i said place.  place it on syphon.  that horse is going to run second.
like what?
i do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  i would hate to see master luke develop a short circuit ...
well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. the beatnicks were before my time, and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
yes. is that so surprising?. yeah i worry. a lot. i got you into this.
so you...
sure.
i told you, i don't know.
a fairy--a queer.  everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
- an understudy's performance.
to yours.
bomb?
got a minute? i... need a little counseling.  first time for everything. do i... lie down... or what?
no problem.  do you want to come in?
it's mine.
is that right? well, listen to this: drag your ass. this is a restricted area.
go back to the light.  you weren't made for this.  i was... i was made for this moment.
that's it!
it's all right. hey, it's all right. we'll be right here, right with you.
yes!!!
yes.
he' s confused--
trent, i don't feel like going out tonight. i got shit to do tomorrow...
oh, for god's sake, phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?
well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  i mean, nothing really happened.  we just... took a walk.
look, i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
not at all. and you could do me a big favor, if you would-
and all alive you say?
your majesty has had many women --
wait a minute.  the president!!  that's it! the president!!!
they come. they come and pushed me off.
steady as she goes...
what did it look like?
whoa.  don't touch that.  <u>pursuit</u> <u>mode</u>.  auto pilot.  computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  installed fall 2006.  underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
yes.
you being cynical, hennessy?
apparently i've overlooked this one piece of it, and i'd like to remedy that. you see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
yes, bill.  the question.
i have no extraordinary powers.
'n daniel webster will be there.
that's what we should've done in the first place.
well, gee, i try and have a heart.
the lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
a dressing bag.
were you followed?
what do you mean -- ?
i don't know.
i'm thinking it's too weird now.
which one would you like to join, luthor? pick a hole.
that actually goes on...
what?
the best friend i ever had.
no, you're not.
you're leaving me here alone?
but, jake, i was just...
i am not.
oh, yes. yes. about my throwing those people out of my house. mrs. pomponi told the truth. i did throw them out because i didn't want the party in the first place. i didn't invite anybody. mrs. pomponi did all that. they just came to see what kind of a freak the "cinderella man" was. i don't know how people like that are supposed to act, your honor, but if that pomponi woman is an example, i'll stick to simple folks. she just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. if i were a friend of hers, i'd have her examined.
right.
no.
i told you, all bets are off.
we have to do something. what can we do to help, selina?
you were great the other night.
kill them! kill them!
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
well, i give to the united way, and i feel that sort of covers --
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
good. except for pms.
not a tiny little vial -
she seems rather an odd woman to me.
i seen it, but i don't believe it. says harry shot ronnie five times. four to the chest and one through his foot.
"then they'd put you in jail."
they're not going to--
are you juno, our case worker?
hey...lance....can i.....
dr. juttson, please take kelly back to camp right away.  leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
but surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
that's great... little early for cartoons, isn't it?
i'm only here until twelve, then i'm gone. the boss is coming in.
i don't know megan.
that's right. now who needs to trust who ? trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, i'll put you in the hot seat.
because he was scary, that's why.
they got a lucky break. yesterday they were just two german clerks. today they're the 'honored dead'.
then why'd you call me?
we have.
yeah, good old spiro.  well, better him than me.  what the hell is he but an insurance policy?
no, keep trini out of this. chotiner's too old.  and for god's sake, keep colson out.  it's time to baptize our young counsel.  that means dean can never talk about it.  attorney-client privilege.  get to it.  and dean -- you stay close on this.
where was your father born?
and you can see how you feel about me, right?
what are the delusions like?
two years.  two long fucking years.
i don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
don't worry, four eyes.
what'll it be fletch?
that's nice. send me a post card.
that's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. bit i don't think that's her.
you're a lucky guy.
damn, man, i give up.  your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
rutherford auction... that name...
you quit.
what is it?
i'm eleven and a half.
nay.  this is a private affair, no audience welcome... better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
good and bad.  they think that's what caused this.  me eye tumor. microwaves from the screen.  it's the size of a grapefruit.  heavy too.
that's one of the plagues, right? the grasshopper plague!
well, i did. every one of them. mostly i remember the last one. a wow finish. a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
you're an extraordinary fighter. i hate to lose you.
coffee'd be nice.
we'll be okay once she realizes i'm not a new toy.
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles.
precise equipment… such as waldos…
is that cool? just to leave her like that?
and they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the skipper?
yeah. the graduation dance mr. hand. it's the last school event of the year.
the mean old man with the claws.
he said, 'don't mind him. his job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
...please... no...
so how come you could play basketball?
not a thing.
i think i'd better go tomorrow.
i dunno, but i don't think we need him. dump him at the lights.
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
oh, sugar.  you're going to spoil my surprise.
really?
and you're a nice man, quince.
but that was her order!
i...
i'll call thelma and remind her, okay?  don't worry.
okay.
michelle strigo. loan officer.
later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!
i'm sorry honey. i got behind.
he's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
i mean, it's a good story.
we're both of us damned, my beauty.
well, i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me.  some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
all right, calloway. you win.
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
that is why they call it coach?
i told you we know each other, baby. mr. massey represented my ex-brother- in law. martin reiser?
can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
you think you're so slmighty -- smart -- who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
go breaker.
oh, but it's a good story, shadow. you're depriving our famous young friend here...
if you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
no. home here.
i have all day.
not likely.
do you like my body?
book code?
john hammond.
i'm sorry, that's all there is.
are you and mom getting a divorce?
do you know what you're saying?
i shouldn't have listened to you, i should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
one. here, in front of my ear.
everything okay?
stop it, dil --
so what else is new?
this baby's got a few surprises left in her.
malcolm, where are you? we've been calling all over the city.
good for you, miss winch. you now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
you were not baptized.  at least i don't believe it was christian.  your baptism was performed by your uncle, james mckenzie.
so why are you telling me this?
you didn't show it to anybody?
a friend of yours is here.
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
yeah, we check you into mt. hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. you can pull your pants up now.
are you totally stupid?  what does it look like?
at being a fake.
it was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
what's he saying?
is that what you think?
he was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since i was young.
what if i don't have anything happy from childhood...sorry, i can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  which is over seven hundred feet a second. imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
tribuus... tomorrow.
i can really rape them on this!  can i at least tell them you'll think about it?
quite a week.
what's the matter with you?
that's right.
where are you taking us?
he is your brother!
you were asleep.
alright. i'll be right up.
mind your own goddamn business... she comes in a lot?
okay, here it is.  eldon tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  the cat is about to get out of the bag.  pressure is definitely on.  the nexus program is terminated.  when you finish there, locate nexus designated rachael and retire.
c'mon, babe! you know what i like... easy!
yeah.  he's around somewhere.
don't worry about it. you've got friends now, remember? just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
aw, come on. be a sport. just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
i hope so, sir.
well... miss channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as i should be, really - not that i've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when i heard mr. fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
somewhere down there?
to marry you.
you! you're lucky i didn't fire you. i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
forget it.
is it really your camper?
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
you would have killed his brother?
power levels quite low, sir.
heaven on earth?  master, i don't understand.  a temple, where heaven is on earth?  a mountain, where earth reaches for the --
ok, then.  keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
laura, you didn't come and see me today.
you're a wonderful man. two o'clock is a good time. here's the key in case he's asleep. open the curtains for him, so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
you're safe.  we've come to get you out of here... just relax.
so sensitive.
<u>ear plugs</u>.
used you?
and i want doucet.
susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  rachel?
i know who he works for. where's your phone.
lingerie.
how do you know?
cut it out!
no.
hello, beautiful.
i know this part, keep reading.
of course.
hold on –
lieutenant, actually. lieutenant jonathan scrimm. i'm the head of the resurrection protective force.  and you are?
resurrection.
there's no reasoning with him.
i didn't --
and then what?  half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! you know that!
yeah, i got that. some people think it's all in their heads.  it's been so bad she's had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and i'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
you better believe it if you know what's good for you!
that's what we want to find out.
it's okay, quince.  i understand. you've always meant well and i appreciate that.  sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv. thunder rumbles. theo takes sheila by the shoulders.
somewhere.
naw.
how about me what?
hello.
okay.
you're bobby, right?
no!
i want everybody out of here. we'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
i think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. what you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. i went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. he's weak, he's incompetent. he jeopardizes the whole place. there's not much more i can do for him.
what i want to do!  right now. what is really inside of me.
didn' you have no breakfast?
would you call him a capable man?
now? what about the boss? he's not gonna like it.
she's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
tell me what you were gonna say. go ahead.
can't hurt.  and i think it's important you find out what she wants.
cocksucker! 
bear with me here...
they're...pretending to dress.
well, i'm a working girl, mr. gittes. i didn't come in to see you on my own.
and a fact is a fact.
are you a spirit too?
thank you. it is rather late... and i'm not young anymore. good night.
goodnight.
i'll go for that.
they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there. he mention keyser soze
oh, yes, doolittle, i'm thinking.
mr. whale, this is such an honor. you're one of my favorite all-time directors.  i can't believe i'm meeting you.
can i just say, i thought 'ghost' was a wonderful film.
i saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... mikey loved it. made me promise to get him one. will you live on the boat?
ma'am, ray dunbar's black.
oh... not a real doctor.
but i thought he came over to america before the war.
all of you?
just a minute.
it isn't fair. i'll give you one of my favorite cats... a jellicle cat.  "jellicle cats have cheerful faces, jellicle cats have bright black eyes; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise."
c’mon, as soon as i put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
but your people... neri... rocco; you don't think...
it hurts too much to care.
just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
that's because your union bosses <u>are</u> those guido mother-fuckers.
franco mother-fucking harris!
what're you doing here anyway?
-- waiter! where's my cobb salad?  you want advice ben? if your big brother were still alive i'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
i know!  i know!
what'd he say?  where's the hand- off?
good... pass the beer.
go back to the car and keep brian there. i don't want him in here...  do it adele... now!
you remember miriam....
oh, him. well, he died.
i meant to ask you something, mills, when we spoke on the phone.  i can't help wondering... why here?
let's have dinner first.
yeah, mac?
what if i chant?
no! no! don't touch it. that's a very important work of art. what the bloody hell do you want?
that i did it again.
same.
do i?
around one.
gee, thanks!
watch me.
i don't know.  hey bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
not again, fellas. it kind of hurts.
hah.
i can tell you this.  i recognize his lawyer.  his name's mark swarr.
the ship needs its captain.
hey, screw you! okay? you think i'm just somebody you can buy off! listen, let me tell you something--
seven.
you must have known it would happen. you couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  like you said, i've been living with the guy.  we were bound to get around to it sometime.
how do you know?
okay, fine. sure
this ice will break yet.  how's our guest?
... very good, sir.
good night, john.
i, i don't know.
and i thought you were a bright woman.
what money?
listen to me-
fuck you!  do you hear me, john!? fuck you!  john . . . john!?
what?
i don't want you dead, woman, i want the the truth!
no. i should go.
they sent us to tell ya. we pulled the detail.
they're just people. alright? they got feelings, you know?
hey, rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
yes. we went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some mafia guy.
forty bucks...
there's no fucking reason--here's my point, dude--there's no fucking reason--
i'm such an asshole.
i think we'll have to send our friend wheeler a cable, mr. bernstein.  of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  let me see -  mike!
no. but the photo on his license looked familiar. i think he's been in the bar before
that's right, homer. this ain't your business.
no...
it's a lung cancer issue
look blair, maybe you're right about this.  but we've got to be rational. we've got to talk this over.  i'm unarmed and i'm coming in.
well, don't over-do it.  i don't want people saying, 'there goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
yes! yes! i was thinking that, too. no. i was feeling it. all i needed was to hear you say it! amen! i'll help them.
come on dorothy.
that you would trip on your barbie heels and i'd get named prom queen?  did i say that out loud?
no one's gonna blame you. c'mon. take my hand and save yourself, carolyn.
i see that.
motherfucker...
well, i think i remember reading the report on that.  wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
how much?
dead on all channels.
uhura, you did what was necessary.  keep trying. you'll find him...
former kgb surveillance post. the dye factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
bar across the street.
what...
it was a powerful air.
my client is an entrepreneur.  i am his lawyer, not his business manager.
do you?
so, tibet, too, needs to define itself.
no, you don't! get this clear: socking people is no solution for anything.
it's a thought.
no.  you don't have any reason to think that...
i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
um-hum ...
if you were me, i'd kill us both. c'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
in my work? yes. calculated risks. you have to.
i don't mind. if you think he can hold me.
it's not the english way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, mr. dugan, i'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and i resign all claims to this young lady.  if she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
little slow tonight.
you didn't answer my question. what are you doing?
perry, stand by on the rov.  sorry about this, little buddy.  better you than me, know what i mean?
i've got news for you. it's not working.
well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
and one of 'em is sick.
well, that's a load off.
not much.
why?
yes.
no, i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
huh?
unka unka unka unka unka.
hunh.
what?
i have to find a way to get to soran.
i love marge.
it's fantastic -- it's too much.
sylvia plath.
a number for the whole group, or for us?
suppose that lednov was to have found you, instead of me. why you wouldn't have had a chance.
you can stop it right now.
what can <u>i</u> do, doctor rumack?
can you handle it?
five hundred dollars.
kiss me hardy.
stop saying you know when i say 'y'know.' i know you know.  yes, i know you're here, otis. what do you want, a brass band?
lansky. meyer lansky. and that's bugsy siegel ya got there.
maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
nobody asked you to.
it's not so bad.
what's that you say?
it's your hand, buckaroo.
of course.
who won?
nothing you can do. been like this for days.
it's a bathtub. what she's standing under.
i thought you were a businessman.
yeah!
somebody find him a knife.
clues?  what kind of clues?
a daughter.
i thought i was a widow. my husband ... the only man i ever loved ... is dead. for the rest of my life i have to live with that.
i have arranged transportation.  we meet soon.  but i think you to be disappointed.
i'm fine, right. fit as a fucking fiddle.
yeah.
how would you know <u>anything</u>?
just turn right here.
so jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
hey, little dale evans.
there's nothing here.
fuck you; i gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. you lie		   * to yourself! you don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. so you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
you really think it would make a difference either way?
if the subs aren't here yet, sir --
you're a tough nut to crack, dylan.
somerset maugham.
you've got a lot of nerve.
you could consecrate with her, my friend.
uh huh.
what are the other reasons?
ask, you're the girl reporter.
oh, please.  destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
see who i got in there. gotta get somebody i can trust.
i'm ready to communicate with you now.
away from the piano, tita, you have no sense of time at all.
i've already made arrangements.
where did you see it?
yes. on my torso.
well, i'm glad you got it out of your system. congratulations. mission accomplished.
pretty bad.
god i guess i'll have to introduce you now.
he’s not through yet. renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. he’s working for someone. someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  and they hired the perfect killer. one with a vendetta against king...and you.
they have plotted against me!  me! the embodiment of god's will!
no. thanks anyway. i've got to get over to the office.
what about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
howdy, mr. grant. you goin' to the deer cheer this weekend?
it was a mistake.  this isn't a plot to do in otis.
think again, miss swann. vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. i intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
lab experiments? right smart guy -- paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- in fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, i think you should...
pick me up at my father's house at around seven. and don't be late this time.
what do you know about the ear? anything?
you went to school with these people.
i'm putting you on the coin... your essence... that way you'll always be with me when i dive.
right.
got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. except you gotta do it right. i mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. and who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. you could be there all fuckin' night.
what kind of stupid question is that?
...i want you to do it on the outside, too.
get her back!  i've got to go in!  get me a full anesthetic, stat!
agnes?  who?  mother superior?
look!
the word i'm searching for i can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
they were partners.
then you got undressed.
i don't understand this... i don't understand this one bit. he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. somethin' bad has happened - i jus know it.
i'm irish.
read you.
yeah, everybody thought so.  but me and teddy got a kick out of toons.  all toons.  we couldn't see the bad in 'em. and when this guy was accused of knockin' over the first national bank of toontown, we took his case.  but when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  we went to his house to take him in.  but he was wise. he got the drop on us... literally.
the one i'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
uh, yeah... i'll bring it down.
only two? man, i already done eight. nothin' to it. just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
you loved her, didn't you?  you really loved her.
nothing we can do, man.
and you play cricket?.
you sound like the tourists. know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  fuck you.  you won't make it off this mountain.
really?  what do you do there?
i know of him.
why?
no, tell me.
yes, i believe he has --
who is v'ger?
maybe.  who cares?
they came back?
you'd have been proud of her.
what?
his hands reach out and choke me all the time he mumbles slowly.  truth... truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
i don't understand the song. tell me plain how they did it.
right, mom. and i'm still a virgin!
she's not irena's child -- there's nothing of irena in her. she's my child.
you idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
'night miss jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
now don't josh. this is a very big day for you, paul. here. you just sit tight, and i'll set everything up.
maybe he doesn't know...
and, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. he has more concentration than anybody i've ever met. it's spooky how he can concentrate.
well, i didn't mean it.
what's that?
maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. they probably don't think anyone would dare try.
i don't know, sir.
plenty of times.
open the door.  it's me.
i would, mr. doyle!  are you game?
i dunno...
no lightspeed?
black's fine.
i thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
i mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  it's bad enough i have to get old, but doin' it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  i mean, i don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
i think they're fantastic.
biederman!
where'd you go to school, kid.  wellesly?
sorry, mac, i can't. yeah, mac. sure, but i ain't the attorney—
right.
we'll take it! will it fit?
that guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
thank you.
may i ask...?
it isn't a story - it's true.  i did see wynant.  he's not dead.
sorry... i was distracted.
you mean alex.
i'm alright.  and you?
you're as bad as the rest of them, elaine!  it's all here in the design specifications!  look!  it's all here!
of course.
if you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
...aven't you?
no, they don't, do they?
okay.
uh, uncle ben, i--
the other guy drew first.
naw, not you.  it can't be.  that hottie sloan hopkins.
zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
i'll do it.
i guess.
yes mother.
me too.
sir!  no sir!
it's a big part of the show.
olive. - where exactly am i?
annie's a smart lady.
you're a lawyer and you're here--
a girl needs protection.
they'll make it look like an accident...
and what do you think mendez?
oh hi, what can i do for you?
let me have that one. where's the nearest hardware store?
you're insane!
no it's not. it was jason.
but horror stories!  why all the time horror stories?
cherry-red tears, your first book. i read it at least nine times.  and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
you got me all confused.
more like a week. look, i'll be back.
we've got nothing, bob.  this won't work.
no, i think your mother, her illness --
no harry, you can't.
mon captain, it's for you. 
i see them, prof. everywhere. they're invading my life.
remember who my brother is?
you're putting me in a difficult position.
to sound like big macho cops. he was probably just found with a knife in his back.
what?
who are you?
i'm just getting started....
you might find the truth rather hard to understand.
no, no.  i saw eight geese flying in a "v".
i've searched the entire world for you, buffy.
ten minutes ago.  didn't you hear me calling?
what's in here?
you sure?
did he ever marry the girl? did he ever go exploring?
quiet!
i'll lick the stamps.
well, here you are.
not likely.  there must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
paul could pop the question at any time.
i mean really never.
...and i thought you loved me.
my god.
i cut myself.
the dogs?
p.  dad?
are you kidding? i'll be down in a "i-crapped-my-pants."
am i right or am i right?
i know that i shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to joseph.
yes?
just trying to get to my boat...
maria...
it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
it's a living.
why?
what ?
okay, now. easy steps. easy breaths. easy steps.
how do you do, mr. worley?
what money?
noooo....
i shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when i was a boy, i had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
they ran.  as fast as they could. caught a train.
<u>i did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. i must be senile. mr. saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
how're you doin' today?
they know what you want, believe me. pretending is just a waste of time. you're gonna take them there eventually anyway. don't apologize for it.
yeah, bring it on!
well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
when you've been in the system as long as i have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
yeah, what'd you tell him?
show you right on a map.
you're wrong.  you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. put that gun down.
all right, he's on final now! put out all runway lights except niner.
what happened?
it's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
the bridge...?  i'd better get going!
of course not.
you try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. this is some new form of torture. say it, brother, sir.
frankie ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
it works a little.
that's right, sir -- i come from new orleans -- i was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. we specialize in sauces; my whole family. it's what we do. i was supposed to go to paris and study at the escoffier school; i was saving the money. they called me for my physical so i figured the navy had better food.
what the hell are these?
how do you know that?
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
i don't know what you're talkin' about.
no, thank you.
well, if she looked like you -- say! my brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
maybe i won't.
you mean teach you how to play. can't. going fly fishing in canada, big client...
nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  not you or jeffrey or anybody else.  you've created something in your mind, james -- a substitute reality. in order to avoid something you don't want to face.
you stole this truck.
i did another one last night.  you might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
it doesn't matter. it was the feeling i was affected by.
mr greenleaf.
my old man split along time ago.  it doesn't mean anything.  you just take care of number one that's all that matters.
what does it mean?
she won't even see me, mickey. now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but i'm gonna tell ya somethin'. since you two've been sentenced, mallory hasn't spoken one word.
i love you so much, and i hate this war so much. oh, it's a crazy world. anything can happen. if you shouldn't get away, i mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever i'll be, i want you to know...
well?
he's pretty... remarkable.
you're not going anywhere...  sam...
what?
dream?!
is that right, dad?
i'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
i treated you better.
a simple 'please' would suffice...
it was pretty bad, huh?
what do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
i don't know how you do it, aud... i sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
you!
just phone calls, right? they ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. kids getting kicks. burglars looking for an empty apartment. i mean there is nothing that proves --
don't think about it, toto. don't even try. with feelings, there's nothing to understand.
might, if i was asked... 
you ever lose somebody stephanie?
isn't everything?
uh-unh, no, it's different... it's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  you get it?
then you got undressed.
all i need--
...what do you mean?
your decision. for us.
i'm just going to my car?
i seen the angel of death ned, an' i seen the river.  he's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
huh?
still, i hope i behave on the moon.  i'll stick close to you.
sorry.  too perfect.
the glades motel?
i'm grateful, frank.  how much? for the singer.
on the bridge. how did you know that tommy had your dog? that was no fucking hunch.
not yet, the wife in working on our first.  you got any kids back on the ranch?
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
bob! get back in position!
yes -- oh!
i don't even know if i should be doing this. it's a very expensive car.
what do you want?
no!
a wife?
yes. tell me about the day you got off the train.
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago. if he's got twins this morning, i claim it was done with mirrors.
how the hell did he find it?
but, why?  tell me why.
yeah, like a church. church of the good hustler.
what?
asks my name.  over and over.  just like a broken record.  only thing is, i can't answer.  i've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
just what you see. a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
shall we vote him in, stella?
more antiques for your collection -- cheers!
ninety five percent?  just give me the money now.
in the knee?
i was working with a boy named eugene.
what's that?
... i know it's you, bruce. i'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
forget it.
well, i'll try and get that clarified. as i understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
quiet, everyone! hush! shhh!
what?
i just know.
i don't think she can do it. you saw what happened.
salary. unreported income.  by the way, what time is it on bellagio road?
nobody wants war. i'd just like to keep the threat alive.
you want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
victor. this place looked like a charnel house. what went on here?
i was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and lieutenant singh…
... good night, chauncey.
what?
what?
no, i love her, we will be a family. i have her piano. i will mend it, she will get better.
this whole thing is a joke!
i'm sorry, viv'.  carlos has been on my back.  did you get the money up front like i taught ya'?
the marines.
better?
were you listening to the story, donny?
i was hopin' you would. i know that night by heart. sometimes, honey? i think it's the best night of my life.
tch, oh.  i always told you you would leave me.  but...does it have to be now?
there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days. four a day. what do you think about that, mr. creasy?
we'll be better off in the open. if we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
have you got one or haven't you?
- and picked us up in the states -
east? east above the river heading for the eagle pass?
you check it....
rhodes, you and i had a roll in the hay together when i first got here. it was a wholly unsatisfying experience which i do not want to, and which i never will repeat! so give up, mister! i'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
gloria -- sell the house.  
how was it?
i stole your beat, huh? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
peter, what about the bathtub?
do you know... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here.
i told you i don't know anything about any fucking set up. i've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! i don't know anything! you can torture me if you want -
it's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
i don't care, i've changed my mind.  ... i feel <u>really</u> confident.  we're getting better at this stuff.  we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  i've got an idea.  you're going to love it... i'm going to hate it.
nothing's going to happen.  besides, i have to work tonight.  the conference is in less than two weeks. i've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  this is...
that's all, ned. thank you.
thank you, sergeant.
you should know how it works.  just in case.
wait, wait, can i at least have his body?
double homicide.  a year ago. las halloween.
again?! jesus!
nobody asked you to.
you want to know what your problem is, jeff? you want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. it's true. look at you. you're gullible and you're gutless.
i am sort of scattered.
you're going to settle out of court?
yeah, the fucking lawyer.
furthest point i could find from new york.
she ever go with them? like salvy?
we all, had to look at the body. it was awful, kiki -- awful!
there is no fuckin' set up!  look, this is the news. blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. white and pink come with me, 'cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
ever read any poe?
is there a part for me?
keep your voice down.
i'm going home!
john thinks it's very dashing. something no gentleman should be without. i'm inclined to agree.
you are good to me sam.
so why tell me now?
so the defendant was encouraged to hope.  or could have been.
sir te!  it has brought him as much trouble as glory.  help him to leave these troubles behind. otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
i can hit those boys from here. we just need a distraction.
jack, i --
she don't say she is, but i figure she is -
should never have come out. i should've stayed there, fought with them.
almost a christmas scene.
yeah.
well... it's the only one i have. it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
you think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
ehh.
i defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
-- i'm on it --
you do business in cuba with your husband?
no.
yes sir.
joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
maude, please. don't die. i couldn't bear it. please, don't die.
i don't think i can get her to do it.
i said you were never a faggot.
ninety-three point four million.
and before that?
where's ian?
if you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
who was he?
we need to find a way to make me part of it.
sure, whatever. maybe i'll catch a movie.
fuck you.
i'm not here for a fuckin' book report. they're your books, why don't you read 'em?
i never do that, you always lie!
they'll find its weakness.
i told him about your work, and he's very excited.
he's a man of god; he's true to his vows.
this is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  come on.
i just meant--
tell me, michael.  what really happened with pentangeli?
umm, i'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
i'd say nothing. after two or three, people will try to find a pattern. a reason.
men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. i will not budge for no man's pleasure, i.
c'mon!  the guy's working with you. you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
bunny lebowski. . . she is the light of my life.  are you surprised at my tears, sir?
levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. i suggest you talk to us.
down, daphne!
is that why you're with him?
can't give you the details because i can't remember.  i went to court to kill him.  at the ezekiel walters hearing.  i was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  you were there. that's the first time i saw you.
well, what do you want me to do, rita -- i can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  well, of course i know <u>you</u> can.  no, rita, i -- what was that?  -- oh, i thought i heard something on the line.
hello, darling.  good evening, mr. carpenter.
what happened, duff?
no.....but i think honza at the office has. you keep shifting this crap and i'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. take a break for lunch and i'll catch you up later.
thirty-two outta what, twenty?
because i am a moral person.
we're old friends.
th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
but...
tina, it's not like that.
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. i think he felt it too.
oh, i would love that, wally.
what about a battered woman's shelter? you can move you kid in with you.
i'm on my way.
it's a lovely outpost.
are you going in?
what are you driving at, boss?
absolutely not. no more than seven percent.
major, that's all i've been told.  just got it on the red phone.  the base is to be sealed tight.  and i mean tight.
like hell!  and who the hell are you to give me orders.  watch your manners or you'll be on your sicilian ass in the street there.
i know it! please believe me, i know that...
sure, auggie. i follow. when you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. i know what that is. it's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
look - denver be here in the day. i be here in the night. i'm a take care of you, you hear? starting now.
i	know what a burrito is.
chief, it's mikkelson.
one false move and i'll blow your heads off!
i see. helmsman?
the young lady staying in your room?
that's even better.
i didn't do anything...god saved her...
where did paul hang out?
i thought you could use it. when you start your band.
my husband believes in you.  we're gonna make it.  bye bye dorothy.
right.
i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri, killer of women and children.
i've studied the case file, have you...? everything you need to find him is right in these pages. whatever his name is.
yeah. i know i did. but...  i'm tryin' to be dif'rent. i'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
this one can.
it's a programmed <u>mechanism</u>, mr. spock...
like you'd know what to do with one.
marylin? forgive me but are you -- drunk?
i'm tired of owing you things. you're free to go. go ahead.
yes, i'd...i-i-i'd love, i'd love to get you this.
what are you doing here?
you followed me!
when this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. take a vacation.
japanese stick-fighting.  they're trained as kids, y'know.  to kill with sticks.
you have one with two beds?
that's it.
oh, yes!  you live near here, don't you?
please, call me alan. we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
the most beautiful woman in the world.
screaming
i mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
he'll be all right.
oh no... it doesn't please me at all...
i hope they didn't go to any trouble, john.
oh!  oh, tin man!   oh!
just like that?
my guess -- vernon hardapple.
we'll leave first thing in the morning.
yeah, actually i do.
why?
oh, hi ...
maelcom... do you think there's a hell for computers?
i told you i'm interested in mythology.  we can talk about it more.
there's no third thing. don't be superstitious.
you could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. he talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
good evening, mademoiselle.
no, i did not.
it wasn't loaded. i didn't put the bullets in it.
thanks.
kiki - he won't hurt you. there's nothing to be afraid of.
hello, stew.
i can make wishes like this come true.  i'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
cameron, what is the matter with you. you act like they're your mother or something.  you afraid of them?
mr. pink.
only what i read in the newspapers.
a doll alone proves nothing. true. but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
i'm for that.
i want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, i'm going to call daddy.
you're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "i'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" if he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. if he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. but if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. then, while he's out...
do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
they'll kill me.
shut up beavis! uh, yeah. we'll do your wife.
dark haired...
hi.....  roses.
i'm sorry, sir, i have no intention of making light of this committee. and i have no intention of incurring your wrath, mr. chairman. i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. they've sent me letters from jail.
i want to talk to you.
...i said that before.
it's none of my business?
what do you mean?  look.  we can make still make it work.
why didn't you say something?
sire, i --
then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  all right?!
because i think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
absolutely nothing.  how is he?
i won't, i swear.
he's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  i mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
no. i'm not busy.
i love you.
i'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
who's she?
sit on it!  <u>now</u> look.
uh...didn't we <u>do</u> this?
they need guidance.
down here, hooper!
flowers.
i was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was o.k. by me.  i introduced him to people--even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. it didn't seem to matter--i didn't care--  --until he roped ned in. some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
thank god this plate was already fixed.
i'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? i mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
see ya.
why do i have to lie in the road?
might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
i love the law. i know the law. i excel at practicing it. it's the only thing i've ever wanted to do.
no.  but this is.  they wouldn't take my blood.
aw-right.  what about the other guy?
speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow moss want?
hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  sharks don't commit murder. they don't pick out a person....
those streets up in the hills, man. gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  those curves don't kid around.
christ!
true, but do you know how many people are going to be there? all of our old classmates, to say the least.
shut up!  you only killed the bride's father - that's all -
i roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "yo trabajo para jimmy herrera."
you can't do this -
all paved with diamonds and gold?
i don't understand?
who?
she needed it.
i like it.  this whole thing is pretty incredible.  i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york.
i thought latisha said you would --
i'll call you then.
kind of liked you as a girl.
what?
thank you, miss johnson.
night, honey.
who's norma?
how do you know?
i won't try to keep up with you. i'm not as fast on my feet as i once was.
de<u>ceased</u>.  i don't know where it came from.
yes. she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
help me in!
jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
marcus brody, sir. and where is indy?
he never stopped.
he's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
it's not a food baby. i took three pregnancy tests today. i am definitely up the spout.
yeah, well...i forgot my morphine back in the room.
that's like a stag film.
we still have pressure. the radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
it was all in czech wasn't it.
nice place you got here.
donna, you are a muffin.
conklin! stuff on conklin! 
you got a great ass!  i love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
i don't need it.
i've got it, elaine!  i've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
did you hear me?
trying to change the past.  he said it was the only way to save the world --
two years...three years...
are you asking me out?
there! you see!
alexander, i know you're trying to help.  but they don't come back.
i wish i could, paul. try to hold out.
the spot we picked to spend the winter. maybe we ought to look a little harder.
no!  no different!  the differences are in your mind.  throw them out! no longer of use are they to you.
i went back to watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  worst day of my life.
not her. you!
i'll leave the plane in the hangar at kufra oasis.  so if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  we might all be back in a month or two.
knox, you are so infuriating!
that's what i love about a small town. you know everybody.
hruphh...?
yes, sir.
wait.
well, i, uh... you didn't...
yeah.  parts of them.  anyway, in purgatory, dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
from? from? from?
... the smell of victory, jeanne! mmmmmmm!  i love it!
the star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. however, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
you've just said you signed it.
you said you'd call my father.
that'll work.  i just bought one for myself.
oh indeed?
how long will it take!
consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. no more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
heathcliff, jackie gleason, and in the role of catherine earnshaw, lucille ball.
and try the president's private number at the hospital.  make sure this is on the level. we're busy people here.
don't talk like that.
but... i am a green man.  i have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
looks that way, son. guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
then how are you supposed to get back?
one that went up for murder -- he was an army sergeant.
well i don't...
what do you think i am doing? hold on. what are you doing? unlock that gate. oi! i said unlock that fucking gate.
in this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
you're firing me.
i'm getting the children out of here. at least until we know what we're dealing with.  john, i want you to come with us.
they're moving apart.
no! don't --  oh, wow.
ah! i thought you were a mailman.
no.  they're just coming to me.
ooh, i've read about this philly. she's the one who gave that wimp batman all those migraines up in gotham...
i'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
believe me, buddy, i was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. bring darien...
he wasn't acting?
you should have told me who you were working for.
a polish pilot. it's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
you'll find her.
no way.
she told me you were a ghost in her life. daddy the friendly ghost.  coming back to haunt her.
in cheyene walk?  lucy's going to have a meltdown.  oh, i'm so sorry.
with you?!  who is 'you'?  did you tell her who you are?
half and a dollar.
for what?
listen, the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her ... i never saw her again.
you wanna go out with him?
why don't i set you down here and we won't argue about it.
lower the boats!
then wait -- count to twenty.
smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
now that i can help you with. nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear. he's a chef. check with palmdale p.d. i'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
don't be so upset. it's ok...
what happened?
just make sure you do it. you know what i mean?
i'm not your wife.
did she make mistakes?
he wasn't abyssinian, pop, assyrian... .
nobody leaves cuervo jones. not unless you give your life. you fight till you're dead. then i forgive you.  understand?  understand?
fine, maybe you're right.  but it doesn't friggin' matter.  i can't afford a star, so i don't even know what we're talking about.
a lot of bad stuff happened here. it's as good a place as any for it to end.
cigarettes, candy bars...  pcp, crack...
what is it -- i can't tell anything --
...for the same reason you miss her. you lived with it so long.
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
i'm going back tomorrow.
i have to go...
he don't, huh?  well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
a funeral.
outside?
yeah --
that's attorney client privilege.  sorry, miles. but as a great and clever man once said, what's good for the goose --
why?
i'm sure there is a way, majesty. some kind of a little contest. i could perhaps put together a small committee, and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty's wishes.
i am afraid so, son. about a week ago. her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
he can wait. let's stay here until morning.
i hate this city.
i don't think that's true.  i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny... and i'd like to know what they are.
what final challenge?
shut up!
you sorta looked like you might need my help.
i'm fine, daddy. when are you coming home?
finish your breakfast...
thanks.
then he's mistaken. you know, i really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
why?
cricket's in the halfpenny place.
oklahoma city.  jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
but functioning.
civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
franz!  help!  lunatic!
i'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
thomas welles.  nice picture.
we'll talk about that, harry. but first i gotta know, how'd you hook up with chili palmer.
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then.  i call him smedley.  his real name is frankie jenkins - but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "frankie!" .. where is this leading to, mr. garrison?
oh...oh...oh, shit!
that's good.
no problem. what's on your mind?
all right -- you don't believe me.
it's why he was killed. jasper lamar crabb. jasper lamar crabb.
sit.
i took the odds on getting down in one piece, and i made it.  now we're in my territory.
yes! the workhouse!
i am delighted to see you, mr. daglish.
he can't be far away.  find him. go!
what?
and where do you think jezebel comes from?
this guy means business.
just from his agent.
decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, mr. baker. it spreads into his chest. then the heart goes. we wouldn't want that, would we?
not who. a data bank. just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
well, all right. but i'm liable to get into a jam.
well, she was a very tempting siren, father. built like you wouldn't believe. so i gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
oh really?
i haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
what if i gave you forty?
you know what i'm talking about. it's all over your face. that i-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! you see, shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. i've sent shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
nothing.  what were you going to say?
...read it over, and think about it.
i don't help criminals.
then it happened before they scuttled her.
shit.
why?
she won't stop crying...
i'll try to be more careful.
doug, this is joe white, and this is, this, this is my fiance, doug mac...
i've got to go see gruber.  what's the best cigars you have?
i'm pulling, damnit!
they're not going to hurt you. they're encased in plastic.
alright?
that's what serafine is searching for. without much luck, i'm afraid. if only we could speak with him. but alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
yeah, i always wanted to watch you eat.
he's pretty tight with his family.
kay--
do more. otherwise, i'll be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
is she responsible for the punch?
hush, baby.
my love is no lie. i have a wife, yes, and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps. it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that. and yet you let me come to your bed.
don't, i'll drink it.
i wasn't talking about anything.
if these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
i want to be had.
i count my blessings.
huh? no, alright. well, you know what we need? a hot cop of coffee. hand on. ohh, hey, i was up all night too, man. a long, long, long night.
that's because your mother is a fine person, finer than i will ever be.  now, just this once...
four different people, inspector. three men and a women.  i've made slides for two.  they handled both envelopes.
i'm a nurse.  i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital.  dr. paley's on staff there.
what?
alexander... i know you.
not yet, but...  hey, there's only a grand here.
no, thank god for you, mr. taransky.  how many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
many have perished in that maze.
don't threaten me, private.
oh, let it ring.
for christ's sake, john!  throw me the keys!
no, you tell her.
i launched skywire. just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary's satellite.
yeah?
page boys!
you're *ticklin' me!*
i'll go with that plan.
what?
i know...i know...if the cash is there we don't care...  finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
has he asked to see the book yet?
what?... maybe... no... i dunno...
no. you can't trust her.
i've got one now.
doing what?
all right enough!  i'm tired of thinking about all this!
that sounds fine.
oh ... i dunno.
i don't remember
we're doing some serious shit here. now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
figured it was something like that.
good luck.
no, i can't wait. you know when i wait? when it's important to wait. it's not important to wait for no steak. it's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it ain't important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
where does it say that?
i have been trying to reach wilfred with no success.  as one grows older, one yearns for family.
because we were good at it?  hell, we were great at it. jesse, don't tell anyone i said this, because everybody knows i'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
no, i ain't got you...
i must have made a mistake.
i'm there, daddy. wheww. i'm cool enough to kill.
vivian, what the --
oh, god!
i think you do, mr. chance. however, i will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  call me if you change your mind about signing.  c'mon, sally - let's grab a bite...
i bet you want your head scratched.
take no offense trevor. i see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
in a building belonging to the university in the old town.
trying to put it off on her?
tell her... we'll get him.
no.  i'd have liked to.
do it, or look for another profession.  that's a choice i guess.
mr. kane, how can i persuade you -
like i'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start.
about sex?
did you look for his passport, driving licence?
what bus?
i already have a boyfriend, nick.
yes.
the handle is heavy.  and the blade is no ordinary metal.  still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. you're just not used to handling it.
german, is that you?
come now, mr. gardiner, before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand, did he not?
yes, sir.
i wish i had the nerve. and the figure.
i could not come.  i had other responsibilities.
ooh, i guess i do know something here's looking at you, kid...
wasn't that ship destroyed?
it's not good, ben - i'm sure you can feel it.
so nice
no need. i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
they hurt... but they don't stop me!
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
i'm doing you folks a favor --
don't be sorry. i've never been happier. i feel like i've been handed a new life.
you did.
is that an offer?
that little prick.
leaving?  for how long?
great.  sit down.  oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
if at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, peerless.
really, mr. clurman, you don't have to sell me.
frequently played, seldom remarked.
"always be closing..."
yes, i think so, it is still barred, but it is not the university who are in the building.
this could be it!
oh mark.  it's ok.  it's ok.
garbage man?
i hear she was a terror to work with.
a baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
hello up there! anyone! can someone call an ambulance? i'm in quite a lot of pain.
we still have the prisoners, sir. perhaps their information --
you've really got a problem.
thanks, lloyd.
why do you think i ask?
that's so good to hear, sweetheart.  it really is. you know, i .. are you alone?
i wasn't sure if you'd make it.
prove it!
i don't know. who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york?
oh my god, i'm a huge skye davidson fan. she's very beautiful.
no sir.
i don't know what that means.
mmm.
when does frederick ever come with her?
if i were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  do you wish to marry me, jack?
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
well, i don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and – and – and who killed nigel grinch-gibbons?
too bad you and i are the only ones.
open your door.
timmy baterman. that was wrong.
it's a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet.
why not? i am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
then there isn't much i can do, is there?
naw, it ain't like that.
i can't -- i won't be able to stop --
totally! look!
i promise. someday. when i'm really supposed to.
thank you.
people more serious about their work. you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
we're not much good at goodbyes, helena.
they're hunting people on the streets. they've picked up henryk.
she's not like mom. she's... i don't know... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.
are you going to graduate school?
guess you must be lookin' after my boy. i'm duff anderson.
i didn't sign up to go home empty handed. and i sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
3jane's the only person beside tessier that knows the code.
that's not my ring.
prince albert was going to build a bench here.  he thought it one of the best views in osborne.
i seem to remember knocking on your door.
she certainly has.
i'm honored, honeythorn gump... but no more tricks.
in his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  she had written him many letters of love.
yes...
no, i didn't know that.
would you talk to her?  she's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  she still blames it for my father's death....
i always go a size smaller.  makes me look slimmer.
that's very simple to answer. they were given to me by my mother. they were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
oh, so that's him? the panda man.
hi, annie, laurie...
used to what?
jack.
mr. vanderhof, in public relations, and mr. eichelberger, in mortgage and loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
okay.
but he'll kill her!
ohhhh i started this, didn't i, didn't i, didn't i, fuck.
goodbye, donald.
then shut up.
no, i don't want to leave now. i'm having too good a time... of course i'm coming!  you'd think you're gonna leave me?
you should've killed her, then.
oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
how do you mean?
i work for patchett.  i had a feeling that there was someone else, but i never knew who.
he is traveling with a lady.
what is it you want?
i am a blank sheet.
the fifty kilos, matthew.  i have to find it.  i can't let it get out on the street.
i'll call you. let you know.
and i don't try to touch her. you know, in a bad way. foolin' around, sex and all.
there's plenty of fruit.
if that's what it says.
oh.  congratulations.
no.
roger.
didya look at the border?
just your imagination.
such a racket i heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
birds are my friends. that sounds egotistical, but they are. birds know i watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
i asked odette to take a look at little anais. she has a rash.
what?
it's deceptively simple.  like a bruckner symphony or a matisse.
what did you do to buzz?
i'm so glad you're safe. you look really wonderful.
of course. aunt joan.
oh.  good.
my __ex__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
baby?  right on time.
the government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. but they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
almost a year.
look over there.  that's the eye in the sky room.
but they did take place?
who is it?
oh, a very naughty boy. someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet.
no sweat, buddy.
the both of you.
careful, remember who's giving you this job.
outta my job, outta seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
thank you.
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
try "old" on for size.
does that mean this whole thing is over?
i don't think it is a duplication.
you're a clown.  you're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
never mind your theories. was she ever conscious?
it's all right, violet.  it's working. all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
and you're gonna die after me, right?
would you please stop calling me that?
god, you're cute when you're mad.
homicide, miss hearn.  it's detective eddie flemming.  open up.
anybody here wanna double their bet?

i've made progress.  i'm in manhattan.  once a few more pieces fall into place, i'll drive to you and give you an update.

you almost knocked me down.  the word is "excuse me."
to joseph bonaparte -- dear joseph, i have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  i am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money i left with you expressly for this purpose.  must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the bonaparte family?
please be a little more careful how you talk, mr. mitchell.
must've been a cheap date.
i can whip your ass.
my master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the english squatters. they have consented to go. so now he calls them enemies no longer.
i don't know, sir. i don't follow political issues much.
yes, i feel their spirits. cora... keaton... i am here to communicate...

i don't know.
i'll be okay.
i teach english at addley high school in addley, pennsylvania.

i always thought the french came here to get the rubber.
i don't know.

the brakes are shot.

i'm sure you should have failed.
so long, father.

me neither. how 'bout you carrie?
my experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise, this crew...
how much we got left in that minigun?
yeah?
"dracula."
we must be a curious sight to him.
hey, i can take a hint. you look great today.
only one thing can save the children. the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  it is an abomination to god and man.
i married into it.
i was expecting you. come in.
okay, i'll give here the message.
i want to make you happy, toto! i'm going to tell you a story.  once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! and he immediately fell in love with her. but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...one day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end i'll be yours.' christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! one day, two days, ten, twenty...every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. come rain, wind, snow, never budged! the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. he didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. the princess kept watch...and on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
maybe older --
not a thing.
found what?
not from forty feet.
what's this about?
she's very pretty, your mother.
can't it wait till morning?
hullooo!
somewhere safe.
no.
chancellor.
i'm not sure. i haven't seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival.
...it's definitely on.
yes.
dignan, it's --
where is she now?
suzie --
well, then, i know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... but by that time she's liable to be in china...
it isn't me!
you’re not going to get away with this.
you are half human. the computer knows that.
that's the way it came out.  let me ask you one question.  have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
college. haven't really thought about it.
oh, that'll be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.  'lo, earl. how are you feeling?
'bye, son -- i won't be gone long.
what else?
i don't know.
she made a play for me after i got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. every time we got into a clinch, i'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. an eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. the minute i started thinking about it, mr. johnson would get all soft and small. and i can't see getting married if mr. johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
well. is it long?? i'm going out, but --
i thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
well, i don't like to see you mope.
people can be kinder than you think.
you're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  it's at the grand central.
his kid's sick.
he ain't the problem, jack.
do you have a phone?
i hope i didn't hear that.
well - well we haven't quite received my father's consent, your majesty. not entirely. not altogether.
am i in charge of this thing?  or not.
you better start.
the driveway's on my side of the house.
and you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this hat, and...
sounds respectable.
soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
i can arrange that. i like that.
splendid! i love a good game of name that nightie.
come in.
it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
roger. one-three-eight.
there's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. that's the beauty of it all. simplicity. besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
you tell me.
i have this thing where i have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, i can feel completely free to be myself.
no.
no....i though  i'm afraid.
-- no, no, no, don't even.  i talked to laura, rob.  i talked to her and she gave me a little background. and you're a fucking asshole.
they've got my amado.
you're lying...!
oh! so, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
oh, hi.  hi, rob.
well, sir, like i said, for the same reasons we do.  i mean, all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
i'm begging you.  get on the bus. get on the bus.
really? i'm the only person i know that likes danny ainge, outside of celtic fans. maybe phoenix.
alight, alright.  stay calm.  you opened this door.  there's got to be a way that you can close it.
you didn't visit him in prison.
forget it, sugar, will you?  forget about saxophone players.  you're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
never... never... never!
ooooh.
ta.  ta.
you want a beer, ang'?
the last time i took orders from you i ended up with five years probation.
you got it! see you later honey.
hank! he said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. so i went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... i felt so sorry for him --
what?
i'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but i'm not lying to you.
no.
some other time, cobb. some other time.
yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. i won't be a minute...
but you're dog enough. maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
yes.
don't need water.  we didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today. don't you agree?
yeah, they are but...
a useless talent.
claude.
you're insane or you think i am.
i've got be here for the police when they come.  then i've got to practise. in case you forgot i'm in the middle of a match right now.
everybody's good-looking, patrick.
there's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
can i get a word in edgewise?
it's nothing.  it doesn't hurt.
excellent. my friend and i are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a syrah.
by killing them?
that was the telephone.
i said that's enough!
how?
[daniel rosas sanchez.]
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the world almanac!
then i gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
he said it'd be doing him a big favour.
and i don't believe you...
your dad?!
well, you could say that murder was part...
yeah. he'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
just a guess.  but i think found a nest.
did you see it?
i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, mom.  get out of my room.
yes, i suppose that we did.
is sex the only thing that matters to you?
who?
certainly not.  so what's that got to do with it?  mr. kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
this nigger's breaking up my place, sheriff langston.
of course, that's what they're for.
i thought you said no more aches and pains?
no.  we want ...
are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. you just sign these papers and i'll give you ten dollars apiece.
you don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  i've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks i'm going to stop smoking...  i changed the subject, didn't i?  dear, dear!  what a disagreeable old man i've become.  you want to know what i think of charlie kane?  well - i suppose he has some private sort of greatness. but he kept it to himself.  he never - gave himself away -  he never gave anything away.  he just - left you a tip.  he had a generous mind.  i don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  that was because he had the power to express them, and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  but he didn't believe in anything except charlie kane.  he never had a conviction in his life.  i guess he died without one -  that must have been pretty unpleasant.  of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  but we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  you're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
please.
i signed-up for the stock option.
yes -
i don't.  but the language he's speaking is universal.
and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
sure.
we do.  she's got hers, we've got ours. hey. wash and dries.
i... i was playing with fire.
what do you want me to say, gwen?... they wanted the commander.
ah.
yes, eve. i shall yield too.
yeah.
yeah, i'm religious.  i'm not an atheist like you!  now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
jesus.  i do not know.  i'll talk to you later.
when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
how did it go at the bank?
in progress, admiral.
stop it!
you're gettin' the car.
-- we're going to be here all night.
yes.
what did you think would happen?
er, well, twelve.
fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
how is gregor?
wilmont. near the high school.
you seemed interesting.
sally ann cavanaugh. oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
happy?
yeah, yeah.  good thing.
i'm sorry, really i am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
in that case, i permit you.
how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
au revoir.
their bases are very well hidden. all the power of the empire can't find them... do you know where they are?
all right, i'm on fire!  black seven, seven stickin' spades. let's go!
i'm not really sure. i think it's irish. or maybe --
i'm not going...
yeah.
my lover and i.
are you crazy?
what?
huh?
you have a request?
all i'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
salzburg.  we were just talking about salzburg.  if you've come from my friend the fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. because i've got good news for him. i'm done with vienna. it's over, finished, done with! done with! done with!
usual bullshit.  you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... you know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. especially compared to this.
richard was in the army. i met him while i was living in naples. i didn't know where iowa was. i only cared that it was america. and of course, being with richard.
huh?
yes. of course..
all right.  i'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
skeptical about what?
why?
...rene...
hmm. i'd say eight, maybe nine.
no, of course, captain, i can understand your concern.
oh, then you did hear from him?
no. i didn't run away. i went out of town.
man.  i'm sorry.  old man, what knight live in that castle over there?
everything is a-okay, but i've gotta get that sandwich!
that's what she told you. i looked it up at the hall of records. your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
correction. this spunky monkey on my right is terry macey. and we are your minnesota american teen princess state board.
yes yes... of course.... the "blacksmith's code"...
that's what i'm talking about.
look mr denham - you're not welcome here. just pack up your cameras and go.
i told you we had plenty to talk about. shall we sit down?
what the hell are you talking about?
otherwise i'll call the police
then who wrote the report?
damn, jackie, i was just playin' with you.
and the ten thousand?
i'm crash override.
ain't gonna happen.  we've got unequal pupilation.  he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
jeff. you know, i was talking to mister brooks yesterday. he has this friend in new york who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. i could swing that. six-fifty.
what's wrong?
you're a celebrity, john.  people are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
what give you that idea. i seen one of the cats heard it.
of course, my dear.
she is much younger than i am. that's something i'm going to have to get used to. isn't it, larry? they'll all be much younger than i am. here.  tear them up.
must it be so definite? can't we just say that we will be married when i get back?
i can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
the <u>ninth</u>?
yes... yes, let's go in.
how many?
how's that, quince?
he said he wasn't coming back. he said it wasn't working for him any more. that it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... you know what i regret the most? i'm sorry i let him make the kids take his name. he was an acquirer.  he liked to acquire things.
that's right, mr. stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. i'd like your signature here -- see. and when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  it's our usual form. of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
if you want me to go, i will.  do you want me to leave?
jerses -- tomorrow...
i don't know.  excessive masturbation?
so i don't know about horror.
yeah, i'm sorry, i was just looking for the principal's office.
what about you?  you haven't eaten in days.  how come you're never on this side of the microscope?
playfully shoves his hand away.
no. it's not don.
i don't know. he was sick. he wanted out. i believed him.
i think i'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
that's right.  you're not.
i got it in the inaugural.  "thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
yes.
get lost bobby.
maude.
again
but i don't need an uncle, sidney.
naw--not much!
on screen.
knowledge.
i had to tell someone. he put it into perspective.
thank you.  this is burgess.
about what? your marriage to anne!
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago.
it's miller time.  let me go give these koreans s'more business.
i haven't killed _you_.
you like being a hooker, vivian?
for who, mr. findley? ...bert, he only beat me by one point. now, you can't get off me now.
sense of humour went with the memory, huh? you know why you're still here, don't you?
<u>fuck</u> them!  now get your head in the game, phil--we have to handle this.
pacifica, california.
or the sexual habits of locusts?
this is not your house, doyle. this is my house and i'll say who stays and goes. you've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
eh, yes, ma'm.
don't you remember what they called you?
yes.
with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
look, that's temporary, believe me. there's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won't matter a bit.
none!  the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  he's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the cia.
if i could accept the offer right now, i would.  they took it back.
i was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
i don't even know what i'm looking for.
'course, you could be right. your sons are alive. all my sons are dead.
funny you should mention it. that's what your father and i been talkin' about.
no. no.
no need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
yeah... yeah... now i can hear it.
tell me something, clayton.  do you believe in mercy killing?
what happened to it?
wow, kev...it's perfect.
gale?
you're talking to me?
i'm fine.
deals?  my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. you'd have to be more specific.
i insist.  there clearly isn't room for us all, i'm the least able to dig, and i'm not one of the walking wounded. those are facts.  besides, if i remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. it's hard to argue with this logic.
says here one of our boys brought him down.  you ever heard of a badge named wade?
do you know that house?
i'm glad. hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you've been asking yourself. now, we're gonna have a little q and a, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  want a chesterfield?
a piñata. that's a <u>great</u> idea!
it doesn't work on small animals!
stu... it's a <u>party</u>.
if you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
thank you
general lee, sir!
what in sugar hill's the matter with him?
what am i going to to do with this guy?  pierce, i was just on the phone with borough command. out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
yah, i'm down in the twin cities and i was just watching on tv about these shootings up in brainerd, and i saw you on the news there.
yeah. yeah, not bad. how's your's?
dorie miller, 'mam.
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write? i knew your name was familiar. i just didn't know why.
of course, nick...
shut up, starling...
i see your point. what's the favor?
stand up, mister, or i'll beat you where you sit.
the kid's got talent. you've never seen malkovich like this. schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. impressions.
that's what i said.  is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
later.
what do they want?
what kind of bomb was it?
no, i don't. i'm alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.
you're the worst of that sort. you're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
where're you?
butterflies, my ass.  i'm about to go home.
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  just like beauregard.  one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
i am, too.
jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
elbow.
replacement party.
what's that?
yeah.
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city.
what do you mean?
monsieur rick, may i get you a cup of coffee?
yeah?
and it's over...?
well, now you have.
sure. see ya.
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
we got the 411 on your good old boy.
just looking for you, o'connell! i wanted to be with my friend!
i'm gonna hate it.
if not for data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
it's our goddamn car!
who's going to raid a funeral?
here i am.
no way to know. without more tests, experiments.
do you have the musical, "annie"?
all right, miles. let me tell you everything you think you know. i was married to rex for a long time. i was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together. i got five years older. think he should be able to ditch me for that?
i have to ask you that. if you were vice you couldn't deny it. you ought to dress less square. you wouldn't get hassled so much. here, let me help you get that tie off.
sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
what happened?
you haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
no!
in the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  when they're having sex.
nothing.
i'm sorry, this is too good!
they didn't have to do a thing, that's all i'm saying. the team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. but then they had to screw it up.  they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  a mess of porridge.
i recognize you only as my son, no more.
that's nice.
nothing—
well, for the baby, really.
well, i'm-i'm looking for a bookstore.
no, i'm divorced.
why you want to do that, to a frien'?
well, let's see now... if it has my name on it, then i guess it's mine.
it's not. i can't take it.
you were hugh sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for stans immediately after sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
but really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
you're doing just fine.
well, ned, you'll want to tell me an' mister beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, i guess.  bring him in, boys, for i will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
when they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
that's cool. well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
tomorrow, then.
what is this?  that's my money. you tryin' to muscle me?
you're staying at the hotel?
may i have a sandwich, please?
i dunno... would i have to take classes and stuff?
i thought we'd lost you.
you still haven't answered my question.
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
where you going?
you found my treasure? why didn't you tell me.
not for me- i'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  take the others to the water tower for the night.
sing! sing and your spirit will soar!
yeah, it's terrible.  i mean valli, and i don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  he probably had it coming, but all the other people.  real sad.
so, what are you looking for?
look, i got this kid.  we got a goddamn relationship!  i'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  he worships me.  if i go down what's this do to my son?  i'm his goddamn role model for christ sake!
i'm so excited, icarus.
wait a minute... what are you saying?
i thought you had your own business. you said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
he had a yacht?
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
ben where do you have to get to?
now she tells me.
mother... go away!
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died. they also said their children were taken from them.
dad... it's the treatment. more retching.
or what?
oooooweee!!  you shoulda seen me! like i'd been doin' it all my life! nobody would ever believe it.
sure.
all right.  i'll show you something sacred.
you quitter you quitter you quitter.
i looked for you, angie, before i cut out, but i couldn't find you.
i've offended you!
i'm just setting my boundaries.
to what?
thanks for coming.
something modest but clean -- and near enough to unesco so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
that's probably not a good idea. your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
good.  you wanna tell me what happened?
and you were the last one to talk to him.
would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
he couldn't break an egg with a hammer. he still writing those crime porn books?
for like, twelve zillion eternities?
the um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. if that's all...
i don't know that ellie.  he might get out.  garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
screwball!  you dolt!  i've a mind to change you into a toad.
that's more like it.  two more nitrate-sicles please.
you walked?
yeah -- see the fight last night? apollo creed beat that english guy bad.
yeah. what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? six scoop interviews!
we need to talk --
i gotta tell ya...
yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as i do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
yes.
no problem.
kelly van ryan...
i'm definitely traveling some day.
i don't get it!
i don't see any people names.  it's all businesses.
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety.
aha?
well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
so you do know her.
i didn't create this world of ours! i only record it!
a hunting accident. jack and twombley.
or we could do that.
you shot her twice?
can you believe how perfect it fits?
i didn't see you.
i think i should talk to my agent, marty, you and i should, we should, really not discuss...
so you're the new meat?
-- he'll never know the difference.
don't lay any guilt on me. suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
you're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
to the manner born.
no! no. heh. i'll be right back.
that's the way he is.
am i becoming repetitious?
sonny, your wife's on the way ... we reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
yes.
i don't know. are you in, anthony?
who?
he's been expecting you.
i've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  it's just a hunk of peasant iron.  why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
wait a minute --
she's left before...
said he was gonna stay a week.
this is... really a shock...
she's wearing a ring.
but i want to know what you think.
i knew about it. big dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
you look all right. you want to pick it up a little?
huh?
well, no.
what?
it's not fair!
i've been reading up on it.
finally!?  it's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  more ale, here!
emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
the police always do, don't they?
i never knew a girl that could play.
if we make a mistake., he'll burn us. you make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
not at all, if it can help.
you really don't remember anything that happened?
no!  there's an adult bookstore back there!  i'll be right back!
point, lupus. give us a point.
i didn't sell it.
i took the road less traveled, adelle.
hong kong.
hey, i read the papers, i watch 60 minutes, i say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. they want something.  now, personally, i don't care about your politics. maybe you're pissed at the camel jockeys, maybe it's the hebes, northern ireland, that's none of my business.  i figure, you're here to negotiate, am i right?
what do you mean?
at what, exactly?
i want you inside me right now.
you know, you're a good kid.
well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
you go, boy.
morning, max.  bummer about the store.  you insured?
maybe. i don't know. he has not asked my advice. if he asks my advice, i don't know what i will say.
of course it was.  anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  you try flogging the stories on cnn i've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  at any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  miss hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus.  not even antibodies.
a joke is a story with a humorous climax.
mother and -- ? you knew your mother and father?
peter, this is serious.  i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
fine. get started. and a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  and i'm sorry for my tone earlier. but i repeat- there is no reason for fear. i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge.
why do you have to rush off? what's so important in san francisco?
you look a little green.
mmm.
what? that was the best part of the old game.
is chase porter your husband?
about where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
what kind of car do you have, harold?
i had to get away!  my life was in danger!
there's a lovely inn just down --
oh, i'm sure it will!
come, come, mozart; i'm interested. truly.
the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
pancakes.
that frank was working on. yeah. he thought franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. so franky finds out. he comes to me in tears. he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. i told him 'franky, wake up. these people are sharks. what do you think they got so rich from? doing good?' he can't be comforted. he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the judge to rat them out.
yes, me!
how could i miss it? the tv won't quit with that stuff.
uhhh...i am sooo tired...i stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
look, i'm going back to my house to ponder this. so stay calm and keep track of schwartz's comings and goings. oh, and somebody dispose of schwartz's wife, will you?  nice to meet you all.
how's the rest of the gang? you seen anyone?
not on the map.  looks like it connects with the city sewer.
we'll see about that. i'm sheriff john langston. as you may have guessed, i am not from these parts.
the most. you ever lost. on a coin toss.
i've seen them all before.
why have i come to a church? i never have before. i guess i just... felt i should.
abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
so now - a minor. suddenly.
no, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  okay, let's get a move on!  when are you leaving?
we'll take it.
hildy -- i can't. i'm busy -- i -- let me up, hildy. earl williams has escaped --
i think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- i want to keep things on a professional level.
i don't want to hear it.
very good, chief. chief guard turns to alex.
you'd think he'd had practice.
so if i needed a doctor, you could be it?
why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
finish, please!
couple. want to help?
well, at least i'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. that's the first smile i've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? it isn't. oh no. oh dear. oh now i've gone and done it.
a boy?
yes, if you can get him free.
i was just asking. why are you always at me?
yeah.
didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
nope.  there was some talk; it never panned.
it's richard ripley.
but different.
we were friends. i trusted him. i should have known it was weird. but, then again i was weird.
...the guy's great.
i told you when we met i never wanted children.  i don't want kids in my life. we talked about it.  you weren't listening.
then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
yeah, i guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
you don't understand.  the man i'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
i'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
you weren't even alive!
you know it wasn't a joke, theo.
please.
well, what should we do?
like ten after.
your mother thought he was a good man.  he worked very hard.  what i remember most was his manner was so... slight.  it was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
help your mother find the bullet.
do they know who did it?
and what did he come back now for?
no idea who. no idea why ...
like shit.
i mean hardly any thigh.  i'm telling you, joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
look at me! my dress is ruined. i look like shit.
sure.
i don't know.  i'm happy.
mrs. christian.
what do you mean?
what do i always tell you guys? don't spend it all. sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. save some. put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. that's it. the gig's up.
but what can you do? there's no way now . . .
why have you come to my planet?
it is, doolittle, it's the phoenix! they glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
i have the coordinates of the reactor...
gladly caesar.
to rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  a little hypocrisy goes a long way.
sure, boss.
oh, you're changing your mind --
i met the p.b.r. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for phillips, the chief -- gunner's mate third class l. johnson -- lance johnson; gunner's mate third class j. hicks -- the chef -- radio operator second class t. miller; they called him mr. clean.
why?
so there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
listen, toby, i can't really talk right now. do you mind if i call you back?
hi, mom.
i guess...some of them are probably faking.
yeah -- i hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  i'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  i mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
can i trust you, sami?
it's not over yet.
wendigo?
ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
do you want the truth, anya?
cunt.
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of hy-brasil will sink beneath the waves.
do you know where they are?
coming.
you will return to paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to general le clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to madame bonaparte.
seven years.  one baptism?  he's your mother's only brother
that?  i hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
a sin against <i>what?</i>
well -- do you want to go up first?
then what's the problem?
well i hope the carpet matches the drapes.
home, i'm done.
you're here because you figured i might show up.
your aliens, agent mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age. in the form of an evolved pathogen. waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. using us as hosts. against this we have no defense. nothing but a weak vaccine.  do you see why it was kept secret? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
dmitri hired him!  he's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  he was stalking you when i dropped you off.  i don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
this is brock lovett. what can i do for you, mrs...?
i knew you'd come.
what the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? claire's in a weird mood too.
i told the guy---  i told the guy, this isn't even my order.
what!? so you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? no way! that's my god damn truck!
i think ming is older than tong.  what is this?
read 'em!
he no longer works for me.  find susan's killer, mr. white. i'll give you a handsome reward. <u>whatever you desire</u>.
made you say it!
no.  no way.  i can't do this.
it isn't?
that's good... that's wonderful. it's wonderful for you.
you don't think i put something in it, do you?
i don't have all the pieces yet, but i'm close. i'll know tomorrow.
i think so.
now i'll have to borrow your key.
how many weeks?
oh, no!
you going to turn state's?
give me the gun.
it was a great show, dad...
"liebestraum."
you don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
they did show up.  isn't that great?
really?
i always have both.
we know. but ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
i swear on my life, i won't...
is this a catholic guilt thing...?
right! summon the musicians! we'll do the one that goes "tum-tum-tum- tum-ti-tum-tum"
thanks.
only around humans.
what do you think the devil is going to look like if he's around?  nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  no.  i'm semi-serious here.  he will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great god-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. just coax along flash over substance... just a tiny bit.  and he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  and he'll get all the great women.
yeah?
-- yeah, this is --
ronald? that's crazy.
it could be, if you fixed it up. how did you... ? i mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
sdece, service de documentation exterieure et de contre-espionnage. agent phillip raymond.
no!!!
that goddamned woman. thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this. i'm more than pissed, margie. i'm a whole lot more than pissed. i been that plenty and i know the difference. this is different.
you had one you'd know it.  patel. they keep coming up.  i don't know. they like to talk to salesmen.  they're lonely, something.  they like to feel superior, i don't know.  never bought a fucking thing. you're sitting down "the rio rancho this, the blah blah blah," "the mountain view--" "oh yes.  my brother told me that..." they got a grapevine.  fuckin' indians, george. not my cup of tea.  speaking of which i want to tell you something:  i never got a cup of tea with them. you see them in the restaurants.  a supercilious race.  what is this look on their face all the time?  i don't know.  i don't know.  their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, i don't know.  i don't know.  i don't like it. christ...
claire--
doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
i'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  i am dealing with it.
usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
this is deputy chief robinson.  who is this?
cool.
yeah.  i'll do that.  as long as you're not patronizing me.
you wouldn't be putting me out.
thanks.
i didn't just fuck myself! jesus, i'm going to be sick!
look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe vada's trying to tell us something too.
what answer were you--
i feel so bad for her. i mean, she's in jail! and she's innocent. but i'm the only one who believes her. donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
nothing.  absolutely nothing-
you're kidding.
a bullet to the right cerebellum.
. yeah!
you must believe me.
how about you? all right?
and that appears to have been destroyed. it also contained the anti-virus, bellerophon.
let me go first; you stay behind me.
no tax shelters.  no funding.  i want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  the diedre mayfair research clinic.  i'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
seven.  really.
this...is not going to work out.
no?  why's that?
what?  i improved her a little...
don't get kinky here...
herb. <u>i have to go</u>.
look. talk. not talk.
and his track record, that don't count? look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
i've got friends.
so what. infatuation is good, too.
i mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
thanks. i'll tell mike.  well, it's still just a beginning. i know i can...dig deeper.
goddamit...
praxis?
that doesn't mean a damn thing. they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill. but he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
go to the funeral?
oh yes -- i am -- want to bet?
i'm afraid i can't just leave it at that. the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. as ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
lauren's not my wife.
i'm fine.  i'd just rather keep it on.
get rid of it.
no ... they won't be able to tell.
don't be a fembot. so, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
ben--
but he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  i mean--
because that's what it is.
and that's where you introduce me to the governor.
oh, don't get officious. you're not yourself when you're officious. that's the curse of a government job.
that's what i thought.
he requested a combat assignment. there's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. i had no choice but to let him go... he said you'd understand.
it satisfied me.
we'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
the cards. the last thing i said to you was mind the cards.
apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
see them two big trees across there?
he's the best dog in the world.  they're both coming tonight.  not my idea.
george?
was it a boy or a girl?
thanks for the invitation, but i have my own apartment.
are you french?
moreover...
sorry, sir. the cult is my life and my life is the cult. by god, captain god, i shall not fail you..
i was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake. besides yourself.
yes. i did.
stay here! don't stop working!
thanks, no. i despise any form of exercise.  don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
now don't get sassy, ma.
you think that caused the accident, risa?  that it brought bad luck? christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  or maybe they're the same thing.
can the kid walk?
yeah.
so everyone beware who's crooked or unfair; no one must take a bit of graft unless he gets his share. 
curly bill, huh?  who was that other idiot?
 my two friends have my share of the money.  i'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
what? who?
pay him.  pay him what he wants.
make time, okay?  you're the one who told me to act normal.  i've missed three practices already.  if i'm not there for the barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  you realize what would happen if this fort fell?  the whole hudson would be open to them!
you weren't at harrison's department store the night before--
now, hildy, don't be hasty! i can't let him out.
do you want to go or not?  i'm offering you a way out of here.
what the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
there's nothing to hear -- i haven't done anything.  and why haven't i done anything?  because none of you will listen to me!!
so do as i tell you. keep that tron program out of the system. and get me those chinese language program i asked for.
have to, old timer. just for a while.
i know who you are.
thanks, but you have a good time.
but you did have a salvation army- thing going.
yes.
you can't open it yet. you have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
it's under control.
you're nobody. you have no identity.
- michael, his driver's an aussie, new to me.  then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
don't like 'em.  a fan will do.
either you are with me or against me.
gary?
wait.
what's the problem?
uh... oh, thank you.  it's nothing.
what?
it will be more than that, i can promise you.
what was that?
i hate him so much sometimes, stephen. you don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
cheer up, man.  half this money is ours. we're fucking rich.
i will see you at suppertime, rose.
just once, if they take your plane away.
well, i did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my masters degree.
sure. you could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
great.  you get the girl, i get the coroner.
yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  is your lady beautiful? since i came to visit from the country, i have not seen her close. tell me, is she beautiful?
so whatdya say? i'll get the check, and i'll call you in eight months.
you can save that and tell it to the police.  they'll be here in a minute.
after all, this is a conservative firm -- i don't want people to think i'm an entertainer --
you don't want my autograph.
sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- dead man! dead man walking!!
walter, you fucking asshole, we gotta go to pasadena!  come  pick me up or i'm off the fucking bowling team!
hey geraldine, let's eat!
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
get the hose!  we've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
i'll go search for it.
what?
what's that divided four ways?
not tonight. honest.
you can't stay here. there's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
lay off, can't you?
code, i've heard a lot about this.
i can't.
i'm sure you've examined my record. so you know i've never yet been late on a bridge.
let's just say i'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
baby names?
well, i’d sooner mug an old lady...
i know. i spoke to my friend magda.
phones went down a few minutes ago.
it was the only way i could get the movie made!
that's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  i can't control it, sal - let'em say what they want.  forget it.  it don't matter.
because, i'm in the middle of a boating accident, i got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a chief deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   he's another one.
george...
why are you speaking?
a raptor claw. i use to have one. a fossil.
you don't sound too enthusiastic.
what is it with women and catwoman? men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. don't get me wrong--this catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. it's just, i like her a lot.
i'm ready.
okay, everybody, listen up!
which means they're significant.  incriminating.  perhaps, criminal.  she's hiding her past.  she's hiding her past.
if i don't cooperate?
zira doesn't want your female.
'cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
we've got to get an abortion?
are you taking them still?
it's the greatest excitement in the world.
not a holocaust --
thanks, stan. i owe you.
and whose houses do you design...?
does drew tell you everything?
you know.
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69, okay? i'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, i can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  he offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, i...
he told me my share was twenty-five.
to you, to me it's thursday.
i'm shocked.
we'll worry about that later.  now come on, tell me that you're special.
in all that smoke and fire, john had a moment of weakness.  he'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  it was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. i'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
i don't know. i had no food or water. it was very cold. i thought - if i can even save just one... but he got so heavy. so heavy...
i was on a roll!  i’m a little overextended now.
an expired community college student id card.  what did you used to study, raymond k. hessel?
be it fit for your wife, green jack?
hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
your next water ain't for three days.
yes.
okay.  if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  that you don't have... oh christ, sally.
that's wonderful, miss van deusen...what's it about?
what is it... the secret?
sorry, honey...  i'll be right there.
i told you she wasn't attractive...
aye, sir --
he ain't shootin' our way no more.  he's shootin' over that way. who's he shootin' at over that way?
yes! but "love" isn't the operative word here, peace is!
caesar, this is crazy.
bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and i'll knock you into the middle of next week.
yes, sir.
at paul and miranda's.  paul from work.
it feels fine now, jabez.
well, a very real expectation is the british will hang you!  they'll burn mount vernon and they'll hang you!  our marriage is a business just as surely as...
i couldn't believe it! i didn't think she was going to die. i knew she was sick...
look, i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
yes, well, from the department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
how is that possible? you give concerts, don't you? i hear they are quite successful.
no, silly. forget it. i'll make them. thanks.
yeah, i can see that. later i want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
quake knocked you off your feet.  you got bumped pretty good, actually. 
did you hear what i said? the treasure! like on your map!
there's no way out for you.  you have to deal with us.
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
some kind of signaling.
i am a suicide risk.
harry, son.  harry.
in other words, all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
split it up. any word on donny?
is it--?
reckon what kind of a feelin'?
yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
creature of the night.
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
check him out, ray.
and you still believe he's going to come here?
that's helms.  he's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
call me again soon? i'll be waitin' by the phone.
you and mr. sholes seem to be implying as much.
i'm sorry.
frankly - yes.
about what?
what?
in used currency.  nothing bigger than a fifty.
thanks, mary. you can bring her in.
what?!
thought you hated sidnaw.
you're not making sense.
is he cool or angry?
if i tell you, how do i know you won't just club me and take it back?
nothin'. not a goddamn thing. what the fuck...
i don't really follow baseball anymore.
what's your cut?  how much?
i definitely won't.
you will forgive my curiosity, mr. blaine. the point is, an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
thanks for holding on.
i'll leave then, i'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. can i ask you a serious question:
now i think i have upset you. my english perhaps is coarse.
what are you trying to say?  just because i dress well and like to dance --
i don't hear anything.
oh no.
just a thought.
what you say is, "pass the fucking catsup."
willie!
your honor, i'm trying to establish a pattern in dr. paley's behavior with women.
you were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
but my mother says i mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
the job's real. -- but the agency set it up.
i--i don't know. i--i'm afraid they've got me licked.
he hates me.
do you want me to go...?
he has never gotten rid of the malaria. he is usually up and at it the next day. i'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
yeah.
said "looks clear."
- you got to be blonde -
how you feelin'? ok? you feelin' good?
like what, mr. taylor?
it's all right, finn.
fuck it.
look, i'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
come on, letty.   it'll get done.
you don't need a car you can't drive for a month. go see marvin.
they'll love it.
whatever was on that bridge wasn't weir.
is it now?
yeah... i came to save you.  if you're hopeless, i'll pull the plug.
you won't do that.
what?... miss me?  charley, i'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
that's right. we work well together.
i can't describe it. i think it's from the loam in the soil. this very rich, earthy kind of... alive... no. no, that's not right. can you smell it?
i don't want to be reminded of what happened.
okay mr. sultenfuss, you got a deal.
see... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
and you're going to educate them? tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at m.i.t. to become a cable repairman?
31 people.
you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your dad's?
i'm sorry!  i said something wrong, didn't i!  please forgive me!
there must be some way to get it up there.
bela died.
sweet deal.
they're pretending it's process. bullshit, it's foregone.
but more laughter than tears, i think? yes. on balance? i mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. don't we, juliet?
will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
yes.
we must be in the florida keys .				* .  .  the overseas highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
i understand.
nothing.
your first question should be who isn't. it isn't a spark, brian. not enough damage. and an insurance pro? where's the profit margin?
it's one of jack's favorites.
if it is an alien spacecraft --
oh sure, let's string along poor walter, see how far it will take us!
that's why you're a gambling man.
look at that right eye.
i know you will.
mr. campbell?
where in the hell can she be.
what was i trying to say? oh, yes, i think, we think, or at least i suppose we think -- am i right?
maybe you could talk to death!
without any further ado, mickey and mallory...
now who'd go and do...
what wouldja say if i toldja i ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
of course.
for what they done? skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
i'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
oh... thanks.
ya puttin' me on?
you wanted smaller.
you're talking like boris karloff! it's movie dialogue!
what do you mean?
loonytunes.  and yet...
and then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
who do you think you are?
it's just us now.
you're right, you're right, superman. there were wrinkles to iron out. but, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the xk 101.
there's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
ha ha! yeah right, white boy! ha ha ha.  i think maybe i drank too much.
thank you.
might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would i be?
an empty tomb?
well -- here's how it is ...tom sharp, eli higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. what you think about it?
if i hadn't seen you fight with li mu bai, i'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
please, have a seat.
i don't understand --
oh, i found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
oh, yeah.  very.
i know you think that.
me neither.
but...
do me? do me like this, you mean? like chainin' me up?
that won't be necessary.  sooner or later i knew you'd crack this thing, max.  you got me.
it's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
i like the noise.
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
i used to be an actress.
what about sailing?
next week.  this is a mere garden party -- and i wish to join it, so i will be brief.  i am experiencing resistance from the jesuits.
and what do you believe?
oh i like her a lot.
yeah?
no, give me my damn money back.  right now, and i don't have no damn receipt neither.
in the war.  europe, i believe. they could hardly send him to the pacific, could they?
mommy lets me....
not classic, no.
one cannot love and kill.
dennis?  i want you to release those people.
i'm byron. nice to meet you.  c'mon. let's go get your luggage.
yeah, give me a minute.
let's go look, then. let's go look, then!
what are what?
you didn't try hard enough.
how many you say?
-- he's gettin' good on those eggs. and y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
of course -- i don't have friends. that's because i can't walk.  i try to make myself used to it.
it's one in the afternoon.
sure.  that's one of my numbers.  it's how many months old my little girl is.
try speaking to me?
alright -- i'm going to allow his testimony.
well, it bothered me somewhat. and i got quiet.  and now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  and i decide i'm not going to propose.  the mood is not right. why be impulsive? now at this point i know she knows that i was going to propose and didn't.  and she knows i know.  so the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. and we're both good at that.  we fly to honolulu in silence.  we check into the pro bowl hotel --
can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
ah, i had a tough day. some jerk d.k'd me and i gotta cover his loss.
long trip.  pretty nice of you to come.
drugs??!
do anything exciting?
i don't think so.
gear?
no, let me go.
massachussettans aren't.
i told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
what's your name?
i was hoping i might be your friend.
and she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in god...  ... and aren't any worse off than you mother. people who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. and people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. she has a right to know that. but you and your... your order and your church have kept her ignorant...
can we just talk this out?
can i sit down?
of course...it's wonderful.
i hear you.
get a tricorder. you're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
those wimps.  it's because i use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  i told you to move those crates an hour ago.  come on guys, let's get going.
most official records were lost in the war.  the computer knew almost nothing about connor's mother.  her name. where she lived, just the city. no scanner pictures.  the terminator was just being systematic.
hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
give me an address so i can send your shirt back.
you wanna go right now?
they caught him in the closet with a girlscout.  side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  you have to keep'em guessing for  two weeks.  you  don't have to cure cancer, pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
sure, pop. whatever you want.
i, uh, don't really know any.  we - -
she's okay.
i didn't want to see you. i mean, i did...but i didn't..
i can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  jesus, kate, i could’ve been a thousand times the man i became.  how could you do this to me?  how could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
he went home sick.
yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world.  ooh, hey, i gotta run.
i tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  now stop this pussyfooting around.  dead kids!  how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this?  i mean, if cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb hanoi if we have to.
now wait a second!  i thought burt shot you.
it means i wasn't what everyone thought i was...  i was a fake.
who came?
obviously not. look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
mister laplante...
what about her?  let's c ut up the money, i want to get north.
well, i know you're busy...
how would i know.
we disappear for awhile.  we disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
have you ever speculated, mister harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
isn't that her picture?
here he comes.
one believes -— it's like any other religion...
no... she only comes to sit. two or three times a week. and i never ask questions, you know. as long as they're well behaved. i must say that i've wondered --
what's happened?
right here.
oh joy of joys!  oh, dream of dreams!  i can't believe it.  birds, birds, do you hear?  otto, bertz, heintz, hans, wolfgang, do you hear?  ve are going to clear the fuhrer's name.  fly, fly, spread the words.
see you, bob.
ah.
i have my reasons.
i started to say we're drifting apart.  a year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  today i had to call you in!
lori, move.
my money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
i'm gonna open the shop, baby, i'm gonna open the shop. i'm getting it together.
what is that? a kind of chair? i never heard of no ratan.
we don't wash 'em, ya know.
just wait, you'll see.
does anyone want another?
that's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. it was great.
i would do it again in a minute.
you can be and are wrong.
what are you trying to do?  make bert look like a fool?  he's made all the arrangements.
easy for you to suppose. while it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
so do you, fast eddie.
go home. go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
what?
cured, yes.
what? nobody, i-
but how would you find him?
we came to see professor barnhardt.
dead people?
of course not.
you wouldn't have time anyway.  we come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
nerves.
who's?
to know where that leopard went - — i'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. i was a naturalist. that hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. i used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back east. i gave that up.
no, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  um... <u>later</u>.
who did?
here.
wow.
i said i wish i'd never been born.
oh, swell. you know, mr. connel said that if things keep going the way they are, i might be seeing that promotion sooner than i thought.
i thought you said we had an hour, sir?
why are you so interested?
i moving more to communism now it's dying out.
found them?  in mercea.  the coconut's tropical!
way we hear it, the pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in wayne county.
marcie - calm down. calm down and don't do this. i want you to stay --
no.  it is the beginning. the world will never be the same.
it was amazing.
go home, sheila.
research.
faster! don't we have another gun?
because that's what i would have done...
no harm, no foul. but you want to watch out for that road. those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
i don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
there's just no way the mets will lose this game. gooden is pitching and strawberry is ready to break out.
but it doesn't eat what it kills.
i've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  i should get some sleep.
you needn't see anybody. you can come directly to my study. i'd appreciate it very much if—
what happened?
you picked her up on the ferry.
did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
we don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
this is the street he walks down every day. when he needs inspiration...
alex, it's just the zoo.
okay we'll use this. she won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
there is no such thing as magic.
melina, hauser sent me to do something.
it was my master keitel's idea.
who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
they're closing the granview. you know, theater down on biscayne?
am i unfaithful? is that what you're trying to say?
you're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- i do not care.
yes.
sure know it wasn't me. and if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, evelyn?
i've lost my taste for knickknacks--
sir, i would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. it's making my muscles tighten.
might i enquire after the situation, sir, given that i've seen of the french engineering from the ridge above?
i know, dickson. that's all very well. but you're taking too many chances. in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. in case of emergency!
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
because i like you so much.  now i've got to go.
that was grammoo's. it's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. come here, i'll diagnose your head.
cheers.
we'll see about that.
you put it back in the wrong place... do you like renoir?
look, i'm no expert, but--
...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny-five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters -- in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and god forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and god forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
forget it, pissboy!  you tell argon he can call my lawyer.
there must be some connection between the plane and this place. they must have deliberately brought us here. why, bob? what reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
who invited you?
wait a....you're not listening! i'm not on your side....
i don't think so...
do try to sleep, bob.
it's shorted out or something!
have they said anything about our area?
but what?
look.  can i pay you properly?  you don't have to tell him what you got. send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  give it to charity.  or something.
okay. then you can be of use.
positano is beautiful. remember when we were there, rex? we stayed in the santo pietro? that hotel on the cliff?
not to a nurse.  sleep is a cure.
as i said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
i'm getting ready to watch a video.
we must speak again, mr. gardiner, many times!
whose house is it?
oh really? that's great.
why would she lie about it?
insomnolesence...
if i didn't go.
--is that what this is about, sean? the field's medal? do you want me to go home and get it for you? then will you let the boy--
he can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
i know you don't.
jesus...
offscreen gunfire. that jewish atomic clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
i'm fine, honey. let's just try and forget about tonight.
well, one day i'm invited skiing, the next day i'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. you tell me.
what can you steal from a man already lost his life?
i'll leave. but look at me. look at my face, jackie. i'm not lying. i met you and your mother. i told you then that i'd lost my memory. [beat] there was no one for miles around so i know you know there's no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
he's afraid of you, harold.  he knew you'd want to fight him.  he doesn't know anything about fighting.  he hates pain.
yeah. couldn't find a thing. this is the way we figure it.  wynant goes to julia's apartment. he finds morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  they have a fight. but he figures he don't want to do anything then.... morelli might squeal.  so he goes away. he don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him, so that julia will think it's all blown over. then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
simone, i recognize the shirt you're wearing.  i gave it to viktor on his birthday.
let me finish, dear.  you had your say, now let me have mine...
no, after you.
i told you, i'm good at this.
doesn't it look like it's waving? it's kind of like it's saying "hi, vanessa. will you be my mommy?"
no.  it's felony possession of marijuana.
pardon me?
immediately.
don't worry about coming up with anything. it's cool.
where --
there wasn't any way to explain it.
hey, that was last year.
how 'bout you?
she never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
yeah...
shut up!
no, elden, i need to...
bullshit!
she's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
we're stuck with this fucking shit...
it was just something that got out of hand. did anyone get hurt?
why, i think it's very sweet of the children--
your "father"?
pray he's color-blind...
maybe if you saw a good doctor...
yeah.  except they screwed up.  i don't think they got the will.
arnie, i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass.
no. i couldn't.
pretty good. i'm friends with dr. gaskell, too.
honey, you're not supposed to do that.
anyway, i was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- i didn't think you'd be interested.
how can i act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
i'm like a bad penny. i always turn up.
a rich actress.
go you huskies...
in that case give us the articles. we'll sign at once. we know all the details...
i think so.
i'm going to call the police. i'm going to watch you play the great baron with the police. aristocrat! aristocrat! 
you're thinking of mr. wizard.  this guy's an eccentric genius.
for a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, i felt that i had wronged him. but then --
that's their problem.
i know... it's the russian soul.
don't be absurd. you'll be killed.
i don't know. he's your boy.
brad. i don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
oh yeah, since when?
sure.
i want to go back to the clock people. i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. what's happened to jelly?
duncan, you are absolutely gallant. if cora doesn't marry you, i shall.
like what?
copy air force one. welcome to the party.
i just want you to like me.
thank you, spearchucker. i'll certainly take a look at these. where the hell did you ever get that name?
oh no, amy, pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched.
good-bye.
is that why you became a nazi? so you could talk about jews incessantly?
-- i don't care who you are. you could've been killed. every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. and we look out for each other.
just give them the facts.  they can leap to their own conclusions.
listen, i got a crazy favor to ask.
we outgrew each other.
i think we should say some words over the grave.
don't leave me here to die -- theo, please -- you can't let me die --
they say we must pray to their evil god. we say we will not.
yeah?
well, when you're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
occasionally you lose.
they could eat you.
where did you get this?
how could he?
thanks.  they weren't related to humpty dumpty, were they? tweedle dum and tweedle dee?
that's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
how was your date?
as i told you about english policemen.
i'm sorry, i must go.
rocco!
no, no ... come on in.
what's your friend's name?
what's funny about that? if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. the world is full of larry mitchells.
this condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
well... where can we go?
thank you, donny.
not "we", sidney, you!
somethin' like that.
i got it all ready. here.
farewell, my cuz.
no but you didn't defend him either! didn't want to rock the boat.  guess the ride was too smooth. filmore i was acting under legal counsel!
you've never even been around one.
'code blue'...
he had the detonators!  theo?  theo!
yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
must be in love to manage that.
it would be worth the risk.
what happened?
seventh, files section.  what should i do?
stephen, i'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
no, i'm good.
maybe miss wolf has them.
it's a strange world isn't it? do you know what building the woman lives in?
too bad we have to waste all that time.
it's big, right jahn?
no. she ate a pistol for lunch one day.
how?
because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
you really don't need anyone?
i think so.
extra ordinary, yes.  but first, you tell me about the headless horseman.
be quiet, chick--i'm trying to think--  this deficiency bill is going to be read in the senate tomorrow.
you got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
oh, frederick!
answers.
my name is kader, ali ... saari kader ... in other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. i could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. by obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. and that's why i told you to kill the french policeman: because the french wouldn't have let you do it. if you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
what's he sayin'?
okay.....
thank you, dad.
is he your boyfriend?
said he's not an actor.
fish, i'm really sorry. i just...i owe you man.  desert.
do you recognize my voice?
sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
he has a little dog.
what?
uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now i'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
and they frighten you?
oh, he's fine! i just heard from him. he's bombing all these places...
lemon or lime?
fuck you. this shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
ready, your honor.
don't do this, hap...
and the spare is safely sitting in jerry's garage.
he was down in the shop.
it's complicated...
jenny?
yeah, pooh-bear.  dude is a big-time cook. i'm talking dire.
yeah, from boston.
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
so where do you go from here?
i look forward to the sport.  take him.
right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind new york city is-is anti-semitism.
erasmus hall. that's in brooklyn, isn't it?
what the hell is that smell?
nobody.
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
arlight, then.  cheers.
it's a long way to go for a date.
you do?
just dull.
what?
what? it's a perfectly good word, ain't it. how much time i got?  goddam sand thing drive you crazy. kee-rist. spelling never was a very strong point with me. even in school.
yes, papa.
he's clever and he's cautious in his way. if he knew i think he'd advise her to do what i want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— i don't think he knows.
call me next week.  we'll talk about it.
i've seen you going by on your board, but i didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
try cates.  and let's talk in private, okay?
who is he, pop?
thanks, mr. gittes.
who don't work?  let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  no elevator either and shit.
which number do you want, george?
this is our first "date" date.
that's your problem, man. you can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. those guys are right. you are "money".
six. i go red next year.
well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
you got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
i'll show epps.  he'll be sorry when i get this thing open.
sorry--but i'm on a vacation--
well, senor de l'arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  shall we?
yeah, intensive care ward.  my god-hey, max, i think she's... i think she's giving me the eye.
don't belong?
plus running the opium concession for the whole eighth army.
if they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
were we always explorers?
yeah.  that's it.
the ear is from a missing person maybe?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
at a funeral.
will you shut up!
you'll figure it out. i'm not worried about you. keep writing.
yeah. and it is cold in here. hello, glaucus.
you didn't know.
and now for that twentieth crack—
yeah, well, couldn't i take a look now?
she did?
like what?
i do.  it feels like how being in love should be.  floating through a dark blue sky.
yes, sir.  but so do we.
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
will you get the fuck out of here.
i have a question...
let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
well... sure...
holy cow.
then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
because when we get down there --
mr. lingk and i are going to...
stop it --
get out of our way.
in the morning i'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. mcnamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
what does that mean?
who kills prince humperdinck? at the end, somebody's got to do it. is it inigo? who?
it's hanson, he's evil. let's get him!
i...i...
i just happened to be walking by... all of a sudden, the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... they just about ran smack into me. the creeper recognized me, and i knew he knew i recognized him... if the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. i'm telling you, the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. but the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, i took off... one more second, and i would have been dead.
just the way the world works.  look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know.
you know why i want to do it. just do it.
this is forgery. it is very clever.
a mr. paul ganapolos, he's here alone.
next.
up the organization!  bastard.
i was only strangling her... i've killed hundreds of women. it doesn't mean a thing.  pootchkie, you're over-reacting. this is our night. it's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. she's just a plaything, a trifle... you're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. i adore you. i worship you. i want to make you my bride.
look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  it's the only thing i know.
i need to know that.
you haven't told me everything.
and a leader. didn't she meet castro on foreign exchange?
exactly. the ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
i was sort of hoping to get out of--
peanut...
yeah, i guess so.  what are you going to do now that you're home?
he will be... when he can't write, he drinks.
i'm not sure i know you well enough -- i don't think i'm comfortable.
find the rockets.  if they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
please, as a favour to me? so i won't  be the only girl?
what 'business'?
i'm stag.
especially not your dad.
well, he died. you know who else died?
why?
not until you are eighteen.
america, we shall see.
how do i get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
have you never wondered -- and i mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
oh.
there he is!
why are you telling me this?
i don't know.  it was like a tug. something tugged us.
so what's up?  what'd i miss?
what?
get out.
she's pretty special.
diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. maybe if i saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--i don't think even that would do it--
and diamonds in the front.
you're late, eric.
yes, he does.
we need it to eat electronics, man ...not you.  get it on me....
where'd you learn to do that?
the rest of the house is probably worse.  when can you and i get started?
we're friends.
i suppose. i mean they're obviously all bonkers, but i guess they're harmless.
he's coming to get me rachel.
eat shit....
it's the most beautiful city i've ever seen! what is it?
that's not him.
like this - like how?  it's your fault. you're to blame.  i was saving myself.
i didn't know the c.i.a. had psychiatrists.
don't be absurd; it's only a play.
mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and i believe he wants me to help you a little. you see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. don't you believe it. sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. now i was thinking before you came, of coming over to cross corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my godson -- and other things.
i blame myself.
i thought all witches were benign and good.
i must be stern with you.
the death of my father.
do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
duty calls!
you had your chance, james. now i’m looking for a bigger thrill.
when i have fifty pounds.
yes, sir.
if ya win it could make ya, too.
he used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
must be a garrison in town. we're in occupied territory, boys.
shh. i'm not going to tell you not to go.
will you join me for dinner?
bondjamesbond. what brings you here?
that's what i said.
okay...
i said, maybe i'll change my name again.
you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
is that the question?
he was cute, huh? of course whenever i meet a guy, i'm wearing no make-up.
we're out of here.
they are robots!
what you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
okay.
it's not your friend. it keeps you sucking. remem- ber the old bum's lungs?
that's a lie.
thank you.
are you gonna open the safe?
merry christmas...
umm. and would admiral kirk have access to such information?
how long have i been on gateway station?
it was like some big fucking secret!
could be.
canada is saving us!!
uh, why, why are you doing this?
you're my brave boy.
thank you, mr. leibel. thank you very much.
you bastard! you tortured him. you tortured him, you bastard. where is he?
how long has dolores been driving that bus, mr. otto?  how many times has she steered clear of danger? what went wrong that morning?
radiation shield, you think?
bullshit! you're bluffing!
yes.  cyberdyne systems, model 101.
what does the omega 13 do?
it suits you.
like a principal?
every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
this little thing says i can't.
you poor, poor boy.
seen one like it before?
what would you like to know, sir?
you think i got any kind of a voice?
most new yorkers never notice it - most americans have never heard of it.
i didn't know that. mine's still brown.
you know what i'd like to see? meat in a cone. you could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? the "o.j." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? your "jim jones kool- aid" that was exactly that?
you like me. how come?
i think so.
hmm. it's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
that's shiva? what's he giving the priest?
now i get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. you're part of a cult.
how are your teeth getting along?
he's right. do you have any idea what van gogh's "vase with twelve sunflowers" is worth?
i know.
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse?
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?
it won't last.
me, right? that's why you're not saying.
i warned you!
that is correct. i was engaged to render an opinion.
this is swell.  where's michael? i've got things to get straight with him and i can't wait on line.
no clubs.  i wanna reach the top!  carnegie hall...!
everything has it's drawbacks.
i suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, louise, i'm all out of ideas.
points at the motel.
what does that mean?
no, bully for you.
it puzzles me so badly. i've done terrible things but i can't consider myself a terrible man. i've killed three people and i'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
i don't know yet, doctor. and i won't know until i test it.
and that will be a good place to end this study.
glad to have you, david.  how's the new office?
trans ocean travel.
then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
i think i just really hurt ray's feelings.
thanks, professor.
moffo!
no, i can't say that i have.
why?
that is our quest.  you know much that is hidden o tim.
i was lonely.  you took advantage
bad?
two lumps, madame?
about what ?
i don't know.  i kind of thought i ought to be here.  you know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
you were expecting a deliver y that day?
such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little nell from the country? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
what?
no, man.
what gives you that idea?
'cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  you got a gift.
what if i have a previous engagement?
excellent. dc mitchell is a rising star, mr. stevens. under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
i don't know.
and there's the winner of the truman capote look-alike contest.
honesty.
i surprise you? now that's news.
virgin mary musta snuck that one in.
there ya go. always remember, focus on the peach...
yes.
have you ever studied organic chemistry?
as far as the office.
i always said you were a gentleman.
but i promised your mother.
what are you talking about? this bar is packed with professional people!  everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... luckily, i'm currently off men, so i've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
i was desperate. it was gross.
your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
loretta, never have kids.
yes sir.
oh shit!
inside the sphere.  look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  there's no head, so i'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
mom, i'm sorry.  i wanted to tell you. but it never felt right.
we never really shared one.
fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
too late?
i'm sorry... did i wake you?
think about it, fink. writers come and go; we always need indians.
uncle joey's little girl.  can't get the taste out of her mouth.
give me some?
what d'you mean?
evenin', ma'am.
what time did you leave?
i didn't see any medical records in there.
not a whole helluva lot. his final transmission was mangled. about something or someone called "ahab". whatever it is, it cost him his life.
it's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. the more i think about it the more irritated i get.
i'm just so lonely.
yeah, i'll bet.
i can't remember at the moment.
no! no!
forget it, mookie.
but i ain't got you...
when i'm in high school i'm not going to play any football. i'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  what did you do in high school?
that's the guy. eddie calls him up and says, "hey, what do you want me to do. i'm over here at poly prep. i got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. she wants me to come in back and collect. what should i do?
an hour, two at most.
what?
certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
get more coffee.
you're not gonna believe this...
he didn't want to lose any more.
over forty years now. me and ray gibson out there.
caviat emptor, mother. let the buyer beware.
what if--you're vomiting?
-- no.
they know what her tits look like.
and because the dead walked.
it's too late.
they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. the phoenix asteroids... from what i've heard, doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. nobody knows why. they just glow as they drift around the universe. imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. the universe is alive, doolittle. i thought it was all empty, but it isn't. in between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. there are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on earth has ever seen... no one but the phoenix asteroids...
you got a minute?
you can keep it -- i've got a whole pack...  now what were you saying?
yes, from the west.  he went undercover and and followed her here,
oh, the thing! oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
yeah, it was.  how you get up here?
it's just part of your whole sick cynthia thing.  taking care of her fucking dog.  going to her fucking synagogue.  you're living in the fucking past.
who told you to wear men's clothes?
my father told me i shouldn't talk to you.
[perfectly friendly, my dear.] at last, i have really a secure living for us. we can travel or anything we choose.
if these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am i?
top of the world at the stratosphere. it's completely secure. <b> int. fbi jet -- next </b> cosgrove and espinoza listen to this conversation.
comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
or kat....
i'm not in the way.  andy, am i in the way?
--and the ass of the man who adores her.
hit me.
uh, right.  a... news story.
dynamite --
one: it's illegal. two: i didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
older.
yes?
i can't do it.
you dump her and i'll give you cash.
have to talk about something.
and you know, he really does not.
for how long?  face it, lee, she's playing both sides.
good.
we all end up dead. it's only a question of how. and why.
no.
you think i --
can you see the other pirs?
what can it hurt is they offend me.
you are.
which way are the rooms?
i know.  it's terrible!
because he's <u>my friend</u>.
whish the circumstances were different.
that’s just it. the sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  testa di cazzo! hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... he hasn’t gone to hell too soon... and neither will you, mr lamont!
no, you don't need all that starch.  you're getting too fat.
no matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
everybody needs a hob...
the only thing left for them is the city grid...  ...they may not do it.
no, i think you'll find i looked like he could have? by accident even? he's up here spraying the scenery all day.
i don't think that's such a safe idea
apparently, fine.  he's coming into work.  that's the good news ...
well, i bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
tom? only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to sally an' say you was...
i don't think i am.
lose 'em.
wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. reprogrammed him.
this way.
i know.
i told you.  she kills him.
too right, youth. that's why i need you to lead the troops.
what's up, babe? something's eating you.
yes, i'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously.
and what about the ones you don't save?
i said like a comanche, not this comanche.
no, they won't - honestly.
yeah... look man, what i gotta say. it's just you, me and the rats, right? alright... well... sabu's back.
something like that.
we'll let you go. you leave the pods and the pem.
i am. ben meeker.
she lives near eddie?
it's what i do for a living. it's how i make money.
that's why i hate experts.
you betcha.
go where?
i... i don't think i'm going to make it sir...
oh no.
what's this?
i guess i would've felt sorry for the universe.
put some butter on it--or ice?
that's okay.  i'm probably, you know, busy.
she's a broad!  got it!  just some broad!
but even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. you won't even know it's happened.
it's okay, puff.
i'm on the way with a team to relieve you. what's the latest?
why did you call me?
how much i got, what?
all right. you're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. they're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. is that right?
are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
you boost her -- ?
a chicken?
i know you.
'cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. his ass belongs to me.
well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  let's talk about it.
what?
that's exactly what we don't have, doctor.
mike.  oh, the christening.  i meant to call...
but all these people...
i sincerely hope so.
look, you don't fuck with me, i don't fuck with you, right?
you're no bargain either, pal.
and larry?...
more or less.  son, i'm sorry. they got us.
excuse me?
there isn't one, unless corbett's men get here before the plane does.
hi.
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time.  what about the hit list.
yes sheriff.
he's part of the mix. sid 6.7 is a composite.
well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick.
margie. thought you might need a little warm-up.
what the hell is that?
oh her.
say the words, "i understand."
what about marcus?
that's great. i haven't sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa. what are we going to sing? what... bones, what are we going to sing?
go ahead.
look, general!  a darling baby soldier!  don't try to be a hero!  just make sure you come back in one piece!  next!
i didn't think i could sleep. i'm surprised you could. are you all right?
wait a second, i --
my math program. the superintendent said he'd fund it.
oh, you've already met rick, mademoiselle?
i disappear. it’s not about me.
is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese?
i? -- oh, no. i do only what i take pleasure in doing.
he didn't kill her.
glen. not now. i mean, we're here for tina now, not for ourselves.
hey, listen to this... i think this is related to our dr. satan.
i have not, but i very much want to.  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron?
i... i just want you to be happy, mary.
thanks.
sure, i'll give you a shot at it, but ganz is mine.  you know, that big indian plays it for keeps...
yes... and i'm to blame for it. if you hadn't met me... if i hadn't liked you... i tried to warn you...
it's vile.
take your time. two weeks. three if you need it. we'll pay you sick leave. i don't want to lose you. you're a good man. here...
meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
i could teach her my "french flipper" trick...
better than that.  we become partners.  only in this territory and only on loads we run. and you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  you pay us zero.  why we get is thirty percent of the load. product or cash.  "and why," you're thinking, "would i be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? is he chipping?  crazy for my love? too many mojitas?"  and the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  it is because sonny can deliver what no one else can."
heaven help me, i love a psychotic.
me? of course! i've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
just realized that, huh?
i am sorry for all my sins.  and yours.
give eve harrington job in you office.
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. my... eh... we kidnapped it. on it there was a map that said how to come to earth. this was very important. before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
no, there's...
i wasn't going to call her. not after the way she was.
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil.
that's right.
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. i helped him to say yes. alright. you're not a robot, jeff! that's all. you got a mind of your own, don't you?
i don't care a fig for captain best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  he looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could i refuse him?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that sammy is faking his condition.
i've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
so miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. whose wearing the coconut bra now?
i know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. you're like a little whiney bitch...
you took bets on my diagnosis?
yeah dude, why is walter so pissed off?
i sort of like it. i mean, it's cute.
antonio, the choir...
stay out of this elias. this ain't your show.
don't lose hope yet, alpha!
could be important work.  might as well bring it back.
actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
huh? huh huh.
poor fucker my ass...
yeah.
totally!
i didn't kill myself. i died from a blow to the head. how'd it happen? i have to know.
but of course.
it's a rave!  boy, if i ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
that's a picture of me in japan.
and don't ever try to see me again.
please.
remo.
shut up.
okay, i'm a little tender.
burn??  are you kidding?  it's freezing!
he was a nice horse.
i'm not listening!
better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
will you please turn back.
you didn't need to do that. you just didn't.
what do you need?
i'm sorry... you said it hurt?  why?
it's not for me. it's for love and happiness forever.
jody, wait.
sorry.  my pajamas are tailored. would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  no more immodest than a kilt, you know.
that sounds so great, man. yes. yes. hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
that was cool, wasn't it? you know, i don't even know where that came from. i just opened my mouth and it came out. after i said it i thought, that's a cool line, i gotta remember that.
god, i wish i could say the same thing.  what about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. scrabble, knock-knock jokes, anecdotes about famous dead italians....
anthony's ii!
i always thought when i grew up i'd know what to do about things like this...i don't even know if he's serious....
fucked up.  that's what they said i was.
... yes.
i know you're not calling jimmy.
if you want seconds, then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
joad. tom joad.
i'm okay.  i'm okay.
that's interesting.
it's cold.
hi mom.
c'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over greenland, or something?
i am nina ivanovna yakushova, envoy extraordinary, acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin. present me to your colleagues.
no, that could not be done, mr. ruby. there are a good many things involved in that.
wow, you walked out with my mother?
forget it, quentin.  it can happen to the best of us.  now let's get squared away.
the other side.
you don't know that.
... it's time to get this society back on track!
because it's a job?
mr. sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
...okay.
maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
yes.
i wasn't sure you caught that.
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as i say.
oh-oh-
i'm not here.
see? there you go again.
yes, i thought that it would be best.
they're always after me for interviews.
because the sky is so clear out here.
i ain't a-stayin'. i need to ast you fer a favor.
sure i do. do i know what loneliness feels like? sure i do. i know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
i was doing it for them.
why do you have to defend her?
what are you talking about? yes we have. and we would have been beautiful about it. we would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
i think it's called "a shower". you might try it sometime.
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor. how did that happen to a non-party member?
where are you now -- can you meet me? do you know les halles?
no, no.  just waiting for a friend. good night, mrs. lieberman.
thanks for the diagnosis, ben. thank you. so let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. let's just go on in. i'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
the same old, same old.  trying to get my stuff through.
well, no, johnny, i just thought i should've been told if—
i know that.
he should be back in a couple hours.
who?
oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
thank you, sir.  i'm see threepio, human cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, artoo detoo.
big talk... desperate guy.
no.
all stop, sir.
you don't have to say anything
you too, sweetie, the best.
well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  they mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  now, some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  malcolm was right!  look, life found a way!
shut up. it's gonna work just fine,
do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. do you fucking understand?  i want you to move your ass outta neutral. i want a bunch of panthers served up on a fucking plate. i want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
or not so recently?
you sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
yes.
i could have told you that.
well, i am.
i need you so much, claudette.
he is what his life has made him!
don't mention it... pleased to be of service any time.
are you with me buddy?
didn't think about it at the time. so no, it didn't strike me odd.
well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. and anyone who says they do is lying. we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
stop beatin', man. you ain't doin' nobody no good.
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  he created the voices after the fact.
oh, i understand.
you don't like eve, do you?
it's unbelievable. the man never ages.
m'hm.
no, sir?
show me how it operates.
and you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
yes. that's kind of how it was.
don't start thinking about it.  is the tape off?
you ain't going in alone?
i do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
still gonna smell it.
what's happening?
i didn't kill the watchman.
rain.
i don't need this--i know all about my condition.
mr. gardiner, my pleasure.
well, i show a 95% probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula...
i meant sally.
let's go in.
you heard. look for the knife.
oh sure.  of course.
you know, i-i-i don't think many couples could handle this. you know, they could just break up and remain friends.
i'm not afraid of his words.
i don't want to fight either. look... uh -- i love you.
what's in it?
the only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. so you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  good luck.
what?
that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.
he tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
i lied.  the journey will be longer than i said.
i would have anyway.
don't stop!
doc.  ainge...
tehronne? tehronne done this?
then why do you shake so?
the other reason?
assuming your mysterious nun in right.
no. not really.
is that paul goodman? no. and be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. hi, doug! douglas wyatt. "a foul-rag-and-bone shop-of- the-heart."
you don't look anything like a three- year-old.
that is when we will go in.
this is all the exercise i need...
don't worry about it. i'm not gonna do anything. what am i gonna do? i'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in rome, and the 727 out of lisbon last year.  major player.				*
i sure as hell hope so.  let's go.
first class.
you're great with the advice, clark. maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
what d'ya think, jerko! you're the award!
my companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about england, which i answered as best i might.  but this best, i am bound to say, was bad enough.  i knew nothing about england, and i invented a thousand stories which i told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
this used to be my secretary's room.
we sure like havin' you.
human?
you still believe in god?
promise?
they got a sign on him in front of greely's?
do you owe markers?
you just cuddle. you come to hug... to kiss. you don't *come* here to watch the movie.
think about it, eve! everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  he's said and done things your husband would never do ...
what crime did you commit.
aww, you ain't that bad. you just need a little flava. first thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
you bought her some time, kola. ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
hell, yeah. to her dumb country ass, compton is hollywood. close as she's ever been, anyway.
you people really don't like dogs.
yes  siree -- that's the idea. get them all here and then say: "look, folks -- here's daniel webster, my guest of honor." golly, i can see their eyes pop already.
do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
i must insist that you leave.
it's her!  i'm telling you.  she whispered and turned on the music.  she's trying to contact me!
anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
i don't rattle, kid. but just for that i'm gonna beat you flat.
you... she said i didn't love her.
i'll try.
but what about your research -- ?
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
what do you mean?
i can handle that.
when i was a little girl.  three or four. if i had a nightmare, i'd bring my dad in. the dream would always get better.  he always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. nancy when did it stop?
you're insane.
same here. come over and visit when you get the chance.
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend.
she's still alive?
can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
he said he has to find a perfect dozen.
getting around, martins.
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.?
alright, well you're gonna have to leave. you're gonna have to go.
oh, my god, you're right!  i'm on the one...  well, let's scoot...
you didn't do that badly.
look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what i mean.  ooh, i like her.
yes.
...to decompose. and i love my dad very much. so i came to earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and i met you and... well, my dog tells me i just might be in love with you.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
we oughta get a couple of those rockets.  voom!  we're there before we left!
ohh!
i just came out to say goodbye.
in a democracy, cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. your brother's practice...
what happened to it?
yes.
that's just what you would say.  this is so unreal.  i'm dreaming...
i don't know. it was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
starting up.
i've never loved any one before, gregory, and i do love you -— you must know it -- but jacqueline's my sister —— whom i had lost and have found again....   
guess i must've learned.
get wise to yourself, sally--you're no sob story.
"..in which all the history of the universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..protect us from evil.."
it doesn't make sense.
you still want to go home, moose?
no, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant pg&e fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  but you know what?  they're wrong.
weird.  why don't i slip into something comfortable?
here. take my card. wait a minute... here's a special one. for top-shelf clients.
we've been set up all along.
killed last night, in a tavern! come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
i... i think i can... clarify...
well, wedding cake freezes.  this we know.
pardon me.  i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here! birthday guests at three o'clock!
your ruse. your cunning attempt to trick me.
ev, it's not my fault!  i'm trying to tell you this incredible --
when?
c'mon, don't lie.
welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  load that gun!
that jelly you were talking to right here?
what does?
will i ever be normal?
did you get an erection?
i don't carry dapper dan. i carry fop.
he's busy right now.
the room has a bug in it.
... will perry ...
28   continued:
not sleepy, either?
it wasn't that bad.
i'm sorry about that.  really.  but --
is that so?
of course you are. you're a professional...
somethin's in my room.
for approval.
atley jackson. how is that one? how's the leg... ?
hal? well, hal and i have been friends for a long time.
no.
hey - i'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, doctor.
he don't have to worry. he'll trade the krauts for a six-burner gas range. maybe a deep freeze too.
lenny.  calm down.  this is what i do.
could develop.
why?
are we talking to a union spokesman?
what will they be made of?
check out the personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
i don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  she didn't even know who i was.  it's just... tradition.
here, here.
finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which i rose and gave to this body!  mr. president--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. and now, he is trying to blackmail this senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! to prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this deficiency bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  gentlemen--i--i have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. i apologize to this body for his appointment--i regret i had ever known him. i--i'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and i refuse to listen to him any longer! i hope every member of this body feels as i do!
don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
okay, martini. that's okay. now you watch me.
you must have been very proud.
yeah, it would be kinda great.
looks like it, don't it?  here's the woman, ma.
then he will die!
i know it isn't.
dyslexic?
thank you.
let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
we'll do that tomorrow, okay?  it's lockdown time.
i've fallen in love.
boiler, we're alive. my heart.
that's why mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
in three months! papa.
nothing.  why are you doing this?  i thought god didn't exist.
eladio cruz.
you might have to, if you went with me. ever try to keep warm in a c-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
how dare you talk to me like that! do you think i'm like all the rest of those pirates?! like mayer and warner? is that what you think--?!
all right.
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic.  pardon me.  excuse me, sorry, sorry...
they haven't found it yet -- listen, pollux ...
what?
thanks, binky.  can you see bromdingna island yet?
so. five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. no woman since then?
sure, man --
no. no, that's ray, here. ray, uh...  ray... little weasel.
sure. we aim to.
yes.
thanks.
right... this just glided along.
i don't like him.
wait a minute -- i thought we were negotiating here.
ok. increase the peace.
if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, mr lombard. and we want it before you get yourself killed...
it wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
i guess you have to get back home soon?
why did she have to die?
the sheriff?! we don't need the sheriff!!! we need to get the hell out of here!
no. we got a picture, though. one of the waitresses had a camera.  god, we were just kids.  that was something, wasn't it?
yeah.  least i think so.  twenty- six years this march.
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
look, i stand to lose everything by this.
i'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
ye-es?
i got to, mama. i know daddy wants to see him.
and she left shortly after that?
they're in a hurry to grow up.  they don't know about consequences or responsibility.  that's being sixteen too.  i promise you one thing...
<u>liza</u>!
now, how is miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  that carl loses two batteries.  must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
make us a nice cup of tea and i'll tell you. i might even let you watch.
yes.
no kidding?
buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi.
yeah.
the precogs were wrong.
i don't know. probably out. want something to drink?
this is the phantom zone. but why did you come here from argo city?
this press we cannot control. americans, i think.
it's a pity in this...
are you o.k.?
"like this?" it's gary you're talking about.
well, i made the dean's list.
"some"?
no one. it... seemed the proper way.
accompanies hilda into the hallway.
no, sir.  i'm sure we wouldn't.
is there any blood in it?
billy ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
everythin's relative. where's that marietta pace fortune? you two didn't split up, i hope.
we'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
so do you.
someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
what do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
i don't agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
what is it?
why, no—i—  yes . . . i guess i will.
you're not my real dad.
well, when you put it that way.
stay with the children.
you're saying i have no choice.
i'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
put a bolo out on that.
a sunflower?
yeah.  i guess.
so i gathered.
that's true.  you grow up here?
still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? jane, i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
next time lets put some money on it.
"changes."
driving, talking to me...
think i'll lay down with him. only way i'll get outta here.
go ahead.
yes, thank you, mr. garrison.  your coffee's almost turkish down here but i could get used to it.
no rust?
what am i supposed to do?
the funeral's on friday.
or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. you have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. he isn't in it to hurt people. he's in it to make money.
<u>we are klingons</u>! once you control the ship, i will transfer my flag there. and we will take genesis from their own memory banks!
there's something i've gotta take care of, louis.
this is not cool.
he's excited about the script.  you should be too.  it stars you.
hey!  uh, how do i get back in?
because i called up tommy's brother joe, and i said, "joe, she's driving me crazy. why don't you take her for a couple of years?" and he said, "oh no!" i know i sound like a terrible woman...
look.
man, fuck you!!!
she would never.  never.  even think of that.
yeah, right. she wishes. look at that big ass.
cool.
a brain. extremities.
i don't.
yea, art thou there?
good night, brenda.
but what about thomas?
no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.
no, it could take me hours. you know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - i wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
stop it, wladek.
blue is cold.
oh yeah, bari. i've been there.
no, it's fine. thanks for making the call, i guess.
you must be thinking of a different daughter.
uhh! would you die already!
do i know you?
i didn't come here to drink scotch.
they won't get a conviction. the husband called it in as a suicide. the forensic guys weren't thinking murder. i'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
true.  but why?
what's she saying?
we were partners.  if it weren't for luther i'd still be hustlin' pinball down at gianelli's.  i don't need anything more than i got.
what the devil do you mean?  you have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
shit!
what?
ok.
how old are you?
i got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
oh fuck.  and we left the top down. you want to run for it?
you sure you don't want to eat something?
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt.  geez louise.
now you've fallen into his trap. when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
mom, stop with this already. of course i love you. you're my mother.
 all right.  one more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
i'm not too young. juliet was my age.
one phone call every day. just tell us what you've seen. don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
i told you...
and so will m'sieu giron.
you were behind the door?
good girrrl!
why'd he have to do that to that girl?
this war's put an end to decent things. i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
when?
these guys back home don't give a fuck about the supreme court and any of this bullshit! they want things to quiet down. they want you to walk away from -
never heard of him, who is he?
you mean with malkovich?
that explains it. i'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.
fine, thank you, but
here, take my jacket.
i know, kid.  i know.  me too.
that's what i thought until you came riding in.  i saw your car over at the gas station.  it's cool.  want to take me for a ride?  desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
i see.  but i hope you have a lot of sugar.  eli is ready to go to zook's.
i like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
here i am, my angel.
negative five?
well, what time is it?
well...
it's perfectly safe. i promise.
and totally irrelevant.
these are fishermen, alvin.  they don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  specially gossip.
i fucking don't know.  what do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  we didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  we dug a hole and we put her in it. your guess is as good as mine.
be patient.
a half-pint.  i'm talking gallons.
imagine. all this admiration in just one room.
okay... what about strickland?
commandeer.  we're going to commandeer a ship.  nautical term.
fuck you!  let go of me!
what for?
cut it out. just cut it out, okay? it's starting to get on my nerves.
mmm.  hmm.
i hear the china club is a laugh.
it was on that night karl met his destiny. and i met mine. almost.
they killed the goose.
what is it?
i'll have you out in a few hours.
'bye, honey.  i won't wait up.
it made them uncomfortable. and if they didn't sleep well i'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. sister where are your sheets?  do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
but what does it do?  this... sphere.
so you were cheated.
it's just the woman and the kid?
this is important to me.
i'm sorry for everything.
no thanks.
well perhaps better than my first. 
johnny... life is so different from the way it was. one day you'll see what i did was best for both of us.
‘that which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
fine. show me the body.
uh huh.  and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  i				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
moonby. got any winstons?
i didn't say that. all i said was you're an idiot. hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
no, no, no! i winged him, and he dropped his gun.
i got there from "coin," dude. coin, coin... kwaaaan.
leia! leia's my sister.
no, but... i don't know... sometimes.
this.
surely you've heard the stories? the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
we must have alliance with england to prevail here. you achieved that! you saved your family, increased your lands! in time you will have all the power in scotland!... yet you grieve.
my bed.
yeah, baby, i know what you like to hear...
your friend, big al? it should have been you.
and whose fault is that?  if we'd won in vietnam ...
it's all right.
what has everybody got against me this morning?
all these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
that's about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts.  you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
you promised to let me kiss you.
you think i haven't been trying!  it's like there was never anything there.  just water.
something's not right.
yes.
i'll get dr luczak, we can trust him.
the one who lives in the white house across the bay?
then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. and i know what it is -- now you'll have to kill me.
my promise.
better late than never. korean war hero, sheriff for near thirty years-- buddy deeds memorial p--
you're not goin' anywhere!  get on the fuckin' floor!
what happened to him?
i just know.
yes, my lord.
just yesterday.
oh, i don't know. up-tight. frigid.
that's what i get for dressing in a hurry.
cold war's over, jerry.
it was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
that's a lie. you could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
in here!
he's here somewhere.  find him.  the sub's on it's way.  go!  c'mon!
i need you.
what do you want to do?
egyptian mail. morning edition.  run!
who's "we"?
cigarette?
didn't i just say that? fucking listen. anyway, i did it all for carolyn. he never appreciated her, but i worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. so, i came back for you. just like i did for carolyn.
if i may, your majesty, i would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
that's touching, elle, but we need an alibi.
oh, i'll represent alright.
boy, that looks tasty.  what is that?
that's great!
what's that?
a boy or girl?
maybe i already have.
if it works you mean.
i like the tent better.
they'll be back.
leavemealone!
that's young nehru. he's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. if they don't ruin him at cambridge -- wave! wave! -- he may amount to something.
"the fifth one this week"!
no, stamp. i ain't.
oh golly, oh just what i've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  how come?
"my dear president"...
gimme a break.
no. but now that you mention it, i did talk to a handsome executive at paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
to keep?
i'd give you a very good price.
no, it's me, billy. i need time. i'm still adjusting to my mom.
and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...no, thank you. i'll take my chance down here.
it's a secret.  i can't even tell you, my dear.  i've got an important idea to work on.
maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
it will?
you'd take a polygraph on it?
the guy is terminally selfish!
cramps?
i am quaid.
left you this place.
i guess i lost:
you lied to me?
i just hate to see you pining away. it makes me want to vomit, frankly.  broken hearts are for assholes.
rob reiner and quentin tarentino?
so is the town, i notice!
we thought it was poison.
yep.
judy, i want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days i've had in a year.
oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
what's the pay?
nope.
where is he?
i did not ask you to, did i?
you're kidding.
we cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
dudley's guys.
that's what i said.
goddammit!  that's outrageous.
be brave. he'll come back - with or without gas.
right, now i need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
what?  what's okay?
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
you are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
you'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
too late for what, dear child?
there's nothing to figure out.
can't say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  now take me -- i make my living as a stone mason.  it's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  you could be -- a journalist.
i lay awake nights in a cold sweat, i want this party to be like some- thing mom would have made for you, i want it to be perfect --
oh--hello!  i got the flowers. that was sweet of you--thank you.
but he isn't a menace! he told me what he came here for.
oh. okay. well, so long. enjoy your visit.
i hope so.
she admits it's her fault.
or once.
and into a black dress.
i can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  ever. i'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
yes, but we know who it was, and i will tell you, agent starling, what you know to be true.  i offered the bounty.  it was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  do you  agent starling:  do you know <u>god</u>? 
brad.
if he's not out, why are they here?
they can't be serious. the ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
i'm sure he's matured since then.
she's up in heaven now.  she didn't hear.  she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  there's nothing nicer than that.  chow!  harold ryan wants chow!
i didn't say that i would run... i just...
good night??!
i got some money i can give you -
nothing... i was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
no way.  everybody's going sailing. if you don't want to take me, just say so.
last night i slept with a member of the war council.
when did you make the switch?
isn't there a guard?  a janitor? a fucking cleaning woman? i'll take a burglar!  somebody's gotta be in th...
you're not buying a car, for christ sake.  you're having your wife killed.  i'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  it's thirteen, or it's nothing.

dr. john whittlesley.

any friends?
you know her?
i see. so playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
for an introduction.
he's a gambler.
your fuckin' head, huh? don't fuck around, tony.
blue. this blue.
don't you die on me!! this is baby suggs quilt. is that what you planning!?
oh -- i'm not near ready yet.
dumbshit.
you talking to me?
that's where trouble comes into paradise. but the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. wanna see what "spiderman" number one looks like?
pink.
fucking tigers. they got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of double a or southern cal.  how was the party?
there has to be something that we can do.
it's great when people who work together can become real friends.
marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
what do you have in mind?
punch?
those attitudes do not exist in me.
'cept he wasn't before, was he?  you know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. you're fat.
uh-huh. lived there till i was twenty or so and then moved to chicago when i got married.
you the duff that didn't come up with his end when little jeff was sent up?
what?
victor, tell me why! trust me!
by storytellers, of all things.  every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  then it's held prisoner for a while.  in the story.
where's scully?!
yeah you do.
you--uh--you better relax, senator. you'll be plumb wore out.
he's nothing but a hypocrite. he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
oh, i'm all through talkin'. now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
well, i'm really pleased to hear a confession.

a wonderful woman, boy.
well, he's popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
so, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
the ramp?
is that the logical thing to do, spock...?
fuck you, kid.
the bitch shot me, is what happened.
isn't that beautiful?
we'll be broke in four weeks.
it's not like i'm miles away.
but you could do it, baby. we could use the bread...
what's in it for me?
you want me to kick it open?
i just tested for one...
around.
you left a dead prostitute out in the desert? alone?
you lost me, sid.  who?
and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
oh, i believe it.
thank you... very much.
we can't do this.
is that a trick question? c'mon, i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
you can't have just one.
what'd neptune tell you?
i know what it is.  i just can't believe what i'm hearing.  what has she talked you into?
sorry, stu. it's all part of the deal. we've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
i'll just tell my wife.
then what's he talking about?
four days.
i don't know. there were others much closer. he was religious?
yeah, could be.  or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
i'll do it!
okay, karla, five seconds.  five...four...
then let me put your mind at ease .. firstly, amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and amber was a very independent young woman - she decided to leave - so she left ..
my mother's family is french, my father's was german, originally.
what the hell do you think it was about?  there's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
i just want to get married.
a loser?
when it falls off the table and turns turtle--cute?
no, i'm going.
frightened.
you're getting obvious.
search me. ask the gypsies.
i congratulate them.
don't do anything stupid, cotton. you've come to far.
nothing.
what morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
no, this has everything to do with you.
have you ever heard the saying, "he hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
oh really?  how much money did he put up?
look, i need to see him. i know where his room is. just give me a pass. i won't be long. ten minutes.
il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
i will relay the particulars of our conversation to mr. maranzano.
oh, yeah, "excuse me, sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." he'll kick our asses from here to cleveland.
but where do you come from?
we would like vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
yes, master.
also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
virgil, please.  don't do this to me.

for a good reason.
i'm fine. thanks.

jesus, look at that wall.  place almost looks like a prison.

ms. marr!

i'm telling you the truth. i lied before...

he's been acting real strange lately. he won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
according to white house personnel, hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson. but when i called the white house press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. then the p.r. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "i am convinced that neither mr. colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee."
yes.  but he didn't show up.
it's like a pop your cherry party. everyone's saying it's 'fuck or die' time.

anything else?
coming about, then.
you never really trusted me.

that's the bad blood between you and johnny?
i don't expect you'd understand.
are all of you named jones?
i will...

very talented son of a bitch. too bad we can't kill him.
so am i.
hm?
a likely story. hand it over, kid.
he fools around with his patients too.
i logged outside the g.r.a.b. site, right? then i monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? then i got these isdn numbers, right? then i tracked them back, right? then i took the one i could jack-up the easiest, right? then i called back see, they think i'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like i'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? so now they're sharing it with me, right? they think i'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. so they let me in, right? give me all these numbers. but then i don't leave, right? i'm in. i've got the key. now i just go anywhere i want.
jesus.
you're more practical than superstitious.
sir te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  we're stepping on their toes of this one.
yes.
but it's a small room, jason.
shut up.
yes.
so was i. so don't give me any shit. your business is just as bad. at least i'm up front about it. you kill people slowly. your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. now you know how it feels.
who's there?
you know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
you can't be serious.
what do you want me to say?
no, it's nothing, i... my piranha just mauled me a little when i layed their food out.

ok.
with spittle?
the day i show respect to biff tannen will be the day i win a million dollars... what's the matter, biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
for what?
i have all of the others.
about what?
how long have i been here?
my mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
a very fine-looking women.
hey.
is there any other way to disable the injector?
i'm not used to such kindness. from a beautiful woman.
whoa there, tex!  we've been through all this.
never.
i'm totally serious!
karen, it's a pleasure. how you doing?
goodbye, dear.
don't know.  but this guy's real damaged goods.  iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  now no more games, faith.  whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. come with me right now.  don't even think about it.
yes.
what about that?
listen, i'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i've sorted out all this information?
reilly! he's loaded!
yes.
well then the people you need to call are the police.
oh come on, kathryn. it's too easy. "but i thought high school was only four years." i mean, please. she knows nothing. she's seen nothing. i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. i have a reputation to uphold.
it's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
yeah. i mean, you are my brother and... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. so, i've decided to make it up to you.
maybe...?
that's rather nice, isn't it?
they'll question her.  whatever they tell her could change what happens.  no, i want you to follow her.  see if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. i'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  when they do, you call the cops.
i know. i know. help me, here. look around.
dies y nueve.
i think you'd look good in red.
i'm designated driver. i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
no. i just sit in. they don't seem to mind. they've been very congenial about it.
c'mon lloyd.
if you do the product placement...
and that is my last word on the matter.
you didn't have to do this.
i owe you shit.
my gosh, and for a while there, i was attracted to you.
why don't you tell me.
you can say that again. what do we do?
everything.
i promised myself i wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  i was so torn when you called.
you're going to get yourself up and go out?
what a great son you are, ranon.  i wish i could take you with me.  now go to sleep...
dr. arroway --
sure.
ahh, good.  then i will see them.  dismiss the rest.
i didn't mean it that way -- i was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
...once or twice. his name is charlie meadows.
who?
why didn't you give a warning signal?
maybe he ain't so tough.
why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
last time, i was here a grand total of three days.  last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and i bartered passage off.  but from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  we probably have your friend norrington to thank for that.
i know.  is *that* nothing.
doll, you and waski run on, too.
that fuckin' guinea, will knows him.
why bring it here?
he asks when he can come to visit you.  he left his address.
there's no sign of it.
i admit it - i was scared! i was shocked, in fact , by what he said. and he's so...convincing. i'm sorry if i let you down, but really, i still say he's just one opinion. i don't even like his books that much. they're all so aggressively confrontational. i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize.
that's true. oh, god, lotte, what have i become? my wife in a cage with a monkey. a gun in my hand. betrayal in my heart.
please tell me, jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  i don't have to tell you i'm afraid.
so how long have you known blade, anyway?
well she sure isn't normal.
trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? quit acting all squeezed out.
yah.
just fine, doc... in fact, i think i might've put on a couple of pounds since i got here.
yeah, jimmy?
yes. you're a girl who remembers her promises.
do you remember?
you like it?
what, sir?
i've never had orange whips, i'm from akron.
it's good.
that's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
sarah, it's roman, i'm sorry i'm running late, i'm still on the 405, i'm about 10 minutes away.
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
let us put it to the test. protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. i'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes -- not that i believe in him any more than i do in science.
this way.
i left early because i wasn't feeling very well.
yes i have, very hard.  has daddy called?
make it ten. i am only a poor corrupt official.
you bet, mom! coming up!
hey look-
god, you... you're mean.
biology.  she wanted to be a doctor.
that's what you said...
i need that voucher! i told you a week ago it was important!
fine.  but i'm bringing a couple of friends.
you do what you want.  you want to leave...you want to go kill yourself?
he loved her.
harriett...
yeah seems okay.
but what did you get on your sats?
i don't know.
yes.
so have i--i can get it right out of my trunk.
i was dying. i thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
why'd he do it?
you don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
ok, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
where are you-hoo?
manray better not be bleeding to death.  i need him.  after we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
i am captain renault, prefect of police.
hey, billy. watch the suit.
i'm doin' business here!

that's correct, doc ...

i'm sorry, neil.
absolutely.
you're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
int. u.s. research laboratory/corridor - night.

the sub-basement, huh?  great idea.
you didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
you've got it!
is that a poem?
got a good buy in soap, miz cooper.
how can you say that?  you know it's not true.
get on the other side of that.
please continue...
what?
he hates me.
the government knows. i cannot repeat it to you. but this thing goes deep, ed. this was not your wife. i goes deep, and involves the government. there is a great deal of fear. you know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. they try to limit it, and--
i'd call them excuses. and the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. and you know what? it's not.
i brought it to you in the hospital.
you'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
no. there's no way. i mean, don't you think there's no way?
you got to be crazy.
everybody'll sit still for somethin'. what did ya find out about the train, eddie?
thank you, your honor. further: ms. costello is a rebuttal witness. as a 'surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
nah.
what's plan b?
it does!
yes you are. you always do. it's why we broke up. you always hide behind him.
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. about our place in their colonization.
wasn't worth gettin' upset over a milky way.  anyways, i was never much for, ya know, discipline.
he cribbed that from borges.
two.

leo.  leo's twenty-eight, cal.

it doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
oh yes, of course - you've just been elected.
and vera niece, too.
you give up on her?
you're hesitating. i think that means you have.
the pimp-mobile?  just made a few after market modifications.  nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
why is that?
what do you believe in?
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer. anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. and again. until someone stopped him.
i want to see you, too.
you've used up your grant. the electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
did not.
we were probably in school together.  you went to berkley?
why?
hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
george bit you?
i think she's after glenn.  the girl still with you?
so he's going. uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
she went to the fight with herb shuttle, i guess.
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
yeah, it's such a perfect evening. isn't this how you've always pictured it?
just a whore, i go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. i'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
listen, nick --
her name was elizabeth.
nah, it's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing.  it didn't hurt at all.  it was just a yoga move.  i tucked my head in.
can't eat through a canvas bag.
too bad you're out of it.
yah, you bet. it's in the lot there. brand-new burnt umber ciera.
the phones are working?
what? what the fuck do you know about the third world? you been there? no? no, well, i have. fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. everything stinks. it's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. no nothing. the assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
maude, do you think you can help me?
you're getting a workout, you and captain forrest, your first night.
i do.
right behind you, t.j.
i think that thing is ben.
i ate.
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers?
paulie. why would i? i swear.
sure you do! no one reads!... listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
not you, my husband?
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  there's no way you're going back in!
there's the agency issue. i think koessler may suspect something already. we're not on the best footing with him as it is.
oh, shit.  take your time!  don't get suckered!  this man is a murderer!  in his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  please, just take the fall!
is it?
is morpheus alive?
i spose i'm drinking myself to sleep. it's helena's christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..

what about your friendly cop?
sam, if she's here...
not yet. not married.
you want to tell me what the hell's going on?
it's far better thing that i do... holly, you and i aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
you know everything, don't you?
okay.
i am.  you-you made my day.
look man, i just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  i didn't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. why?
sounds good. chart a course for the veil nebula.
i wanta get some things.
what is it?
that's correct.
a thousand feet.
i gotta get my tool --
yeh. er, and my boss, mr. schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man delaney—
i don't follow.
home it is.
i'm sorry... i can't hear you. i can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
you're getting warmer.
no, kevin --  that's the whole thing, that's what i've been realizing.  that nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
yeah, i know.
you needn't bother. i can't drag you further into this. after all, i am still the chief suspect.
you just ask them questions?
uh-uh.  how about you?  you seeing anyone?
it's all right. that part of your life is over with. right?
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe.  she also owns 50% of the profits.
i guess most people are.
yeah, i guess so.  what are you going to do now that you're home?
you want to know what it is?  what it's all about?  john.  chapter nine.  verse twenty-five.
why?
who did it? now wait a minute.
two point one seventy-six.
dad, why are you acting this way?  is this because of the other morning?
you'll be fine. dr. redfield just wants to give you some tests. you'll like him.
i so wish i'd known.
got in a little accident.
i'm the bowler.
what?
don't let him get you.  just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
i never left. where's my wife and daughter?
raise them --
wouldn't have known you.
what are you talking about? you can't marry osgood.
i always eat here.
but i will have it on my birthday, won't i?
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command? woody oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
i think it's a fucking good idea.
it's happening right now. i'm here at the atlantis. everything's fine except... i left my wallet at home.
you can be john malkovich.
but he'd have to. if he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
we're looking for him. in your opinion, why did frank kidnap dorothy's son and husband?
-- what he would do to your dad's department? you gotta let me finish it --
all right, wise guy. go ahead. spill it.
-- mulder! get in the car!
so did we.  i mean, sherlock here.

well, to tell you the truth, i'm having some trouble getting started–
yes.
i really don't have much of an appetite.
this isn't about you, scully. they're doing this to me.
i don't suppose i could have a little snack while i wait for the surprise?
you havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
right.  but there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  the sins are in a different order.
hands off the suit, monkey-boy. close your eyes if you're scared.
different.
no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's get in the back.  no one will see us there.
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
yeah. she's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
just gettin' rid of the garbage.
a tomb?  we're in a tomb?
what time is it?
it's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after i hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
i just figure the percentages. he wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
we've done studies.  we're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as chicago.
you wanted to share this moment with me.
you think it can go faster than an f- 36?
of course.
that's where they keep them.  you want me to bring the tooth out here?
mmm...
come on.  let me buy you something to eat.  looks like you could use the company.

you can still work.
i'll get it.
eleven thousand four hundred, cash. here in my pocket.
who's going to pay for all this, sheriff?
you got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
i think so.
the one who said he was dyle's brother -- of course i'm sure -- tex wrote the word 'dyle' before he died. he's the murderer i tell you -- he's the only one left! you've got to do something!
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
whereas you are.
well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  it is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  she is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
"i have more care to stay than will to go. come death, and welcome. juliet wills it so. how is't my soul? let's talk. it is not day."
he's your brother.

he was there with someone. so i suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. i'm going back to mongi. i think dickie's coming home.  i'm going to go home.
you can't just take it!
you think you could do that?
kara, no!
what's the matter, leo?  don't you like coney island?
what's this?
i said, yeah, about once a week!
it wouldn't be fair to her.
yeah.
the scar. which of you has it?
i hated myself.  i kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a zombie.
price. when i go i want you to give me five minutes. exactly five minutes to get dunbar out of that water tank. then you throw price out into the compound, nice and loud. he'll draw every light from every goon tower. it's our only chance to cut through. what do you say, barracks' chief?
all right -- roby and melkonis will go with faust.  hunter and i will make up the second team.
oh, robert, i'm sorry. we were so tired from the branding. grace barely made it to her bed and i didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
flip was a hero in vietnam.
yeah, steve. steve was all right for awhile.
i'll get undressed now. is that all right?
wouldn't want to keep vic waiting.
i work here, sir. i’m here most of the time.
pardon?
are you so superstitious?
yes -- but ...
go on -- out with you.
a spinal injury, in the line of duty. it was in kitty's report...
they're bad for you. they cause...red lips. 
okay.  i think i'd better be alone for a while.
he's right.
elizabeth! little elizabeth! why you're so... middle aged!
well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
say, look! i didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
passing through! you're so white. did you ever see a guy so white, marge? gray, actually.
what is it?
it's okay.
i thought, geez, is that margie olmstead? i can't believe it!
he was a friend of mine. a good guy...great guy. it was my fault.
normal.
because the past is immutable. frozen.  dead... and you are the past.
yeah, hey buzz.  let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  gimme five, man!
i helped.
no you're not.
helsinki, which is the capital of finland.
oh, they're watching all right. they're watching.
i'm not criticizing. _ did you two get any further?
no, no. see - they, no, see, they only deal with me. ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
oh, man, don't say that..
off a little alley with cobblestones.  hemingway went there...
then don't talk about killing.
well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
they're gone.
i know it's not the greatest.  it's commercial.
missionary?  penance?  you talk about it like it was a religion.
what gets me is i'm 46 years old. i've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
hey, ted.  c'mon in.  i wanna' talk to you.
no.  probably not.
that's a crackpot theory. everybody says so.
a nozh scrap any time you say. dim weakens.
yeah... not bad for a city college boy. bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...i just got on the board of the zoological society, cost me a million; that's the thing with wasps -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
but i hate cops, remember? except for her.
we don't.
what are you talking...
now, monsieur, you have no right...
shurrup, cheerful.
well, anyway, i know hildy's getting a good man.
that's crazy.  he's not going to kill us.
why me?
i'm the stenographer.
calm down and get in your position.
we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
what's that?
caesar ...
you have really soft hands. like a baby's.
getting used to it.
that's what i thought. so let me put it this way...
he works for mr. eddy.
sure... i'll see you around.
if you want to sell your service, i'm not willing to be the price... i loved him. you loved him. what good have we done him. look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
don't make fun of me when i'm being wonderful and supportive.  you belong on the court.  just like i belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
i want that brain.
despite you.
right. sorry.  do you think he did it? 
i'd like that.
the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. steer clear of them, mister worf...
we'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to fairbanks.
you know, you have to. sometimes you just have to, toby.
ooh-kay...
no, thanks.
listen, kirkhill.  i'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... i thought i'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  unless you have an objection.
five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. hard bondage, or course.  other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, i have only two stipulations.
are you really nineteen?
i ain't goin' to jail, and i ain't doin' that probation thing again.
i told him, get the important stuff, kim's ring.  i'll collect the inconsequentials.
yes, sir.
i don't blame you.  so we'd both fuck elvis. it's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
shut up, diego.  they're going to be here any minute.  i'm trying to concentrate.
yo, dobree!
scale the --
...i have never met a man who was so well beloved.
rich, comic book freaks.
huh? uh... yeah.
tell me something.  what becomes of young masbath?
but he had a spare d-6, you said. right there.  why not use that?
thorgan, pull us in.
i don't know.
have you been there?
i thought we were just having a conversation. you seem to be reading all this meaning into it. meanings i must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
you have to ask?
what'cha got, bennett?
i'm getting married tomorrow.
say it in english.
why were you drawing the holy mary?
well, i'll tell her i ran into you.
krieger.
i'd need a continuance. three weeks at least.
they don't send planes to put out machine guns.  two flank runners with surpressing fire.  i'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. it really is the curse of the sequel. the billy/stu thing’s been done.
invasion.
well, that was a monumental waste of time! i pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
a wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... there is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
no. myers is taking me.
betty sizemore. what do you mean you wrote it?
he's a boy, dude.
yeah i left him with the car... we're all squared up now.
it doesn't matter what i think.
i'll be there.
beats me.  city officials.  secret service.  dallas police.  they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before.  but they didn't bother running through dealey.  they stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
joe --?
it was self-defense.
i promise, dorothy. i promise.
are you all right?
i can keep going, i assure you. shall we try?
do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
i call it 'nutty' as my shit after i eat almond roca...
oh yeah.
when?
no more! you see? watch!
if money can buy what he wants.
they're what's keeping me alive. you think you're dealing with an idiot?  talk to me then.
i deeply regret this unfortunate incident. we try to remember we're a military organization.
quite a piece of plumbing.
no.
you nervous?  forget it.  the cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
black or regular?
no, he's gone.
it's left its mark still. the last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. take them into town. get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. it's good medicine.
beam them directly to sickbay.
it's alright, barton. you don't have to write actual scenes?
maybe he melted.
it's freddie. let me in.
if casanova suddenly ... turned out to be romeo ... having supper with juliet--who might become cleopatra ... how would you start?
he's going in!
your brother's here.
no, you can, you can.  you've been so nice to me.
right.
and how does an image like this help us to see that?
the thing is, can you go the distance?
well?
lovey...church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
you'll want a cocktail dress then.  turn.  you have a beautiful figure.  a little too out in the open but simply lovely.  size six? do you need shoes?
lester - he called you here.
my massacre at paris is complete.
i refuse to drive in this country. too many madmen.
fine.
oh, for god's sake...here.
and this has what to do with me?
then there's nothing i can do. he should've joined us when i gave him the chance..
with one of them.
they were all veterans.
i have had them since childhood.  i cannot remember what from.
sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
mr. dumbarton is, yes.
tell my son.  you have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
-- you know his name is frank.
you think it's funny, motherfucker?
roy? he's always crying.
that's carlotta valdes.
why not just buy your baby a night light?
michael's.
fuck you bitch.
excuse me, sir -- i understand you have eduard raban's file.
i wasn't sure, ken...
...work okay?
technothugs.
what did he say to you in french?
no cried?
where did you see that?
i have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
jake, what is that?
michael!
you don't understand.  if dylan falls asleep,then...
you don’t say.
i <u>tapped</u> you.
knew what?
someone's been murdered.  not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  torn limb from limb.  there's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
see what, dil?
and he didn't have them?
a young albanian girl, dressed in their...
hey, guys, i've always wanted to sing like franki valli and the other seasons, but come on....
everybody has a weakness.
scent glands.  insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
then you wear it.
must i administer them directly, or might i blow them?
wait a minute!
would you take these?  and if i die...  could you throw all my drugs out? paraphernalia, porno, you know... anything that would break my mom's heart.
let me get at that typewriter and i'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
sure.
i'll try, d-d-dammit! you can't ask any more than that!
look, i'm not saying you don't have a daughter. it's just that she's not my daughter.
nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
i did shave... do i seem hairy? peter laughs.
to have a good time with you until you have to go.
thelma kinda took to him.
kevin's fine. he had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. the dogs dug them up. tell me what you're doing.
excuse me?
fuck it's the cops. peter saw me, now i have to let him in.
they're ghosts.  they do what they want.
this is metropolis after hours! this is what you'll be writing about. c'mon, let's dance.
well, i flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. i wouldn't know anything about it.
i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
no, they couldn't. father was a doctor. the kind who placed ethics above collections. that speaks well for father but it always left us kind of--  could we get on with this, senator?
it's just somebody's idea of a joke...
maybe gregoire and the witch ate it.
very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  maybe he's lost interest.
yes it does.
oh, i wouldn't kid you . on the level, it actually happened. nobody bought a paper that day. they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
okay. goodbye, ellie.
i admire your valor, jack.  by all means, seek him out... but first, we needs visit the kitchen.
i'm sure.  when you've led the kind of life that i have, there are debts that must be paid.  maybe i can balance the scales a little.
whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
i don't need any advice from you! get me a doctor!
no, that's not a date, a date is when i don't cook.
the first thing we want to do is to cable the foreign office. all of england is waiting to hear about my brother. there's a cruiser at shanghai ready to take him back.
you almost married recently, didn't you?
life.
it's beautiful there.  your mother and i were there once, before you were born.
one point two million dollars? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
bobby's the only person i know who isn't -- jittery.
what's average?
i already have.
you can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
it's... i don't know.
go away, curtis. if you can't knock, i can't hear you.
dad, i...
he was my grandfather, too.
yeah?
come, come, sir.  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
innocence. legal innocence. i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
ah, the old and doddering.  i'm going to scourge their puny minds, reducing them to zombie's. and then i'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
you're a whiz kid. so perceptive, so --
i need to know what i'm working with; what their boundaries are. their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  we've got to bring them together.  make them a crew.  we're as strong as our weakest link and i don't want to find that out the hard way.  so, i will challenge them and they will come together.
oh yeah. dreams. sometimes durin' sickness. vision quest. sweat lodge. ya never know when.
did you see mr. marsh the day before his death?
oh, it's all right, beats jew york. but the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
why?!
he's a vegas entertainer.  i used to do impressions of him.  we sorta... got in a fight over that.
we'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
...bones ol' bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
pretty, ain't it? you a plumber?
whatever.
aye, aye, sir.
what?
oh, so what about her?
i didn't say i remembered killing him. i just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
i beg your pardon?
precisely. you give me the mask security code, i steal the mask, you get a finders fee. at ten percent, should be two or three million at least. not too bad.
don't do it, sam!
i can give you five. you didn't do very much to these.
what d'you mean?
gentlemen, i go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
jesus fucking christ, diego.  i ain't telling you.  it's just business.  now, shut up.  you're driving me crazy.
what happened to the baby?
it's working!  oh, doctor -- you play beautifully.
dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in l.a., for about twenty years.  look at my lp's. under 'autobahn.'
like he would find dignan. one day.
oh, yeah, i will...
that's it then.
i see.
nonsense. we came here to find the american dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. you must realize that we've found the main nerve.
they're empty, dr. weir. moving forward.
a visual record, yes.  a before-and- after kind of thing.  this could make your reputation.
broke is more like it.
profitable.
and they get caught!
he followed my birds into their coop. here, you want him?
wussup?
come on, try some.  take a bite.
there's something black in the green part of your eye.
they're afraid of you, aren't they?
why, i--
dave, you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it. now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. but i am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
good lord.  how'd you get it on tape?
i mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
my complication had a complication, but dr chapman says i'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. are you buying a christmas present for your mother?
tip was fine, jake. we were a little more curious about the fed.
i need to talk to you alone.
i think that’s disgusting.
what's it look like?
no. thank you. i'm in... a hurry. i just want to make a change and start...
any major operation is dangerous. however, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
it was a tough, uh... it was a long - she fought real hard, marge...
how do you know?
i've never met anyone like you.
homeless people?
make 'em throw strikes.
wha-at?
from the first time i saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected.
i hope he can prove it.  come on. you don't want to get pneumonia.
call me whatever you want.
it does doesn't it?
ok, ok. you guys just go back in. dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. go on.
say there's just one "mole" working there, like barton at the doj. how do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? or she? or the guy she works for?
they won't kill it....
i'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post oklahoma city. i hear you're an important figure in those circles. you have a lot of interesting ideas....
you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker, didn't you?
what?
alright, relax. 20 minutes. soon as we've passed tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
what the hell are you talking about?
yes, thanks.
well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  and i'm expecting you won't mention it again.  i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  what are you, his shadow?  do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  you know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with w.p.  that means without you.  okay, pal?  let's eat.
back on earth. victor's medical facility... we're in quarantine.
that's all there is.
let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. according to you, mr. blonde was gonna kill you. then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. that's your story? i'm correct about that, right?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
you bet i did.
why sure, luke. i mean i didn't talk to them about that. but why not? they're reasonable, luke. hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
hey!
he's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
a guy named brill. same guy as always.
i mean, what are you actually doing here? what is the hidden agenda?
there's no gang in there -- we were the last ones.
put him under the table or i'll stop her from coming in.
i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.
something like that. you?
neither does he. that's where he loses. this man's scared to death to go to court. we only have to call his bluff.
nope, we're assigned heah.
he'll live if that's what you mean. but somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
good news?
you can walk away.  we both can.
of course. food alright?
well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
she's in the holding cell, on this floor.
ah-hh, no.
i need to go now.
i'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. will you still think i'm cute if i'm huge?
no.
ben ... ben ...
look. you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. you're from the reservation. it's a different world.
cross was looking for her all over the country. offered rewards, everything. felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
nagger?
i know that's what you'd like us to believe.  but i got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. not to mention abduction.
bullshit.  you wanted me to kill her.
yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
--i'm woodward.
not all day.  i'll be home after lunch.
i'm saying it's luck. all luck. you work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. where does the ball bounce? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. he's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "pup corn."
listen to me, it's over.
stop kidding.  i want to know what happened.
okay, sounds good.
trick him.
he leave town?
oh, that. i'll let jenkins explain.
well i'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, i'm doing some work.
him?
the walkers loved sean.  he was their only child...the object of all their attention.  i mean, wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  that's his nature.  but risa, she's still got dreams.
that's mecklen. the deal's closing. i can pick that phone up and i can work this out.  you'll walk with me.
we just thought that—
a mistake... it was a mistake...
forget it, doll.  after all, you work here - i work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
mhravitch.
yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
very nice mitchell turns.
dr. bennett. it's good to see you.  my wife, josephine.
cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
now i don't want to! i bought all of your penguin crap. i thought i found her--the right one! and the problem was she was too young! no - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
she loved me.  she wanted to see me every night.
calm down, mister. you don't want to get the cops in here do you? you got a family?
huh?
you think she's gonna make it?
yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
i know it was you -- i know it was you, tom. i know it was you. i know you killed dickie. i know it was you.
we'll transplant it. to the forest.
kings are out of fashion. i'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  it's an anti-trust action.
four or five days.
romance!
in return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
don't tell me my business!  quarter-mile, that way. full throttle.
hey, don't laugh. everyone oughta have a friend like me !
is that what he tells you?
you did miss --
you have a great profile.
you saved me, scully.  as different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. i owe you so much, scully, and you owe me nothing.  i don't want to do this without you. i don't know if i can. if i quit now, they win.
but you will.
whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. later on.
you a lesbo?
yes, i suppose so.
yes.
where you think you are, boy? they probably never seen a olive in this country.
be happy.  he's good at this.
sure, cease.  they make us do stupid things, don't they.
all i know is--he said to me tonight-- "what does your wife think?" my wife. thinks we're married--
radar!
well, that's because he's the devil. and he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of hell, causing my dad...
what a surprise.
anna is an excellent swimmer. even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
go?
and there's will the english in the muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
of course i am.
giovanni.
okay.
jimmy, did you touch her?
nice of you to offer, jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. i'm sure sandy will be back soon.
do you want a cup of tea?
now, let's get rolling!
no.
you should try adderall.
it was you, juliet, it was you --
of course, yes. just what would you like to know, inspector?
okay: i...look: i'm going to make it worth your while.  i am.  i turned this thing around.  i closed the old stuff, i can do it again. i'm the one's going to close 'em. i am!  i am! 'cause i turned this thing a...i can do that, i can do anyth...last night.  i'm going to tell you, i was ready to do the dutch.  moss gets me, "do this, we'll get well..." why not.  big fuckin' deal.  i'm halfway hoping to get caught.  to put me out of my...  but it taught me something.  what it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  big deal.  so i wasn't cut out to be a thief.  i was cut out to be a salesman.  and now i'm back, and i got my balls back...and, you know, john, you have the advantage on me now: whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  we're going to make it right.
the wound is bleeding!
that's very kind of somebody. who do i have to thank?  what happens if i miss the train?
we'll convince them.
he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop. i've got a hunch something is up.
what, it's worse? you're pregnant with an asian design major's child?
stop this!
around here?  why would they?
yes!!!
as much as mother miriam does?
mmmm -- so can i...
come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody i worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  come on, pal...
that's the best idea i've heard in a long time.
i thought you didn't respect money!
that happens to be the truth.
i can't help wondering, jack, why you're being so helpful and all? last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
come on where? back to a one-room apartment that i can't pay for? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
no.  i mean.  not even your people should be involved.  right?  it's too close now.
you're happy to get a fine?
we'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  are you ready?
sell that. i figured it could only have painful associations for wash.
damn, i knew i forgot something.
agreed.
aw, no, ella.
i <u>know</u> my lines...
i see. and are you in touch with mrs. sizemore?
where are you going?
wait a minute. wait a minute. al, you leave my heart alone...
go to sleep ellen.
faith.
why?
"mumford"... i mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
yeah.  kidnapping.
he called me "doc."
do me a favor -- talk to gazzo. tell him i'm a friend an' would do a good job... tell him i ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... bustin' bones don't bother me -- tell him i'm a good worker.
great. i'll have a bloody mary and a steak sandwich.
satellites?
listen, darling. i want you to look once more. take as long as you want. look very carefully, and then i want you to tell me that no one's there.
this way, gentlemen. let's retire to my office, shall we?
well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. no, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
no -- no, i'm don't.
really?
to what? where did this ship go? where did you send it?
i ... uh ...
no, i think i'll drink it in here, thanks.
i know. anyway --
goodnight.
well, no, not exactly. see then his friend opened up on me.
aren't we all.
i just graduated from m.i.t. in engineering. that's when john mccay hired me.
and i never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- but this is serious -- big competition.
it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. could he swim?
sor-ry  we have to do something. he can't wake up half done.
gaston would never tell me. it was asubject not to be spoken of, captain.
he was watching me.
not for quincy mccall.
well, i don't get on so well most places.
i'm just being honest. i just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
this going to work?
we should take it with us to signal any planes.
cuter.
forsythe, forsythe! what's wrong? what's happened?
you know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
who gives a fuck what you think?
what's that mean?
what a question... because i want to be with you, naturally. i hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... isn't this water wonderful!
i think you know i'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
you.  your responsibility is over.  you do not fly.  you are not a pilot.  you are not a distributor.  you introduced us to mr. stevens and the use of his airplane.  that is all.  you make a percentage.  a generous one.  and you're lucky to get that.
i am the lord's voice in this town.
felt like a hydro concussion ... an imperial cruiser.
well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?

oh my god.
i didn't mean to make a fool of you.
i mean, you could have killed yourself.
i'll tell the cast ahead of time. what do you say?
well, well, well.
there is no public offering. the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo. 'wrote this just to run their web site.
i'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth's relationship?
we find that your subscription lapsed...
uh-huh.
well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at usc.
you're welcome.  but, i want you to do me one favor.
yeah.
"the blood tide".
i have to be somewhere.
maybe.
well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our white house payroll.
i wouldn't be so sure.
no, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
what is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
no. no, you don't.
i saw a monster. can i have a glass of water?
yeah. are you sure mommy's not home? it's very late.
i don't know what to say...

mr. cardenas, i suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
it was...  ...one of them!

eddie, you must have me confused with david selznick.  i don't make major motion pictures.  i make crap.
i thought the worst they would do is fire me. who knew they took termination so literally?
don't say please, fuckhead. what are these?
federal express for 'zavitz'.
yeah, hurry up.
if i could have a little more room.
no.  all you need is to want to be the best.
our...? oh!  he seems fine. i guess we woke him. the lights and all.
johnny friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.

i wish i could tell you i remembered something new, but i can't.
oh, buzz is pretty harmless, really --
i want the autopsy report, where is it, minnesota?
her tits!  her tits!  how, that she signed in her contract, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the actors studio? the way she played <u>medea</u>?...her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
i miss dad.
i think it's fantastic.
darlin', you ain't seein' santos again, are ya?

i never comped you?! i don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the tangiers?!
--and he's like "shit! motherfucker!" and he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- i'm sorry--
third group.
see, i was the opposite. i never understood why anyone would want to go into space. it's so dangerous. you do one thing wrong and you're dead. the astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. and truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
she likes old movies like i do, that's all.  besides, she doesn't really know me. she thinks she does, but she doesn't. maybe it's because she's mormon and i'm catholic.
yeah. me and a friend of mine. he's outside.
i have told the truth.
you sayin' you'll do what?
we made a mistake.  let's not make it worse.

i pack up and go somewhere else.
andy?

what's to like?
rocky!  the ramp!

i wasn't singing to myself.
oh george, this is bob zmuda.  bob and i have been buddies for years.
madam ... cut to woman turning, half in flirtatious conversation. it is sam's mother, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of sam's dream girl.

i'm going to get the real murderer. i've got an idea.  want to see me take him?
the wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
can i--uh--help you gentlemen?
but she's standing right next to you.
don't worry about it.
i'm going to throw up.
she's very successful.
pretty messy.  parents have already been notified.  our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
and the second time around...?
yeah, birds. all they do is make a mess of everything. who needs them?
that's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
constantly! i'd say three times a week. like the other night, alvy wanted to have sex.
i thought the movie was bitchin'.

get out of our way, mr. secretary. the navy has been running blockades since the days of john paul jones.
why did you say she might be hiding from me? did she say anything to you about me?
i think the point is to make us dispair... to see our selves as... animal and ugly... to reject the possibillity that god could love us.
would you like to come out tonight?
we're hooked. hove into position.
you reached down into death. now, isn't that right?
ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  and the scenery has definitely improved.

this one has been so hyped. we're tied for most wins with northglen north. this year's winner will determine the winner of the century. the theme is everything. so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique--
hang it up, she's on her way. you gotta listen to this. this involves you.
you're psyched. you need to lay off of that shit.
i don't trust you. no way! i pick who goes! and i'm holding you responsible.
you go to the council fire. i'm going back in.
how do i know?
lee, you okay?
i'm sorry i hurt your arm.
and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.
that was a pretty good escape act at the station.  how did you do that?
i'm sorry, i'm just surprised to see you. i didn't think... what do you want?
you girls are in some hot water.
and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us, i'd be an architect now.
because they said it couldn't be done.
good. i'm glad that's settled!
two days.  an hour or so.
alright.
fine.  i'll tell her.
yeah?  who is this?
and judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
how about a big mac?
i missed you.  i wondered if you were ever coming back.
you're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? she's ly-ing.
it's a changing time. sit down, son.
i came up here after kevin's father died.  they were very supportive and helped me adjust. i got myself together. i've gotten myself together now, too.
i just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
who did?
c'mon, chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. i'm not taking notes ..
no sense in going up there! i been here for hours. he ain't here!
how?
dance with me?
what'd the devil give you for your soul, tommy?
no, but as i say, the type is rare. ten percent of caucasian males.
o.k. o.k. without the bird seed. what do you want?
it's spelled different, but basically... now you said it twice; just one more time, and i'll be free.  and then <u>you'll</u> be free.
yes.
no reason.
keep it tonight.  we'll catch fish. i'll see ya back on the docks...
really? please?
i'll do it!  sure as there's shit in the tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
seven --  -- queen.
i know.  it's for the baby's crib.
v'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. and make no graven image of the lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. because he's not like anything. not only can't you see him or hear him, you can't even think about him. i mean, what's the difference between that and him not existing?
is this how you get off or something? taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
gino, your son stole this money to set me up and i can prove it.  violet!
yeah.
do you wanna make things easier on me?  now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  you can say anything to me, i hope you still know that.
what makes you think i'd go for that bet? that's a seventy thousand dollar car.
don't blame yourself, you did what i told you to do.
but you need a man right now. it wouldn't be fair to you to --
what's a fascist?
there was a transfer.
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being, i would make peace with all.  i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. and rage the likes of which you would not believe. if i cannot satisfy the one, i will demonically indulge the other. that choice is yours.  you're the one who set this in motion, frankenstein.
where are we going?
i'm not a real batter.  i'm a woman.
quiet please.
fuck that!  i love you, walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  i've got a ghastly headache, actually.
forget it.  i've got a scholarship to harvard hanging over my head.  i won't risk it.
no kiddin'?
oh, down the ... er ...?
to pay for the next expedition, of course.
they look like they're jumping.
i don't care, philip.  you want to go chasing barbara zelman, go ahead.  just watch out for those buck teeth.
you're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry.'
well stocked.
it's ... lovely.
what is that?
well, i can't yell "oh, butler," can i? maybe somebody's name is butler...
the thing with dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
you have no right...
mom, can't you tell him that i'm sick?
no, no! you don't understand, i love you! it's real love and i can't help it! please kiss me, mr. hillyer, i love you, i love you so much...
your husband is a coward. he sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
pretty terrible shot.
come on down to the plant.  it's state of the art.  we're doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business.
well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
okay?
well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, david, maybe i'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
rain.
you know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
so will you, someday.
who gets contaminated, the jews or the gentiles?
never mind -  bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  well, charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  he entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
why? come on, julie. think. you'll get it. will benson -- ben's son.
i was hoping you could tell me.
mr. gazzo wants the two hundred now!
you don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
no, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
uh.  well.  maybe you could give polo a hand going in....
i hope to score big there myself. i'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
what about my money?
these chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
get your goddamn--
in the meantime, why don't you find something useful for dr. bright to do.
yeah? ain't that something? middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. only in l.a.
yeah, sure i do. why?
but i reel guilty. it doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with jacqueline gone.
on brean, who is doodling.
no...
yes!  it was...it was unforgettable.
you'll tell me more tomorrow?
i'm not like you.
how old?
jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
i don't want anything.  i'm just a really big, big fan.  i've seen all your movies.
it's compensation, leo, for the marginal life we lead.  sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
my father was an electrician. already forgot that?
i'm not very good at it.
erin, it's just a meeting.
the girls will grow up.  they only know you from television anyway.
these ain't strangers, they're neighbors. this only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
i have sincere eyes.
look over there.
i want you to stay, okay? i goddam invited you, didn't i?
clean. real clean.  as clean as my conscience.
you saw me standing alone ...
come on in.
they must have clobbered some of our cities already!
i'll take you to the bridge.
watch it, dipshit. you wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
don’t tempt me. the last scumbag who thought i might kill him died soon afterwards.
'81, i think.  she tried again five years ago.  i thought you should know.
okay, matt.
how d'you mean?
mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. the guy you yelled at for no good reason...
i don't know. she's really been stressing out.
what?  who the hell are you?
readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. i've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. these drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  you seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. you got somethin' wrong with ye?
we were just talking about him.
talked him out of it. he thinks we're going to stay a week. i'll have to think of something before morning.
no dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
i just want to make sure i'm not breaking the law.
how many onions does it say to use?
trust me, he's already here. get going!
i should maybe go to the bathroom.
what happened?
the report didn't mention nails and eyes.
no -- absolutely not --
who knows?  it worked.
that is of no interest.
xxxxxx
ah.  then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  so if you'll excuse me ...
talk away, lady of my dreams. i'm all ears.
could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
there's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
anyway, last time i checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  and i know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so i'm just saying.
sir, yes, sir !
maybe! is it impossible?
-- we needed cohesion to move forward. not conjecture.
i gave it to berthier... this afternoon.
it's taken care of.
i'm not wrong.
and brenda?
look at him go. bam! bam!
i don't know. few munce.
i ain't escaping! we're picking up the new super just like i told you.
are you the one who left that note?
i couldn't stop eating steak. i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. i couldn't get enough. and then gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
no juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. but we might be able to adapt --
simon.
they've hypnotized the nation.
what does that mean?
i don't know, dignan. i just --
they must be the right people. whoa, there goes the hot dog man. let's get a couple. damn, that smells good. nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
how often is your wife called to help delivery?
excuse me.
well, it is to me.  will you give her a message?  i'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
they're drifting toward me... i think they're magnetic!...
so you found mary?
enough to keep sane.
fifteen for a straight delivery. twenty with the provision of a safe place. visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
i know.  hey nadia.
no buts! accept what's done, louis. what we done was right. another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least i hope to christ it was. now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
i've seen the manuscript.
where are you, ol' buddy?
well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
my wife.
something like that. but i'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
then let him. what have we got to lose, you and i?
i don't have one. i don't believe in them.
yep.
from now on it's e-v-i-l, no exceptions!
who?
the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, mrs de moraes.
i'll help ya.
about what?
you know how long i've been begging to take you on the wine tour. i was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
regulations?  these guys don't even give you sick leave.  how much you pull down on a good night?
oh, my god!  i can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
he didn't make a pass at me! i told you a million times!
you mean you bring other girls up here?
yeah.
and frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  it be magic, jack... powerful ogre's magic.
i still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops.
i'll have to think about it. i don't know about them. i do know one thing, we've got a lot invested in you. we'd hate to lose it. even more than those other guys, naval aviation needs a very few, very good men.
lou sklaroff, vin badalato, dave montell.
certainly.  tell me, bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
are you absol...
well, you gotta understand it. he doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
just a crank making phone calls. happens a dozen times a day at the office.
with the tenors.
oh, serious questions tonight.  of course i love you.
really?  um... i... well... you're really turning me around here,
for instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
yes.
who?
accident.
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary.
twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
ain't your fault -- here's the problem.
bye!
unwelcome?  i guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
did you get a doctor?
no ... just keep him in here.
well ...
it's saturday.
i hope so, too.
no, please.  i shall be absolutely fine. they pass almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
this way?
charles...
no, that's okay, i'll do it now.
top pocket...  go on.
sure.  just a minute.
it's a long walk.
let's find you a drink.
what?
i guess it must.
he has?
you love her, don't you, max?
we had an off night, that's all.
so, he knows where you are. that means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
scream.
sam! no!
i don't know, make some money, have some kids, you know.
-- just --
i told you you're not supposed to come in here.
sometimes.
no. all he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
that's right.  what's she doing?
isn't that always the way?
who else?
i can't know what i said, but we're not going.
put a tap on her phone.
shit ben! how the shit are ya?
yeah, right, i'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... do you know the cook's chicken franchise?
the jaguar's out front. you didn't even bother to put it around back.
c'mon follow me.
no! it's you, loki! i should never have listened to you!
but she expects you to marry her?
maybe we should sit.
i'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
looking... good, partner.  hang in there.
about half of them. a lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
cut it out, susan.  you and i've got to talk.  big day tomorrow, everybody.  joe, let's go.
oh please!...i was born a catholic in brooklyn... i've been to hell and back.... i'll be fine...  ....thanks...you're a gem.
it was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. it was the pale shadow of killing.
what?
oh, it's not my radio, sir.  i picked it up in the communications center.
i'm an evolutionary biologist.  what do you do?
shit... shit... what shit?
i'm a good boy, but no one listens to what i say.
dad's like doing his up with people routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
you're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
fine.  i'm fine.
three months.  we learn quickly.  we adapt.  it is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
some loyalty.
i got bored so i went to the movies.
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
gee... what makes you say that?
is that what i think it is?
amazing. i'm very impressed.
i like to watch.
oh, jack.  -- don't forget your lucky deck.
you weren't so bad yourself.
i take it back. you're not a cop any more. you're a store detective.
duncan...  duncan, i promised you an answer. you have complimented me with your persistence and patience... but the decision i've come to is i'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
these chairs are in good condition. with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
sit down. i don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
i'll see what i can do. how do i get in touch with you?
just below ten thousand.
i've got a year.  or a second. i'm not sure which.
well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
you lie, motherfucker...
no. i'll take the other one.  right. well it's good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.
--cotter's--
no, but i work there--i like it. my dad's a lobsterman.
jim, i won't stand for it.
ouch. now that's hot. she's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. let me know when you're done with her. this is my type of chick.
go ask him, why don't you ? ask him yourself.
getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
this isn't happening.
she was... she was on the bed.  she was just sitting on the bed.
a mansch -- a human being! so you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
let go of me! let go of me!
1959.
you're sweet.
he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick.
yes...
you send them.  is that it, max?
we're going to have jackets, aren't we?
i had a fight up at sportsman's.
did you like her to watch?
i'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
beth, stop it!
i'm ready for a complicated man.
yes.
are you okay?
on my knife.
so man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
it's better than a good sale.  it's a...
well...i guess they did get a little carried away.
peugot convertible ...
there are two of them. couldn't make them out. the orange glow of a cigarette.
hi.
let me tell you something about love.  there are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  love is hard work.
that dazzling imagination.
i think you gave me too much time, captain.
i deserve better than this.
use the phone, bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  where's your other shoe? never mind!  i don't want to know. some fantastic adventure, right? something really crazy.
stop eyeballing me, mayo, or you're out!
don't look like nothing.
daddy, wait.
but how could he know... unless...
no, man, nothing is fucked here--
i'm coming with you.
...ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
i deserve to help you.  don't you see how much this means?  my father... he... he was a good man...
what?...
pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
you've got all the answers. what about when they find the body on the train?
yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. anyone not ready for this?
i know.  you're neo.  be right with you.
anya! what if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
i don't doubt your talent. you looking for that place in the hall of fame?
it's nothing.
we just talked.
i can get into the den.  the office is right across the hall.
i tell you what's cooking.  she made the blind see and it was a gift!  who was it from?  let's hear an 'f" for...
i just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
yes, you can.
karl!!
i came specially to meet you today. i love your playing, but what a day to choose.
nothing, i guess…
sure.
telly is at steven's?
what?
all the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  kent, i bet you didn't know i won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
neither did i.
check with your son’s bank. banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
it tastes different.
not bad.  i just won the state lottery.
maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
you want my partner to kiss your ass?
you make it up, but it has to be believable.  they call it suspension of disbelief.
yes...
we're not in the middle ages, sister.
i just have to say, i can't respect any man who's never seen "green acres."
honey...
why?
well, you're doing something wrong, mrs. sutphin. i'd recommend therapy for your son.  thank you for taking the time to come to pta.
you would.
what are you talking about?
his name is john book.
yes, yes--the air--  --i'm getting plenty of air.  miss marsh--mrs. rosson.
to kill your wife.
what's botherin' you, anyway?
hi. how are you doing?
a ticking bomb...
what's that supposed to mean?
i know that.  i'm warped... i'm warped!
- and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were.
thanks
bull.
hey!
how much?
answer me, tyler.
read the papers!  half the country's doing it!
why not? half the house!
who's going to pay me then?
no. tell me why.
a visitor.
i'm staying.  don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; sonny never listened to me about that.  now, explain everything to me.
jason...
yeah.
it's been hell.
you have no right! you have no fucking right, you bastards! get the hell out of here --
it means, if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
eddie, if i wanted to make love with you again, i'd do it sober.
true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?
i did not conduct at at the rally, i conducted on the evening before the rally.
...yeah, but the hosaka's history.
some americans?
that's big of you, bob.
i might as well stay in there. i won't be able to sleep anyway.
blue five, does that glare bother you?
you don't seem like a daddy. you seem like a brother.  wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
i'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
i don't believe in luck. i know what conrad was like. don't tell me what you think i want to hear.
you know what the difference is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  okay?  there's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in yankee stadium!
you're a lawyer. don't you care what's going on around you?
o.k., o.k., that's enough.
good boy.  call us if you need anything.
is he here? are you with dickie?
i'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
hey.
in that case... no...
exactly --
i didn't know you were going with him.
is it real?
yes. good was done this .....
i wasn't hitting on your girl!
he sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
do you want to have some breakfast?
i just wanted to congratulate you. you did it.  you've created a world without murder.  so what if you had to kill someone to do it.
huh?
you should have helped her without being asked.
well, i haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
no hay de que. tengo otra. [no problem, i've got another.]
my liege,  i am honored.
i don't give a shit, qualen!  i had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  they beat us.  a couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
they're for my bodyguard.  i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
not here tonight. wasn't here last night. he's especially not back in his office.
then just wait.  i'm counting this all out and deducting my share. while i'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  and her little girl.
i was trying to save you. they were going to vaporize you.
greenbank?
yeah, i hit a three at the buzzer.
our next move?  i'll say one thing, louise.  this is some vacation.  i sure am having a good time.  this is real fun.
well, then you know what i'm talking about. anyway, here's the story. i scored with these two chicks. true story.
i don't know. you going to lock the video store?
charley... . charley... . wow... .
copy. and lundegaard too.
that's when you've got to fight them. that's when you've got to make them. that's -
no, what?
maybe i'm not going to keep you here.  maybe i'm gonna blow your brains out.
moonby, 4th battalion, royal australian regiment, task force. ex-corporal moonby, deserted.
same thing, isn't it?
but we did want you. it's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. we knew you needed a real mom and dad.
nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. now what would you do.
don?. where is he?
you're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
the "now i get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  that list.
ok.  he asks about you all the time. it's been weeks since you've seen him.
he won't move.
i got dry cleaning.
eh?
i haven't seen him in two years.
don't mention me.
"he ain't wrong."  listen, i know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. full-time.  and this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>that's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
chad--lother's on the boat, and i'm worried sick about sally--
let's go home.
nothing. i mean, nothing. i try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
'have a look?
where's what?
'it was so ugly...it was so big....'
he's a fine boy, mrs. benson.
don't worry. he's o.k. we sent him home hours ago. jeez, what a story.
how should <u>i know</u>?
we'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  as far as money goes... can i make a suggestion?  you say you were mugged?
yes.
ahhh. good choice, sir.
--oh, jesus--
but there's more?
jesus christ, homey, you are nuts.
ah, doctors. what's he gonna tell me?  can't trade my head in for a new one.
that's news to me.  so it's over at jesse's office?
that isn't necessary.
it's alright, it's cool...
that was cassius!
you try it.
in a little while i'll help you understand.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
she isn't my cousin.
don't worry about it. you listening to me? now, come on. we gotta go see paulie.
oh, really?
you're going to the office?!
a natural athlete can play any sport. any sport.
why did you lie to me?
on my way.
check it out.
i don't know what has happened to prince joseph.
how many of our class left? you and me out of twenty-eight.
the police department at merritsville. they called to report. the trunk was just picked up -- by mrs. anna thorwald.
why didn't you do something?
oh no. no way. i've had all the bad news i can take for one day.
she was a crossbreed, chinese and polish.
oh, no -- no!
you can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
which one?
why, somebody's complaining?
only one you've never broken.
but why draw it on the wall?
d'accord...  merci.  un moment -- un moment --
monsieur andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  and guess what else?
no! i keep thinking it'll go away. but there's this -- connection. she's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. plus i see her every day, we're working on the same program. she's -- beautiful.
so you see, i'm not going anywhere.  unless it's upstairs with you ...
you're not selfish at all.
who, me? why should it?
something. someone.
okay, i understand.  i'll boil it down for ya.  fuck nike.  all they do is ignore me...
for them. but for me --
we musta written what, twenty of 'em? and they were before this guy. one, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth --
350 miles.
no.  not that i can recall.
did you... kill him?
you didn't answer my first question. for whom?
you can't take anything seriously.
what, you think i'm made of money?
in the sequel, james, two lady scientists should make a monster. and our monster would be gary cooper.
jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! we're not interested in selling.
all the time. they're everywhere.  you won't tell anyone my secret, right?
let him break - he likes to break.
you going today?
what is?
i told you --
hi, linda. ..
no.
well you know what i mean.
i hope there's a place to land.
what?
thank you.  thank you very much.
insane.
cool.
hey, i spent all my money on those caramels.
yes, yes - go on. the voca me. suddenly sotto voce. write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. voca me cum benedictis. call me among the blessed.
very good, doctor.  i've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
but you're not out of the woods yet, baxter -- because most of them try it again!  you know where i am if you need me.
yes, i said it. sure, i said it. i didn't say it for publication, however.
you're the waterfront specialist. find out about it.  i've got a murder to investigate.
i don't think i was.
there was an accident.  a fucking car accident.  all of a sudden. boom.  jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
me too.
agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, ma.  we just don't pretend we know.
don't know.  ask around.  i'll be back.
george?
yeah. fuckin' christmas.
you take things too seriously. look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. we've got a good job here.
what he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  where is the fbi's vaunted initiative, where..?
well, not just one wish. a whole hatful, mary. i know what i'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. i'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and i'm going to see the world. italy, greece, the parthenon, the colosseum. then i'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then i'm going to build things. i'm gonna build air fields. i'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. i'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
how ya feeling?
tell me that!  tell me that!
same thing happened to me with wife two.  i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty.  i mean empty.  she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  what kind of person would think of that?
teresa.
yes...  could you please give this to enzo.
why?
it's really that bad?
'drugged' is a stupid word.
its true, sheriff.
she's just not the girl for me.
is the war worth it?  is it worth a one-term presidency?  because i think right now that's what we're looking at.
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling?
isn't there an easier way?
you'd better be.
well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
your superiors are two days away!
you scare me, charlie.
yes.
and if it so happens that you're wrong? if it just so happens that i could care less about you?
come on boys, don't be shy.
thanks, basil. maybe the nineties aren't so bad after all.
blow out the candles!
i dunno, duke. i kinda liked it.
i know about alcohol, john.
you weren't in the state legislature.
can i have an evil twin?
that is none of our business.  but you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
ain't no way, man, security's too tight. the big iron?
you could. it'd be a waste of your time, though.
about an hour ago.  said he was more than happy to cooperate.
another hero's hand-me-down... thurgis, note the armor; tis greek work.
now that's what i call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
nope.
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
that's what he is... baaaa!
i'm adjusting okay.
the man across the street.  i've seen him before...
it doesn't neccessarily matter. they don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
alice...
alone?
little red riding hood.
sure, snake. no problem.  you gonna kill me?
your pocket?
i don't know.  i think so.
it was a ford, benjamin.
you deserve a lot better. and i'll tell you what we'll do. stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen i'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in washington.
i'll look for it.
no.  she was mindless but not like miss jessica.  but the houngan cured her.
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
is this a contract violation, mr. cobb?
i'll say as little as possible.
just a routine inspection tour.
he was never able to reproduce them.
i think you have the wrong number.
you don't think weapons are important?
we'll talk another time, karen.  all right?  i'd like to know why foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
well, let's see... first of all, you fuck pigs.
you mind if i come in, check things?
do you work tomorrow?
remember, everyone! only two weeks until your science projects are due.
you mean, no prints but hers?
thank you.
where'd you get this?
mr. scott, the word is given.
but sir! federation starship approaching.
why the fuck would i do that?
blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
it means you'd better get some rest. we'll be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning.  the trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major.  now go on!
twice. without her sensing anything?
yeah?
but, indy --
no, ma'am.
"j".
razor and blade! they're flakes!
do you know who was brought in for questioning?
i think better when i drive.
as real as any memory in your head.
don juanism is just a cover... i've been reading up on it.  i'm a fake, i'm a fraud, i've been living a lie!
no, bennie: lumbago.
i can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
'kay, mac!
got a little lucky.
this week anyhow.
is very angry.
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  can you tell us what she's saying?
when'd you quit smoking?
stop calling me vernon.
i can handle it.
i thought you'd heard a trillion times --
things change. now i'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
uh. i'm showing off.
with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
now look, you mustn't talk like that. i won't get my wings with that attitude. you just don't know all that you've done. if it hadn't been for you . . .
you, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
i live in my car. this is my workshop.
okay.
no, i'm the king of the world.
i won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
how embarrassing.  did i hold up three fingers?
i don't know who fingered me, but i'm not a communist!
"my dear"...
this is some boat.  your father's?
that's astonishing. sera, look...
he said not to tell.
you're back!
how about straightening up the living room?
ssshh!
no thanks, i'll do it. give yourself twenty dollars. underhill.
yeah. bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
no, you did it yourself. maybe in your sleep.
i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long.  they all knew you at that place.
jim...
that fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
i wouldn't mind doin' something else, but i do really have to pee.
bye, bye.
it is no trickery.
i want to see stew smith. oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith.
gee, i used every frame of film we shot.  maybe they won't notice.
where?
julie dwyer died.
i can't --
hey, girl! hey, you, give us another drink!  dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
what "plans?"  you and mom got "plans?"
i'm pregnant.
yeah.
that's what they get for not locking the door.
couple months before i was born--
we need some towels, lou.  we need replacement light bulbs.
dunno.  just have this feeling today...
i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know. just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
reagan didn't die.  if he had died, everybody would know what johnny's middle name was.
your poker's improved a lot, hildy. lend me two bucks, will you?
let's review these notes for your testimony. we have a big day on monday.
are you giving me an ultimatum, lou?
the fuck i'm not.  i don't care what the doctor says --
surf's up.
dr. loomis, thank god you're here.  you heard her, didn't you?  it was jamie.
why not me?
yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
no.
not me. i'm not drinking.
one week old.
i'll remember that.
that was me.
'love will find out the way'?
does that bother you, bill?  i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
figured you did.
rick's got an important announcement to make.
i'll give you a lift, son. too hot to be walking... people die out here, y'know.
he's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
sure. i love venice.
only fry you once.
dela, kiss my big black ass.
barks his agreement.
that's the key question.
i guess i had it coming.  let's call it settled.
jesus, you know what? this shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
don't you get along with your parents?
that's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  both up with the chickens.
it's for your own protection.
okay, boy wonder, what?
will the cruise set it off?
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
could be raining!
well, i don't vouch for him.
willful creature, that one...
i remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  and that's all.  i guess i was unconscious after that. that's all.  then i was in the hospital.
it strikes me that eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
how am i going to conduct an interview if i can't ask him any questions?
i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
no? then what?
how did you find out?
anything else you want to add before i talk to her?
fuck you. you a hoto.
breathtaking.
i counted four.
i want that ship.
inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  all parts intact.
yeah.
doesn't need to be. use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes, stick out a thumb. you'll get picked up.  right?
that's good.
what did you say your name is?
is julia going with you?
i been thinking about how much i hate you.
i understand.
i've been taking it. i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. you know, abuse her. psychologically.
no, annie, no.  this is doctor bean. he's going to be working with us.
i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, bacon . . . it won't win. so where is ed with all the bright ideas?
well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
i only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but marguerite could not help me.  nor julien...
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
dick.
you can help her.
you took her because she helped me.
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years?
it is too late. he has drunk.
but it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
why...that sometimes dead is better. that's all. sometimes dead is better.
we have to go back!
yes, sir. i'll brace myself.
cut out all this clever talk about milicents. just because the police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. there was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. some very extreme nastiness, yes. a few of a certain billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. certain friends of yours were named also. oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but i'm warning you, little alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. deltoid makes a grab for alex's joint but finds his hand instead. alex laughs. derisively and rises. deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. he drinks from the glass. the clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
because, right about now, the h.m.s. dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
hey, here's esther williams.
i get it. you can drop it now.
and what of these foreigners?
you'll never change -- will you?
i know this sounds insane ellen, but... telling you all of this, writing the book... it feels good. don't get me wrong - i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... when i tell you what i have done - i can't believe it is me...yet i know it was. this is like a purging for me...
i'll make it an even five hundred. plus an extra hundred if you get me to lax on time.
check the immediate area.
look, he's there, and you're here.
tight. but i'm working on him.
you promised, tommy.
you can sleep tomorrow... come on...
oh, it must be two weeks. yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
peter, please...
meet me at three.
... you've become quite a close friend of eve's - haven't you mr...  ... chance...?
number five with a bullet.
don't be a fool.  one can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as i say. as for me, i'll tend to gray.
he just came up screaming.
look, you stay away from the mayor.  next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  you read me?
who?
just a second.  those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, i suppose?
oh, lots of things, i suppose. bad people for one. people who wanted to imprison them. hurt them.
i was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our mister duffy.
and all the angels are built like lieutenant dish.
i don't know anymore.
that's about all i ever eat.
i knew she had it.
go away.
yeah, very funny.
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate.
gold. you were going to—
isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? and all else may grow in time...?
with what?
last night. 7:30. big cup. i kept calling you, but i only got your machine. i don't even know your parents line and i was really worried.
not sorry enough.
no.
i don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
you're supposed to be in vegas. we have a suite at the flamingo. i was just about to leave for the airport.
that's it? -- completely?
there's more than one kind?
hours.  i've been so scared...!
i'm on a leave of absence. forced vacation.
when is it?
what?
who—me?  want to see me?
about 22 hours on site.
hey.
it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.
have you got a pen?
this is really awkward...
much too late.
it is.  go on, mr. thatcher -
then let's get started... it's senseless to waste any more time.
that's because you can hardly see through those things.
pleasure.  very nice to meet you.
everybody just shut up!
i've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
shit and fried eggs.
say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. putty - just putty, that's me.  now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if i kind of got closer so i could see them?
you have a map.
least he never called me that. with me, it was always "high-strung." "my bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." or "tightly wound," that was another one. you seeing anyone?
monica, what did you do?
well, she...
really?
you wanna take the chance, casper?
i suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. you know, jayne mansfield, james dean, albert camus...
i wish i could do more but we're moving out.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
you got it.
you may have known my father, william starks.
i'm a gambler -- i'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, i really belong in jail
it's possible.  why?
how is he?
i waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
when's your birthday?
a spacecraft. i saw the creatures. they led big dave onto the craft. he never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. of course he told *me*. no one else.
i got an interesting call this afternoon. it was from a dr. frankel.
a little longer for me.
please leave.
what!?  what are you talking about?  why should i help you?
he's a resourceful guy, your boss. how long you work for him?
yes.
look at these, will ya? i don't believe it. jesus, these are fantastic. look, here's my dad ... and here's my brother, when we were down in florida.
please!! no!!!
yes, i'm afraid i did.
i suppose i did.
you make any sandwiches?
why?
these burns.  my arms.  ouch...
ready?
that didn't sound like thunder.
what is that?
keep it down, dude.
fuck!!! that is so bullshit!
we'll get you out in ten minutes.
so...?
come on, man. don't shut me out. i'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
maybe it had something to do.
you think it's a conspiracy?
watch him close.  ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
... what?
sphinx brand.  when i got out of weapons design, i wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  i was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  and i thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  in fact i think i'll have one now.  care to join me?
what was your idea elijah?
yes. i can do "swanee river." would you like to hear me?
after you, doll.
i merely write the stuff.  you're the one that serves it up.
ever see one of these before?
...how do you know? you wish...
look, i...
no -- it isn't.  a cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  i want some answers, nash.
not "whatever."  it's two different things.
jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
how did bill react to the leads you've developed?
what's that mean?
--christ, they find out i let you have it for the weekend--
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
no one would have thought it of me. i've been getting rusty in fredersdorf. well, if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone. from now on... 
does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
we all have a past. you have a past, i have a past. and my past is no worse than yours. but you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
i said: don't look.
we've been talking about her, mostly.
please don't talk like that. you're upset. i'm not helping you. i'm sorry for what i did. i better go.
whatever.
huh?  what?
only at the very end.
yeah -- sure.  it's a real boy scout flashlight.
oh, god, uniforms, more stress. let her sleep.  it's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  we know, don't we, princess?  give her a couple of hours.  i know about this.
what book?
there was an unavoidable delay.
i couldn't wait two weeks! she's gettin' married tomorra!
..."a boy named sue". i think that's why he's such a bad cat.
that's ridiculous...
what's the bad news?
andy would go for this, don't you think?... firing squad, definitely.
she's willing to fly anywhere.
keep talkin'.  i like hearin'.
what?
it's not the same guy.  it should be a self-solver.  no bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  the others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  this one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, dui, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  sexually assaulted.  the others weren't molested that way.  we're waiting for the sperm tests...
i got beat up. they...  they broke my thumbs.
that's charity. she's out back. she'll be free in half hour.
and what, exactly, is your relationship to mrs. ryan?
i respect your business, mister tony. every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  it's right this that makes me nervous, now.  i hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
sam, let's go get married.
oh.
fantastic.  out here.
precisely. are you a good shot?
where do i pull off...?
no. unlucky. i have not been lucky.
but could i just tell you this one thing?
there's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  it's not just about opening up your pores, know what i mean?  there's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  settles me in a way that i really can't articulate.
possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about viktor?
i live with it every minute of every day.
my dog, archie... i woke up with flea bites... creepy. i ran out and bought flea collars. they work really well.
because it pays off.
i'm the emancipated type. real emancipated.
i'm moved beyond words.
he was the orderly, during dr. lechter's stay in prison.
hell. ten?
i got things to do.
i didn't know you had one.
fear ...
youddon't think i'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, major?
not too quickly.
may i see that?
no.  he didn't say what his name was. only that you were expecting him.
it means i'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
i love you.
i'm fine, i'm fine, i was scared, i thought you, are you okay?!
bullshit the thirtieth, i don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  i need the leads.  i need them now.  or i'm gone, and you're going to miss me, john, i swear to you.
as in daughter of agamemnon?
i have to shoot.
you feel you know me.
you're sick. you should go to the nurse. i'm going to tell miss dennis.
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
within your time, buster. lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
look, you could come up.  or you could wait if you want.  i could go check it out.  you could wait.
why don't you come back with me?
i thought you were my mother.
the kid's right.
that's where my best customers are. marion berry, george bush, the redskins. i'd like to offer you a job, cindy. can you type? take dictation? swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
yes, i know about it.  and i know that you acted as courier.  and let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
what is it?
ramona! don't get mia farrow on us.
i mean, that'd be too creepy. with us working together and all.
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon. i was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
i got to fetch her home...
very good.
talk louder. i can't hear you.
fucking out of order, that.  shouldn't be allowed.
thought i'd let you have first crack... later.
how old is she?
to do business.
fuck dat.  the time is fuckin' now. y'know i'm sorry 'bout sal's famous pizzeria, but i gotta live, too. i gotta get paid.
we ain't goin' down the river.
jesus, is it five years? i gotta quit right now.
not unless you can fly.
hm?
how will i get to her?
i said you win.
i'm just saying.

nothing.

deal.
out shopping -- you're bleeding, dad --
what now, sonny?
what happened next?
an excellent beginning  let him be…a duke. and your heroine?
she's a girl of so many interests.
it's under control.
1995?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
no, i'm fine.
excuse me.
boca?
did we warn them off?
this isn't about us.
weren't there high schools in el salvador?
you know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
i'd wrap him up in cellophant!
behind this door. a dark entity -- evil, ancient and hungry.
what?
did you decide on a runway yet?
hi.  i've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i'm thinking i didn't take them with me.  have you seen them around?
you heard what i said. i'm pregnant. i've been throwing up for weeks.
yes -- it will... now:  why is the president in china?
later.
overruled.
what?
you're crazy! it's freezing out there.

i don't know where he is.
california.
you want to talk about it?
b-l-a-k it is.
what?
yes, indeed.
that's your way, not mine.
no, no, i wasn't trying.
bah!! 
they wanted identification.  i don't have any identification.  i wasn't trying to hurt them.
that wants to be a yes.
i want you to come.
why, i'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
oh don't be all hypocrite. or do you really like other kicks? is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --

you can trust me on this one.
yeah.  sexy, huh?  and here's another: five. that's how old my other daughter is.  seven is my son's age.  two is how many times i been married and divorced.  you getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. and with all the other numbers i gave you, i'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
that you come with me tonight. once. to the opera.
oh, this is fantastic. so all we have to do is kill this moffit guy and we get all the money!
oh, yes. we do a tour of duty and we're finished. but you guys are never finished, are you?
i wasn't aware there was any law against it.
i'm very, very serious.
in his apartment -
oh, yes. right. the rat and parrot.
it's me who's wastin' time, sailor, bein' with you.
nobody knows about your mental retardation.
how do you mean?                                            ]
switch?  what fucking switch?
a building?
we'll make it, we'll be fine.
well, dawn, i'm an optimist by nature.
no back-up.
who's knows. my aunt marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
bullshit.
it's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
you could put it that way.
you gotta let me stay here tonight, grady.
oh, please. i'm not "pure of heart."
gaff rigged?  why not a staysail schooner?  go anywhere.  look at this -- the mayan, an alden schooner.
nobody's perfect. the way i heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
no, i'm not, i'm not worried. i'm not worried.
vernon, then. vernon hardapple. the scar's are from a -- from a horse. he fell during a race and got trampled.
that's it...
instruments fluctuating, captain. patterns unrecognizable.
i'm coming right over. i'll be right there.
no jokes.  james is in love.
i'm not scared, mrs. robinson.
what do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
whereas "wet 'n' wild" is an emotional journey. "tied and tethered". it's pretty moving huh? like anna karenina.
i know, pop.
oh, i get it; i'm dreaming!  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
r was worried about you  you didn't even call. you're always on my case if i don't call..
son of a bitch.
oh, i know he does.
i had it coming from someone.
they'll be here.
right now.
what's a ditty again?
that's what i told them.
frank.
coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
let my kid go.
that's off now.
yes.
you know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
she was very badly raped, you see. we were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. i was left a helpless cripple. the doctors said it was pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. the doctors told me it was pneumonia, but i knew what it was. a victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. suddenly his mood changes. he wheels right up to alex.
and a share. we will be partners, mr. fennyman!
not even if it's something positive?
maybe.  i said maybe.  what i mean is, ah...i don't think it'll really work out, but charley seems to want it, so...
what did we do?  joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
friends? who needs friends.  a boy's best friend is his mother.  you've never had an empty moment in your whole life. have you?
keep trying, sergeant.
so you really think she means you're going with her?
what do you call this? 
what?
there are always slanders, always lies. you're reading the devil's lies. can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the messenger.
how grand?
calendar?
mrs.  driscoll, if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
<u>right now</u>.  let's drive to vegas!
thank you.
yeah.
i'm working on it. soon as i find the right nerve bundle.
i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
you smiled at me.
what happened to them?
i show you. come. you come.  linda have special, crazy fuck. that right?
yeah.
leave me alone, can you?!
you own a home there?
dad already gave me this lecture. he's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with shelly.
supergirl?
yeah, we have.  you corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
you're not envious?
i -- i thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
i got it.  i was afraid i'd missed you.  i almost couldn't get a check cashed.  it's saturday.
i've got something on this. i know a guy on the inside with the military...
so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. they sent me to secretarial school, and i applied for a job with consolidated - but i flunked the typing test --
another additional.
he could be brought back.
come on--let's take a swim.
you did.
no. yes, i am. i am jealous. i want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
this way, miss.
working for the district attorney.
no one's coming to get you.  not while i'm around.
you didn't tell him about me?
you saw a lot in one night.
i'll always go back to that church. look at my painting.
dorothy, please!  we're trying to count! fifty-eight--
they shall not hurt you
i was afraid of that.
it doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
not good.
now?
you weren't going with her?
no.  it's the truth.  i know what you are.  like me, like bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  you don't have a social security number.  you don't pay taxes.  you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  you think you can do it again.  but i'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.
courthouse back in town.
no.
no.
was what worth it?
you're a horrible person, barry.  i mean it.
no, he called late last night.
koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
tell me -- let me help --
not this minute.
i'm nervous because i have and enormous crush on you.
i don't be-leeve this.
i need to get my goddamn head examined.  you can't rule something out on a whim. or because she's cute. i've been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now i'm tired! me!
what was he doing down here?  a billionaire waiting for the subway?  why not drown him in a bus?  why drown him at all?  why not shoot him?  is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis?  i mean, come on.
another hotel. down the road. martin lives there. he took your money. he’s got a safe...  i need a doctor...
yeah, 'good evening' to you, too.
for the mini-bike fund.
wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
yeah, geography.
what do you mean?
you can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
your "briar patch" turned out to be more hospitable than i expected.
this is how we fill up our lives.
quiet, mother.
yes sir.
ripley's plans.
that's not what we're here for.
put your hands up!
what?
no.
good, because it cost enough.  there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
that's right.
well, i definitely feel sorry for you.  august fourteenth, 1956... jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. doctor prescribed valium...
i don't know what you're talking about!
frank, you know as well as i do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
in a hospital.
dead.
uh -- yeah. i'm new here, and i'm supposed to be in this class.
don't know.  looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
yeah.
i disagree.  you think i've been acting strange.  like a completely different person.
i told you. i'm like positive.
the photos.
the forbidden zone was once a paradise. your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
like i said; so?
look, i told you i'm not going to college.
-- about what?
it's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
...and now you're making fun of me? i'm warning you! if you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, i'll never forgive you!!
it looks like a converted church.
you alright?
the d.a. gave me immunity.
so what? you going to help me?
all right, i'm with you.  i just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
look, glenn, i know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  you don't like what i'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
you capitalist pig!
what's that stand for?
whatever that means elena -- and you complain about me not communicating... i thought it was --
he your best buddy?
you're in a playful mood.
i promised the american people peace with honor in southeast asia.  that could take time -- two, maybe three years ... in the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
yeah, bring us four fernet.
not around here.  this is a rough part of the world.  hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  it's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  heck, even our dogs up and die.
my daughter. i haven't been on a bike for years.  when was the last time you rode a bike?
yeah.
what's so great about new york? i mean, it's a dying city. you read "death in venice."
i was sent as a military surgeon to south africa. stinking climate. taken prisoner. home on parole not to fight. i was a surgeon in the great war till the end. grenade in the face. carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. isolated two years.  i've been everything.
i don't know what's going on anymore. i thought i was square with that dude. now everybody's switching sides like it's the wwf.
i think about girls a lot.
i was with jessie, she filled me in.
right, right, what am i thinking of?
well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  radar gives me noise. sonar gives me noise.  infrared -- noise.  let's try ultraviolet.  there. flat.  it's totally flat.  a plain.
i promise... i swear.
she's on to him. you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
try to communicate with her somehow.
jesus christ.  i get in a good mood.  how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
the honorable elijah muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. if you got a mind.
well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
i should go to the house, get breakfast.
true.
-- forget it.  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  why do this?
however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.
don't have kids. other pictures--i don't know--it's nothing i want to look back on.
then you get your ass outta here, i don't wanta see you again...
ted!
why are you saying it?
hello ugarte.
he can't piss standing up anymore.
have you been to any parties?
how about this child? you expect *her* to be responsible?
i don't know. i mean yes, probably.
no, i don't mean the thumbs. you already told me about the thumbs.
yeah.
let some of us come down there.
mr. harris, we have fax for you!
somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it. actually, i didn't think about it at all, really.
rocky, i'm seventy-six years old. maybe you can be the winner i never was -- your shot is my last shot!
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. a fear of being gay. he objects to the word 'fairy.' plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead.  i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr. leeds.
what did you study?
i'm sure you're overreacting.
henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage, so don't tell me about business
oh.  well, for blackie then.
the world isn't going to end, you dummy; i hope you know that much.  but it is going to change. it's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. but there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. it isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. little pockets of humanity. like the clock people. like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave. there's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
we had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
the television said they've started with the looting already. vultures.
he's a cloven-hooved beast!
don't you dare lie to me!  i know you love me.  well, why don't you say something? come on--be brilliant. talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  shut up, you liar, you!  that's what i want!  this is real! money! cash!
look, marty, she's not your mother yet. and if you don't go through with this, she may never be. i know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. some choices must be made that are difficult. nonetheless, we must make them. besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. the fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . marty tried to smile at him.
that's so cool.
yeah, cool.
tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
can i come in for a minute?
so, what are we waiting for?
thanks.
on the floor!  get on the floor!
whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? inside your head. you never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
i'm not. i'm the sensible one. i'm always the designated driver.
listen, this ain't about us! it's about a thirteen year old girl. she's not gonna make it. unless we do something.
and rich people have none of those qualifications, i suppose.
did she mention any contests that she won? i mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
is it safe?
yes.  we won, that's right.
am i really her?
stella!
and when he got serious?
crashes into a jeep and totals his neck.  that's carl...
yep.
really.
maybe it needs special handling.
there's no one here, skipper.
of course. we went to school together. you're my oldest friend.
which will require twenty more hours at minimum, admiral...
then get him.
swimming?
i mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  are...
made a few quid, did ya? now where is it?
that's how it is.  you see her approaching you toss out installment one.
amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and i have no more concerns.
i won't let him.  he belongs to me now.  bye, sweetie.
you want to do this yourself?  i don't have to do this, you know.
thanks.  i'll keep it in mind.
what has artie to do with it.
but that's simone's part.
we was coming to see you.
that's why a.t.f.'s gotta make the case. i'm their witness. they wouldn't have a case without me. if it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? especially after i got you such a nice job.
it's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
he is huron and nothing else.  why would he want to murder the girl?
had one.  didn't work.
nothing is wrong with me.  i know something's in there - and so do you.
we keep it quiet. it's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. not with the press around.
sounds, voices, music, humming. all of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
they're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with comsec- intel like i said.
no, you're not.
no, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what i've been told.
kennedy's a catholic. he'll never win.
isn't that sweet.  well it could be any one of them bubi; i get to see them all.
this is a local writer.  kay had all his books.  i think we should check it out.
is that so bad?  it's not like i wouldn't try to make him happy.  for awhile, anyway. i mean, i would ... do things for him.  i guess i'm no good that way.  i guess i tried to sucker you along like that.  do you hate me for it?  i wouldn't blame you if you did.  but maybe it's like you said: you just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
wow.
two nights.
yes. uh, how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him?
and bill?
sure.  i'm fine.  i don't know why i never did this before.  i mean, what's the big deal?
i've got a boyfriend, mark.
i want children, i want a family. but i don't know when.
the movie's about <u>purity</u>.  so we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  we show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
no, a year of partying is enough. she'll be going to harvard this fall.
uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  and we need that in cash.
thanks.  may i offer you both a ride?
i ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
get out of my way.
but i'm not broke.
and get someone to help around the house.
i don't care!! there's gotta be another way. haven't you learned anything?!  haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
mmm...i mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
you know me...
can you do that?
what two?
you're right.  talking too much again.
let me finish. can i finish?
he didn't know. no one doing the deal knew except a few key people. this guy says they were real hush about it. whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
for whoever's in that thing.
i had some appointments.
great charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
and what it that?
how old are you?
the most valuable commodity i know of is information. wouldn't you agree on that?
what you were saying.  keep talking.
yes.
but if you did.
ouch! eat? you can do a solo if you don't step on it. i'm going to bow out on you.
it's beautiful.  it's just beautiful. they have a beautiful relationship.
yes, i saw the news. something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
i could use some help.  show me around.  i'll pay you for your time.
can i help you with something?
caesar?  what the fuck time is it?
just be patient.
at least i'm a growing person.
presence - with a double ass meaning gifts i bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause i throw what i know with a resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
it doesn't have to be.  everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin, you'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
of course you don't. now, lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? i have a nice fire going.
give me the goddamn page!!
i am. and that's why you should feel like a pig. you men make me sick. you'll sleep with anything that says yes.
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
really?
i didn't...
my car, not yours. yours is a complete wreck. the police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
just around that next bend.
glad to help.
no, it's not.
you wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
right.
no, i'm too hot now.
there's nothing to know, ann.
the killer was trying to get to her. that sorority girl was a distraction.
you know.  look at me like -- like i look at women.
no, thank you. they stain my fingers.
aw, gee, mom -- i had plans to play with mr. carpenter.
i don't know. my mind wanders.
yes, eve?
oh, yeah? well, how do you think i felt? you were singing in bowling alleys back then.  i told people you were a hooker!
look, frances, i'm only gonna ask this one time. i mean it. i swear after this, i'll never ask again: will you marry me?
scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
not now, wendy.
i...i...we need cash, james.
don't say it, hawkins.  i'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
who the fuck are they?  bob, are you working on revoking the posts's television license?  good.
you mean, you think i'm cracking?
they're here!  they're inside the house -- !
no...i'll be ok for a week.
what do you mean...
no, that sucks.  how are we getting out?
because you're relying on them alone. you don't remember what you've discovered or how. your notes might be unreliable.
24-hour tail on taransky?
yes -- he mentioned it.
if you want to see me you will not do this. you will make an appointment...
i've changed my hair, you see. since our last session.  those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
is the thing -- is it over?
what are you doing?
so, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
look, i can help. you need a sensor expert. you've got one.
she lied.  cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  besides, junior cut the phones.
since oxford. i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. he’s a man of great integrity.
the one that left you?
okay, kid, i have a deal for you! if you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores.'  they're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you any wish you want.
when? how?
you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
you're kidding?
int. postal van - day.
hello?  hello?
just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
punk.  quarterback punk.
i shouldn't.
course not, compadre. you'll see me again.
i don't know. just one of those. 
sighs as honora puts the frying pan on the stove.
get him alone for the summer. out in the wilderness. underneath the stars...
we'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
we cannot. some scarcely believe you are alive. other think you'll pay them mornay's wages. we bid you to edinburgh. meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. scotland will be one.
he was born fighting. and born hungry.
this is nice.
i'm not going to college, jos. and i'm not playing anymore baseball. this is my life.
i don't know...
you could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
so are you.  i mean you're a neat guy. we better get back.
you have to go with us, wes.
we get to peek into doucet's brain.
yeah. i was gonna write a book but i can't spell.
will they?
do yourself a favor:  don't ask.
let me come in.
this is great, we got cable.
don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
roughly, one-zero-five. i'll have it plotted in a minute, major kong.
you spotted them, huh?
certainly not!
i just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
the state police won't know how to stop him.
what am i gonna do -- i'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
you go too far, benedict.
pretty serious.
i just could never say it!
but how do we get in?
i don't get it.
yeah, well, i'm, but i...
did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. no friends. no phone.
she hated you --
holly. holly! please... the other sandman. remember the one who came after --
colonel will do.
and my nose...
that's all right.
so nix won't come looking for her?
i'm not leaving it here.
where is he?
i get that feeling.  you know, mr. tyler, i'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. but after spying you across the room, i'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
to the black pearl.
do you know who you're fucking with here?
so, how do i fit into this scheme?
looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job i've --
that sets it off.
in my handbag.
that means under a year. let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. there are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. dunbar's our guy.
excuse me, i'm late for a meeting.
you were very nervous.
what? the end of the world? man, don't give me your mad rap. i'm not a bartender. i don't want to hear it. i raise a family doing this bullshit. do me a favor. get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
the roumanian?
i-shan't see her. no, barbara, no.
did you?  kudos.
it's okay.  it's okay, now.  really.
she's got a hidden pitbull. maybe she hired someone to kill them.
he watches it for me. it's better than waiting at a garage.
but he didn't ask me.
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, sam? all that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know i was tightly wound--
well i didn't know about you until after she was gone.
gee thanks. now i don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
you shut up you, fuckin' retard. get your shit and get out of here.  that was a wake-up slap, frank. remember. reality, like i said. don't forget any bit of what i said to you and we'll be fine.
kate, scott?
who?
shirley and i come here regularly. i love romantic lingerie.
they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus. you'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  maybe a small roadside memorial.
it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
what the fuck is going on?
sure. of course.
no!  what do you want!!
i know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
on the contrary.  i want you - unharmed - perfect.
life is only life when it is bounded by death.  the inheritance is death. the gift is the finality of life. to be part of the fabric.  the inside.  i love you brenna.
cut the bullshit... okay, sanchez, you come with us.  norris... you stay here...  any of them move -- you fry 'em. and if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  and everybody watch whoever you're with.  real close.
does this look like the "queen mary"?? we don't take passengers! full steam ahead, captain engelhorn!
ok. take your coat, ann?
nah, that's just tony's way of telling me judge judy starts in ten minutes. you ever watch it?
what did it say?
well, i was just calling to tell you i was thinking about you and i miss you. i'll let you go.
just a few minutes ago.
thank you, daddy...
it's what you would do to me
no, you're only going to hurt him some more.
yes.
i had to park two blocks away. is something -
i promise not to run off to cancun.
get a coroner's estimate too.  -- miss, i've been transferred and i was disconnected. no one is answering and i need someone from security to pick up that line. it's urgent.
mulder. move away from the door. we're coming through it.
well that's what i'm trying to figure out. how long have you known him?
is that right?  think you're gonna make it with her?
i've got the boy on the phone.  he's using a cell phone.  what was that, son?  i didn't hear you.
of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... are his personal effects still at the palazzo?
menthol, regular, ultra-light.
did you move the bumble bee pendant?
big spender.
i understand.
in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection.  we gotta better ourselves."  you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>?
why?
no, no, no. we'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
jean... me dear, loyal jean... why do you want to oppose the will of god?  jeanne wanted to go to compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  then, on my personal orders, regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  and now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of god in all this?
what is he talking about?
yes, madam. and now madam will sleep. it is not long 'till the train.
you were never my guest?!
no i didn't.
lady cosgrove, you are an old fool.
can i help?
the young boy that died lit himself on fire. it was unfortunate, but how can they blame us?
no.
starling -
not at all. have a seat.
i put them in your hamper.  i thought they were dirty.
i don't like things that make you cry.
i'd like to see his house but...i don't know if i'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. i don't think i can go through with it.
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again.
nobody asked you to.
you're very square. pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
yes?
that's love.
doesn't matter.  i like change. you know, constant turnover.  as soon as i close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
in time you will meet them all.
tournel will take you the rest of the way...
well--i can *manage*--
his mother needs a piece of his hair. it's for the keeping of the souls ceremony.  has to be kept for four days.
someone you loved very much.
spike!
geller...you wanna be a reporter? take a look at what sells! sex scandals. bribery. people jumping off buildings. so unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
you can admit that, can't you?
nope, he ain't wade.
maybe.
bruckner's seventh. the adagio.
but how do you know you exist?
that's very kind of you, mr. o'higgins.
"we just got up and left. bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
ma's shore gonna like it here. she ain't been treated decent for a long time.
we were friends once...  but that was a long time ago.
i love you, norm.
well, let's get back to the case in hand. they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
why would you be there?
seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
the scum of the earth.
yeah!  like me!  i don't choke on my own gall - i fight back!  let them choke, not me!
yeah.
oh, no.  she tells this story at every major holiday.
i dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. man, i really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of petticoat junction, man.
you know? i remember coming here with my parents.
we're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'reform the reds with a rope'.
hi, jennifer.
quite right!
that's fine with me...  get it? fine. a fine! hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
then what? who's going to do what?
yaay!
that's right.  you're absolutely right...it's been a long time since i made french toast.
it will and you know why? because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the united states army; you have no identity, no miranda warning, and no rights. so i'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, i'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
i know we are. but as the years go by, we become even worse. isn't that so, corrado?
perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is. you are now a priest, but you were once a musketeer, serving the throne of france, a throne ordained of god. can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
thank you.
how ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
well, bill -- mind if i call you bill?  let me be frank. i've made a lot of money. i've got my own business in detroit. rivets. i make rivets and sell them to fisher body.  well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. when my business manager told me i should shelter some money, i thought i'd try this.
how many have you lost?
see? you're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
oh, miles. that's awful. what are you going to do?
uh... eighty two?
three...i just thought of a third... if you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
it's elvis...
you are?
pest control. gotta do your apartment.
you asked for it.
you took bill.
just so you do your work.
and even if we haven't seen it yet, i'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
it's about to be a broken face.
no.  that's what i mean - i'm being fired for what i didn't do.
when i was a kid, i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
who pays for them?
oh, no, no, no.  he's my sister's husband.  and i think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. he's very intelligent.
oh, the poet? where?
i think you do.  but i thank god we all don't.
maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. no thanks to you.... what you think of the hair?
come on.
what?
beginning of what?
you don't really --
pris.
go to hell.
twenty-five thousand for clothes.
something he said, just before...
are you hungry?
they did not!
it's based on the life of doctor martin luther king.
believe me, i know your feelings on the matter.
no. this time i'm in for the long term. this is not a liquidation, gordon. i'm going to turn it around. you're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, i could modernize the plant. i'm not the only one who pays here gordon. we're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe stasi, maybe kgb.  he's smart, gregor is.
cause i have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. what do you say we cut to the chase. i'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
and why should we believe you?
if you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
zorin must not have gotten instructions. somebody in their foreign ministry's blown it big-time.
you know, you are really doing very good work here.  i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
it's cracked -- and you never use it. and it's too ornate. i'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
how bad off is he?
she's my daughter.
i'm swell.
you don't have to do this.
with her mother.
my daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
oh no. now for the fire.  strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
and you stock these things for what, to fend off russia?
you were pretty bad, huh?
sorry.
i got lured.
caviar capital of the world. matchless beluga. firm, yet subtle.  largest landlocked body of water on earth.  oil-rich.  hitler wanted it. stalin beat him to it.
what do you want, biff?
hector thinks you like him.
so do you.
where'd you spend last night?
what are you going to do?
that's good then.  you've found something.
it's not true.  you have to believe me.
right.  so why don't we get on with this investigation?
nah!  what's he got? this is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. it's not the money. not for you. why can't i get ahold of it?  cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
what the hell is that?
where have i heard this song before?
who?
not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  i wonder, did your wife leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
i couldn't get you in.
and i also believe in god and the devil. in fact, i know they exist.
herb, it's too much. it's all out of hand.
i am alone in the world.
you ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
not when you're up here with the gold, i guess not.
so where are the 'environmental concerns' the admiral was talking about?
yes he is.
you're not funny.
we didn't talk about it -- you did.
see ya tomorrow.
you sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
you saw a mig 21?
uhuh...probably a good idea.  why don't you do it this time?
it won't happen again.  scout's honor.
we all do.  but now it's body time. relax.  ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with devonshire cream. you feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  think of your muscles one by one.  let them go slack.  relax.  let the brain go blank.  relax.  that's the idea-- that's my girl.  now the small of the back.  let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
jeez, what do you think? to see it!
stop it.
now i can get out a here -- if i can find a way out.
yes, sir?
taransky isn't that good an actor. no, they're taking special precautions.  some kind of new encryption.
eugene de beauharnais.
you're right. i didn't tell you that.
look.
quit kidding.  you did that vulcanizing job on toothpick charlie - and we know it.
uncle elroy, who's that girl by day-day's car?
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your libbets thing a secret from him?
that is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied france.
bye you guys. _ 88.
glad you could fit me in your schedule.
in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. steven, it's so unfair.
i sit. i think. i play games.
don't worry. she's good with kids.
yeah.
no, nothing.  i've got a problem, i guess.
then what will?  and what will bring her back?  and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
a seminal film. first ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
yes.
what?  i talk like a cop, this is the way i talk.  i can't believe this guy.  saks.  he's a deputy assistant director of the f.b.i. "let me help you!"
in order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. comprende?
how can i go on a feeling?  you think coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
good morning.
heaven.
because there's nothing to see.
is it?
yes, well, they are.
i know so. he's a taker.
i know precisely where he'll be.
lie, you mean...
if a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
landon, honey. there's nothing more.
it's not good for you, animal.
i don't watch tv and i hate books. whatta you need?
i was. an experiment. just to see if i could do it.
maybe two, three months after juarez. i was visitin' my cousin, junior train, in savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. a girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
are you reasonably awake?
no, sir.
do you suppose that was our problem? we met before our time?  i think that happens a lot.  people, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
you mind?  i'm working here.
very romantic setting.
he knows something's up.
that's okay, 'cause i know exactly what that's like. listen-
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we haven't got the power of attorney yet!
that's terrific.  don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  you're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
no. it didn't, buff.
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
she's a drag. a well-known drag. we turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
don't you see? whatever's going on... i'm part of it.
why not. i trust you. you couldn't turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege... and i don't want to be "withholding"... and i know where you live.
and we have found each other nothing will ever change that! i am your family, dear child, but i may not be your home.
yes, he is.
no!
what do you mean? you don't even know me.
chulo, one thing at a time.
maybe ya better forget it.
this is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
blockhead started it!
oh yeah. there's a lot of stuff. currants and strawberries ... here. i'll show you.
you want me to make you a sling? it's no problem...
yes, ma'm...
who's lisa?
we have to transport mr. israel to las vegas, time is of the essence. the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international. i'm sorry, i'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. return to washington. you'll be debriefed in the coming days.
i'm gonna do it, carmen. i'm gonna sign up for federal service.
yo, tavis, check it out.  this is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  like my man mase says, "it's all about the benjamins."
who knows? right.
i don't want to be here. don't worry, i love you, daddy, i do. but i want to go home.
let me tell you something. in our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. the guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. they get in, they get out. nobody knows a goddamn thing. understand? boom, boom, boom. three in the head and you know they're dead.
i don't believe you.
-where?
insertion.  call in to base camp by transat.  proceed to point tango november for rendezvous with our ground contact.  indigenous agent. co phuong bao.  we've been over this three times.
the what?  but you are tired and you must rest awhile.  midget! crapper!
your boy.
i do.
who are his ghosts?
i do! mom's gone crazy!
you're losing me.
well, uh...promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
what?  oh, the flat tire?  yeah, i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
five times a day?
i know, i met him.
i think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
what?
answer yes or no.
hello brenda.
it's extremely complicated, and i'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
i have a terrible confession.
yeah.
why? what did he say?
sure.
if i ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
we did what we had to do. tommy don't forget. sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if tommy don't die.
do you know what he's saying?
i think so.
we'll have to give leo a refund. because he's gotta go to the m.e. in case you don't know, officer, violation of the major crimes act on --
in reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of tyler's contribution...
nowhere... hi, daddy.
that what's happening to you, only faster?
plant it, animal, and grow us a chicken for christmas.
cannibalism, to be extreme.  and now we're talking about a new life form. their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
he needs to be turned over.
a wife.  she left.
that would be mars krupchek.  jesus, he works for me, too.
you liked your teachers?
say again?
i want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. and they get to be men--and forget even more. liberty is too precious to get buried in books, miss saunders. men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "i am free--to think--to speak. my ancestors couldn't. i can. my children will."
god, i want to go home.
how do you know?
yeah?  and what are you going to do tonight?
it's starting....
don't worry.
i'm not a tweaker.  i don't use drugs. i never had.
no... i can't... i got tired. i want to live my way.
well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
the later events have never been kept a secret.
no, he can't.
my parents always say hard work builds character.
okay, good tip.
you ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
give me what i want -- and i'll consider it...
what is it?
you can if you want.
yes.
my umbrella?  oh, that's just a relic. i found it when i was packing to come to america. it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  a long time ago.
he's a good friend of mine. drops by the club whenever he's in town.
low enough to relay internet traffic.
we don't think this place is safe.
i'm still here, aren't i?  see this?
but you can't kick me out!  guys want to kill me!  you're a nun!  a big nun! aren't you supposed to have compassion? for the wayward sheep?  i mean, i'm a major sinner!  all-time great!  hall of fame!  aren't i, like, your dream come true?  your olympic event?
i...
look, i wasn't serious about you taking sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
saddle river's in new jersey.
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
i don't mean that. how would he act? what would he do?
well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  specially for mr. hooks.
what does that mean?
but you triple-dog-dared me.
no matter. there's nothing i can do about it.
merle, have you met my sister-in- law deanna?
i rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
frank.  fuck it.  okay?
what have you done, lsd?
no. no, i'm fine. maybe i should go. i mean... i don't want our first time to be like this.
what's wrong?
i can't believe he'd do this.
come on, man, i'm not trying to scam anybody here, i'm just--
i-i-i-i would leave out the men's- room attendant.
only silence. it's always like this.
i'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
you figure him for a dope runner?
i think... about... "who's the boss?"
caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
that's right. only 10 exotics ...
oh yes. i've read it over and over again. this baby's the real deal. daddy's little angel. a paradigm of chastity and virtue.
and while i feed my family in new york, you put the knife in my back in miami.
we have mice! i mean it, ralph! i saw one!
in for what?
you think i'm <u>that</u> nuts?
shut up!  where's that other miyatea?
i didn't know she belonged to anybody.
where do i sign, mr. thatcher?
what did tommy say?
you gotta. you gotta stay alive. you know what they were trying to do here. you got the pigs dead to rights. it's like huey said, you're more important than any of us.
well, guess i don't even need to be here...
howard is a beautiful person.
almost two a.m.
yes, adulation is a cross to bear. god knows <u>i</u> know.  but someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and don't deny it, mr. cobblepot, you've got the magic!
alright!
listen, folks, it's a fact that i didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
that's entirely understandable.
sure.
not at all. we're just finishing lunch.
. . . what??
a trial takes <u>time</u>, beckett. do you know what i'm saying?
well, we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage. it cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
mr. jameson--
we've never met.
what hospital?
worry about your own goddamn lunch!
he was murdered.
that's what they call an events cluster. some guy, nobby orders a manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
okay.
we started talking.  in fact, we talked until four in the morning.  we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  after that we were together all the time until he left. he used to call me every night after he came back.  then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. i've never left.
you're all kidding yourselves. even with top of the line crypto.  cray access. stu 3's --
we're all very proud of you, harry, but what the hell is it?
you're not missing much.
right.  and the sky would fall ...
look closer.  do you have anything to clean it with?
let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we'll see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
i'll take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.
yes.
did i say anything?
fine.
you mean -- break in?
oh no, not another worthless trinket, jonathan, if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you.
turn on cnn.
is it possible.  yes.  but --
lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
guidance and assistance! that's insane! doc, ya gotta help me.
this has been a real confusing day.
yes.
and you believe her?
...why?
now don't get excited.  don't get excited!!
i want you to stay with me.
utopia is lost to me. my daughter is gone.
i do not think i like the sound of that.
no.
yep. i didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. you got a broom or something with a-
well, what about the building and loan?
the police?  we'd never live to testify. not against spats colombo.  wabash 1098.
by the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  he missed out.
see you tomorrow, maybe.
what -- what sort of action do you mean?
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... all this time, i've never had the courage to touch it.
no, we should reach the base of the brain shortly. and from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
i doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
i wouldn't do it.
let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
ok.  that's true.  is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
come in, children.
you don't mean that doctor?
shut up!  security officer, eh? screening everybody, only who screened you? great american hero. from cleveland, ohio! enlisted right after pearl harbor! when was pearl harbor, price? or, don't you know?
you're late, not me.
can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
okay, i guess.
that’s easy. you’ve seen my car.
frank told me.
jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about mr. lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? well--that was *you*. someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. this country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! and when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
and he has finer moments now and then.
oh, jackin' off?
no, i'm serious.
compliments of lando calrissian.
yeah.  you want to go dancing tonight?
neither do i.
promise me....
we're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. and the perception is that crystal lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  that, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
i'm getting it back.  don't worry about me, mick.  i'm fine.  d'you find the obstetric nurse?
yes
you did something on impulse?
don't get any ideas. of course it comes out of your share.
everybody's too stupid!
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous.
it seems to me i been reading about you in the newspaper.  busted out of some joint in florida, huh?
too bad... you missed an inspiring day, anna.
yes, i have mine.
i can't.
the nurses?
really?
i did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
negative.  negative.
then hold it off the air until you got that. but i want to go to new york. and i want to go on the record. right now!
how sad. it's tragic, isn't it? such a talent.
i know who he is...
he did it to make you stay with him!
nothing.  to hell with this place and all the people here.
sometimes right when you're looking at them.
now!  seal that tunnel now!
terry...?
oh, just checking something for an old friend.
not too bad, thanks.  how have you been?
fusing for ten thousand air burst.
linda, yeah.
i checked on her. she had the electric heater. cold don't bother her as much as me. which is why i give her the heater.
oh, i'm captivated.
maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
she's upstairs. she wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
do you know where i can steal some?
bruce. son. listen to me. you are a kind man. a strong man. but in truth you are not the most sane man.
no.  i'm just depressed.
i'm your daughter all the time, you know.  not just when it's convenient.
but tonight is christmas eve!
maybe this wasn't just a trick. maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
yes.
it was different...
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
yes. yes, i do.  yes, i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
... you have to sack me.  i understand, sir.  i'll go quietly.  in fact i'll go right now.
the other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
what?... oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
no, not a thing. would you like to go out?
so attack is your defence. well let's hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction.
i'm told unusual promises were made to wigand.
yes...look, during the last five years we were married, i had...i was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  i needed to talk to somebody.  i needed to find out if it was me, if i was going crazy or what.  but every time i turned to ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  he became very...i don't know, very threatened.  i mean, when- ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  finally, i had no other choice, i had to leave. and because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, i had come to have almost no self- esteem...  at the time i left, i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasn't a terrible person.  and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
she did, huh.
she ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
-- this is mr. laszlo.
you can't be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown.
i <i>was</i>...
you are a resilient man, mr.
she wants to give you your money. if she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
you don't have to say anything.
i know.
peace is made is such ways.
why? you gonna do something about it?
lady has some deep pockets.  that's all i'm saying.
i'm ready to be briefed.  excuse us.
i think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
who the hell would you call?
whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. everyone should have some mother wit.
my ex-wife's in miami.  it's nice down there.
oh, man...
we'll find you a hotel.
the last i looked, we were just talking things over.
ah, wear whatever you want.
i do?  how long will you be staying?
the ad..
well... i'm for it...
no. any idea which channel he's on?
agreed. options?
did you shoot the rapids?
if anyone orders merlot, i'm leaving. i am not drinking any fucking merlot!
i'm tired, judy.  i'd like to change the subject.
well, i'm not going to stop it.  i'm going to say exactly what i think.  you've never given me anything.  you've tried to buy me into giving you something.  you're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  that's what it's been from the first moment i met you.  no matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  tried to bribe them!
what did he want you to do?
thank you, floris.
and why did you drop them?
so you don't have to play innocent with me. he used to tell his wife that i was the branch manager from seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
-- never mind.
so... even you don't believe in me anymore...
goddamnit!
we played with a code using <u>the new</u> <u>york times</u> obituaries.  over three years we played twelve matches.  i never won.
stop! who approacheth the bridge of death must answer me these questions three! ere the other side he see!
of course --
didn't work out that way.  he busted out with a big indian. they capped two guards on a road gang. nice meeting you reggie.
i'm scared.
look, you're a nice guy, but i'm not really dating right now.
what?
blood.
my dear major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
not me... all my other my patients. i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
he's heading down the stairs, now..
no.
reach out farther. call to her.
for the artistic effect.  the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  it's quite striking.
i said give me time.
why then.
i've only got a couple left.  i'm saving them for later.
w-w-whatta you mean?
you've just said yourself, miss, we've already stamped it. why should we stamp it twice?
he just needs some clothes?
tomorrow is the full moon.
it's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
maybe he's hiding from something.
they could have many ways of destroying things, mr. decker.
it never solves anything.
what?
how the hell do you know all these random songs?
what's your name?
what's it narrow down to?
awww-rr, buddy, come on, you know me!
i'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
not until the very last second. we must think of something... something to save the situation.
can you use these?
yes.
and the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. and the third rule...
i just wanted to keep an eye on you.  the guy's a total stranger, remember?
you're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  here's your ticket.
don't you see carla?  i made them immortal.
there are no answers. there's either jason bourne alive or jason bourne dead. and i for one would prefer the latter. and what about her?  you just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
that's not going to stop his nightmare -
oh, that's will. he's a friend. you'd like him.
did you get up from your seat?
you... fucked her!  goddamn dumb sonofabitch... you fucked her! goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
i want you out of town before the hanging.
what are we gonna see?
geronimo?
i sometimes fade out.
asshole, can't talk.
no.  at least not in the legal sense.
i'm still thinking about it.
grace heard it.
dude. that's my sister.
well, then put him at the singles table.
this is something else.  they're curious.  curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
six months.
once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. then we swim out.
yes, i do.
it's only ten o'clock.
we'd like to ask you some questions about daniel zavitz.
dad!
out the back.
i heard.
what <u>are</u> you interested in? 
"a people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - yes, and then to get around them..." nietzsche said that.
i'll keep that in mind.
here. got pictures.
i'd prefer you didn't.  i'm very busy.
the pin machine?
how long will she he away?
i realize, you're under a lot of....
i will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
i must get to my ship, mr. shermin.
ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
what do you mean by that?
i don't think so, i think she's confused about death.
but you must come in.
this is it.
hey, it's the will.  i, marvin acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters...
i got it. you're talking about your dog. i thought that was the name of the colored man i've been seeing in the hall.
yeah.  but he ain't here now.
i know!  i'm sorry   i didn't mean for it to happen!  and i was the one they were shooting at!
yeah, uh-huh... okay.
well, winter's far behind us now.
we've lost bridge control!
where's bill?
do you know what you were kidnapped by?
with enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
sooze wants to see him.
hey, grant.
why would he do that? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip.
you brave soldier.
no women. not in boodles. not since 1922.
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
sure.
oh, listen to me. i've never even been there and look what i say about it. anyway, i know there'd be nothing for me to do. i don't even know anybody there.
who's calling?
we're not going to do anything.
it doesn't make any sense.  it paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
miss it?  it drives us crazy.  that's part of what this club is about.  in fact, i'd like to announce that i've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the dead poets society, demanding girls be admitted to welton, so we can all stop beating off.
so it would seem.
i wonder no longer.  you were out of the country.
it was in chinatown.
yeah... i think so.
but you said toxic.
what are you doing here?
okay. san diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  it's big.
sun glasses?
don't you never say that --  -- you guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- you guys are scum.
yes?
yes, sir.
something like that.
that's not proven, 655321. in fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
well, my parents split up when i was thirteen, and... god, i actually had to... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them.  so i chose my dad.  it just felt safer that way, you know?
if possible -- both.
i'm going shopping.  don't try to stop me.
he's gonna be awright.
no.. i've slept enough.
tell me again.
no, we just checked the beach...
but after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! please, come with me, i'll show you!
april.
look. you don't know good. all right?
me and you, great!  gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these washington suckers right where you want 'em.  poor frankie five-angels.  he always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
when...when will she be back?
tell me. what do the police say?
he will. i know he will.
and stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  your finest hour! you rose to the challenge, baby! and you lost. that's the best part!
i'm sorry.  i don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  you've been a great help to me, and i've let you down.
you were supposed to be reading words.
hi.
it sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
near carvel?
but ringo starr doesn't look anything like topol.
if you knew why, you might know where to look for him. i don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  now, i've done what you asked me.
wait.  wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
i'm just thinking i'm glad i broke up with everyone i ever went out with.  the swelling is gonna go down, right?
ya say we're acrost?
ohhh yes.  no, no.  just a little, you know...we're fine.
you keeping out of trouble?
what -- ?
that you overreacted.  that you lost it.  not me.  it was your mistake.
here.  this'll put hair on your chest.
fine. 
no, it was so right it scares me.
where the hell have you been?
not according to the computer.
wait a minute! you're not a detective any more. what's going on?
would you?
he'll say that?
i have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
so...?
nothing.
what?
well, somet...
i got a feeling.  i have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
but i think i know where she'll be....
without the body we have no physical proof. we need a confession.
i still have your virginity!
yes. and i'll be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever.  can you control your fear?
they're big details, jerry.
you paying for the gas?
that smell's still fillin' this room good.
yes, i will.
are you working with her?
i like your bar.
you'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. she killed a man.
try standin' in the door and hollerin: mama i'm home.
oh... i've just been thinking about something that man bytes said.
sooner than later.  you really need to.
sure.  lots of times.
sidney, i know you by now.  don't do a dance with me...
local lawyer for dominican dealers.  off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf.
unh, unh.
all right, dad. yes, i'll call him.
rose this not the place to be having this...
very first motherfuckin' thing they did. they see i put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. they roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. fuckin' scare my woman, sherona, half to death. she thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
okay.
all right, man, just settle down. we'll get outta here, claude. we'll get outta here real soon.
it's true, isn't it?
no, we'll go through here.
i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
mention it, don't insist.  barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
need any help?
oh, thanks, bobo.
they meet on main street.  her horse has just died.  he's coming from the fire.
yessir.
if they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
no need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
on the three days paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  we got people in the phone company.  thank god it was paulie...we'll need clemenza bad.
no--no.
thanks. wow. that's--really nice to hear.
what a gasser.
i'm good at that.
i hear things, too.  people call you the mayor of darktown.
94   continued:  
sounds all right.
i forgot my bag.
know what?
you mean, "consuela" is a good mother..
message acknowledged. all units will be informed.
yes.  that will be company for you.
not since november.
is what true?
near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. you head for the school. now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. that's where annie hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. you ask her about the little brenner girl.
roach, what are you doing?
oh, my poor stomach.
you said the guy down here is good.
sorry?
stick up?
whoa-oh!  sorry, i...
wouldn't you like to meet him?
it's all over the place, everyone knows.
nothing. not even a stick of gum.
we're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  the cook quit yesterday.
of course.
sitting right behind you.
nothin'. i just figure you were the right man for the job.
no  there is something...something there i can't tell... i can't describe it.  there are things there.... but i'm... here.
it hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. as a matter of fact, you're looking at it. the remains of margo channing. sitting up. it is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
you didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
in the bag underneath.
no they're not. i wanna be a writer, i wanna be just like you.
don't try to suck up to me! it's a little late for that. i'm a freak! look at it, it's been rendered useless.
no, no.  i was wondering...man oh man. i think i feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that i came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but i think i'd be a fool if i didn't do something i really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
it was good.
can you try?
how do you know?
utah? i thought you'd be going to new york or paris. what's in utah?
huh?
when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh...  ...the powwow safe.
what the hell are you talking about?
saw my mom... i'm with debi, and i'm on my way to the reunion.
why not?
there's a message for you at the office. your kid was hurt.
you must hate your brothers.
but not you.
we need padded chairs.
oh, it's an exciting time then. i'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so i guess it's no surprise i didn't recognize your name. jesus, i feel like a heel.
sir?
speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station.
i wanted to be sure of something, general -- something that has always preyed on my mind. i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
i could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  put him on.  ken, i'm sorry, it was goddamn beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  slow down, ken, you sound frazzled.  a wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, ken.  ken, i would never print that you were in marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
andy... there is no real you.
barks at his master.
it was my choice.
i sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
you son of a bitch.  did you really think you could elude us forever, carlos?
dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on saturday night.
i'm simply quoting the law.
according to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  there's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
kevin, this is serious!
a black bull came.
can you believe that was me?
never
if i'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
i don't need them, sonny.  i'm just going to see pop in the hospital. also, i got other things.
god dammit.
thanks.
he's gonna find out.
i don't know!
terrific. i've got three choices. watch the kid sleep, listen to lynda screw, or talk to you.
what about your grandmother?
no, brett, i...
i miss things. i miss... people.  i miss reading to the boys.
too late....stay close.
all right. now let's get to bed.
um-<u>hum</u> ...
i'm bored. i'm alone all day and i don't know what to do.
you were one of those guys that played dungeons & dragons with real swords, weren't you.
at your house. don't you remember?
stop tearing me apart!  you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
all right.  i'll have to look for it.
yeah. just babies.
i don't want to offend the customs of your country.
if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
i'm so sorry if you were offended!
hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
...what're you saying?
whattaya mean family?
is this the best you can do?
nor you for me.
people. they could be looking.
if anyone's going, i could use some coffee.
hello.
he's dead...
...they asked us to dinner.  how can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
it certainly is.
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never been. she loves me the way i am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> i don't want everything to change. i don't want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.
drunk-rolling job.  they hit him too hard.
yes?
i think we're through for the night.
...i'm going to need your help...
anything else bothering you?
well, i've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now i'm trying to write a novel.
forget it, jani. it'll never work.
it's too far.
if you have something to say, i suggest you say it to morpheus.
dude, watch me work.  they go for sensitive studs like me.
i need a sample of your blood. what do your borg friends say? resistance is futile. 
sir, yes, sir!
thank you.
there were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
that is so sexist. the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct.
ain't got time.
no.
goodbye, darling.
yeah, non-believer?  here's yours...  "scorpio, october 24 to november 22: jupiter is in conflict with saturn, so proceed with caution..."
yeah.  it was an unusual place to be.
sir elliot.
oh no, i, i...eh...i couldn't.
too bad.  what did your father do?
'who's afraid of the big bad wolf, the big bad wolf...'
you're in no condition to ride.
murderer!
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office.
please. he got straight a's without ever touching a book. that was the one area where his memory never failed him.
that's a bet--but i couldn't let you walk out like that, sally. i'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
an explosion, just like paul's.
mr. thomerson, i...
don't worry, i'll desire. boris, could i have some more coffee.
well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
weaver, i'm an insect, not a liquid.
we want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  we'd like grandchildren.
hurry up. put your shoes on.
the don has semi-retired.  i'm running the family business now. so anything you have to say, say it to me.
because he's dying.
the duchess...
him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
i dunno ...
uh-huh?
hell ya. we broke that mothafucka.
i always wanted craftsman tools. he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors.
fifty grand gouge. south shore hayseeds, this is why i never play tahoe, or redneck reno...
where ?
danny, what about the jews?
that's right.  kevin.  she's mrs. kevin bannister.  she lives in australia.
have you gone to the police?
i've took as much of you as any man can
well, i need to see this with an audience!
with what just happened upstairs --
faster!
she didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? and don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
we don't have rooms, bob. we have cells.
how do i know you're telling the truth?
ahoy!
what if he's dead?  what if you killed him?
that's right. and you beat round 1. now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes. i'll have your girlfriend. we'll be waiting.
uh-uh.
yep.
you and the land are one. drink from the chalice. you will be reborn and the land with you.
yes, sir, but i can get him...
you hear about your old friend, diego?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  jesus, alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
yeah, well, i'm sorry too.  it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now i'm broke. i can't hardly pay for this beer. not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. do you understand what i'm saying? my credibility. so yeah, i'm sorry, too. about as sorry as i've ever been in my whole fucking life.
yayyy!
did i do something wrong, mr. hand?
aren't you going to change?
this t-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
yeah, when do i get my hypnosis? you guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
oh yeah.  you mean peek-a-poos.
i'm tired of this.
that's what i'm thinking, rita. maybe...
they tried to kill you?
well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
yeah. he said that.
me.  i have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
and you expect me to come over, just like that.
oh, sure. sure. we don't want to fire arthur.
i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today.
what about the sender?
how unfortunate. so when did you finally get to see a penis?
you shouldn't have.
where'd you learn how to do that?
sir, i... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
yes it does.
sure.
what are you tired from?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
you looking for some action?
well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine.
and if that means negotiating...
where could he have gone?
what "seven dwarfs?"
well... one time, mr. wheeler's secretary, lydia, told me mr. wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
how could you do that, benjamin?
an accident wasn't good enough...
i did--and--and i got right up.
maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... and then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. no one asked them. it's just gone...
give 'em what you got. offer to help. show a willingness to be helpful. you want to stay out of jail, don't you?
this place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
not a very good one i'm afraid.
what right do you have to take me for granted?
thank god. i could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
it has not been used yet in this prison. the governor has grave doubts about it and i have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
nobody's that unhappy.
i'm great. always set my fingers on fire. if you want to see another trick. i do this thing with my nose.
you know about the palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. i was one of them.
not after the vote next week.  once the amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
hair on her hand. plus jen- nifer had raven black hair.
what else?
yes, there is.
riots?  my people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. launch.
i don't have a week.  this case never should have come to trial. you know better.  you're mr. independent.  you want to be independent?  be independent now. i've got no sympathy for you.
no, he...got some news today.  he'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
bring the warp core on-line. i'll lay in a heading.
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
that money is my whole future.
don't need to, the krauts go that covered.
i'll be back at 9:00.
where are we going?
please...
because he asked you to! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his katra. his living spirit.
no. no. no. this is my doing. you see i'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. for lois and the kids, for my brother, for franco. i'm gonna turn myself in. i am all that. i'm gonna do it for sweet lois.
yeah.
what?
ok. boy. jesus!
oh, just a day--
ah, but how will you capture us? we know the secrets of the fire swamp. we can live there quite happily for some time. so, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
what a heel!  i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, i buy me a new negligee, i bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
we'll get you together!
you own this place?
but we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
get back!  now!
pamela landy, again. where do we stand?
he kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  he showed me.  i visited a few times.  then one of jonas's guys visited.  when i arrived, your dad was dying.
i'd do much more - for a part that good.
...have a nice day mr. stone.  ... mr. gekko, the conference call is ready. mr. sugarman and mr. lorenzo in delaware. mr. bernard in los angeles. mr. jackson and ms. rosco in london. they're all on.
ay-eh...made out i was crazy...  ate dirt...chewed grass...i fooled 'em, ethan!...an' i got away...
honeythorn gump, is it?  i've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
well, let's go talk to your doctor.
your farewell to the troops?
yeah...
actually, diz, i promised carmen...
a short somewhere.
[do you know who i am?]
he could give me some oxygen.
rudolf?  c'mere, rudolf!
the nano... what?
i can hear myself starting out. "your honor -- i have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  he'd throw the new york state penal code right in my face. -- and it's six volumes.
somehow, i don't see that happening.
don't sulk.  what brought all this on?
hey... you're not supposed to be up.
...i made a detailed physical examination of the patient, sir, yesterday evening, i...
in a minute, hon. let gage finish his turn.
yes, sir.
if you want me to go away, i'll go away.
after the divorce.
the point... 
have we had trouble there before?
mr. dickson?
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
oh, i do want to know.  i tried to reach you at the precinct.
do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? no i don't suppose you would. it's quite a thrill, craig.
we just live one flight up.
it was april.  april seventeenth. that one i remember.
it's new.
devereux. my brother cole dated a european girl once.
i thought so!
yeah, i'm real glad you brought that up.  i was going through your file here, and i ran into these medical records.  they kinda surprised me --
am i missing somethin' here?
control, this is enterprise requesting permission to depart.
acknowledge.  winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, are you near any natural shelter? over.
test it.
it's steady, good benefits.
a bowling alley.
get the fuck out of here. get out! get the fuck out!
yeah. thanks.
you turned renard.
to misery.
for a change.
ash... ashley...
but you tore it up.
you think you're doing these people a favor? what are they going to do? either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
well, if the a.t.f. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
you took the words right out of my mouth.
ye...
what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
one considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
must have known i was broke. even sent me an airplane ticket. it's a shame.
this man creates for a living! he puts food on your table and on mine! thank him for it!  thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! thank him or you're fired!
get some rest, dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  we'll talk then.
both.
so much for your nightfall.
-- and you haven't moved out yet. it's because you're too lazy, ben. too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
know the millertown bluff?
graham.
scagnetti? oh shit, i hear he's a motherfucker.
yeah.
who am i?
oh, i think we're going to have several.
thank you for loving me.
hello, ruben...  so that's that...
she's the best damn witness we have!
graduation?
dead or alive?
of course i remember him. i'm sorry. you were terribly fond of him.
you got it.
christ, traxler. how the hell should i know?
that's too bad.
took you long enough.
we have matching luggage.
me too. that's why i put this one up.
who said anything about love?
cease fire! withdraw!
i always check the batteries.
how'd you get the tape?  why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
at eleven at night? _ 70.
what are we going to do, take a taxi?
a pretty young maiden she happened my way...
well, i tell you, yesterday when i was here, i had one of your books in my hand, and when i got outside, i realized i still had your book in my hand. so as long as i had your book in my hand, i thought i might as well take it home and read it. this morning, i got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. she'd bring him sandwiches and hot dr. pepper.
no. please enlighten me.
well, i got homework.
what about the trees?
you're outta your depth here, miss darrow!
who?
next time you try that, mr. mitchell...  ..don't. i'm warning you.
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
of course, of course that's what i'm <u>saying</u>.  as the old mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
no --
what's in connecticut?
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- he could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
barry, i'm fucking broke!  i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
this?  i'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
what are you going to do?  charge me with smoking?
got you!
we've got to stop him right here, now!  with that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
some other time.
not what...who.  seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned.
you were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so i figured i'd help you out.
do you want me to come with you sid? i mean, remember what randy said?
hey, angela, sal and i go back a long way.
no, i haven't, mom. i promise you... i saw it!
yeah?
you're drunk --
she is kicking you out.
oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
my name's johnny utah!
personal matters.
yeah! we're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! we're gonna score!
read it.
i hope i never get that old.
gee, let me think. "do you want to..." is that the best you can do? some tired hand me down rehash? hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. no movie rights. nothing. i've been through this before and much better i might add.
on the morrow i'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
they do this with impunity!
no, i wanna kill my boss!
thank you, uncle.
listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. it's terrible.
which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
i'd like that.
the painless pole plans to cross the great divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
did your mother see angels often?
hold on.
one too many safes dropped on his head?
how do you do?
must be a spare set.
that'swhati'msayin'.  i'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
no fair, i'm not armed.
ben -- i think -- i think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
frida, listen to yourself. if i said i was a werewolf, would you believe me?
you have to leave -
has caesar ever seen him?
probably not.
say fuck.
you are the wisest person i know.
what's a "little while?"
uh huh. well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, i'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. and furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book i wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the pen award which, by the way, i accepted 'under the influence.'
i've seen it.
"i'll go out with you." now go get me these old newspapers...
at the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. the exercise is good for him.
i just buzzed him in.
ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
it doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
what?!!
look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. you can help me make beds if you like.  come on.
you said speak czech!
yes. john wants it.
no, i'm not.
no, holly's game for anything. holly takes after me.
there's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work.  but what the hell, jack, i guess you deserve it. right's right.
it wasn't- i'll bet you it wasn't. because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
for christ's sake, why?
if that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. you, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
to me, it would mean that you're a liar.  you saw it twice.  once with laura -- oops -- once with me and dick.  we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the fourteenth century.
yah -- i brought her some flowers this morning. she's in the room next to my mom. she's super happy.
how can this be?  you and me at the same time, the exact same thought. it's scary.
no.
you are?
that's his brother.
for the third time, yes.
yes.
what do you mean you know?  he told you he was gonna propose to me?
what must i do?
that's the one.  whatever happened to him?
the guy! the priest! the mummy!
that was beautiful.
it's in the stars.
now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
i should go back.  ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor...
it doesn't mean anything.  it was written before i went out there.  before the ho.
on what? another job?
just some local pinot, you know, then a little burgundy. that old cotes de beaune!
i'm getting a taxi.
where is it?
because i don't feel safe until i get the lights on.
what do you want me to do about it?
look, you guys know how it is. you just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your user knows what's goin' on.
a shark attacked thea and some kids...she's going after it....
all right. good good.  logan i want you right here by the front door. this is the dead bolt key.
what's in it?
i can see your small business ! look at it it's so small.
mark this, come what will of it, i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan.  i'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. i'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
a young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  the inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  she was raped...hundreds of times. when they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
am i mentoring the wrong mentee?
and now 2,000 women want his number.  the guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like rick.
i thought we were against ownership?  i can stay tonight.
thanks.
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
not exactly.  she was found in a canal, disembowelled.  throat cut. blood drained.  the body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
what's going on, claire?
david --
i cannot tell a lie.
no. she asked about the trademark.
yes, you approved it, sir.
baack!
no.
ugh!
bet you like that shit.
it sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  it was a form of chemical castration. we became two more sleepy indians.
i've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  didn't know she owned one.
just relax.
aw, the fucking thing... i mean, the zoo is closed.
what is this place, merlin?
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
why?
drop her a postcard.  any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
are you saying this is illegal?
no.
i wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
well then don't pick it up. you know what's best.
... for the mermaids.
hell, i really hate to hear this. because everything that happens in california seems to get down our way, sooner or later. mostly atlanta. but that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. all we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. they didn't roam around much... but now jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
i myself have yet to be lassoed.
how much, do you think?
she didn't seem herself.  for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  one night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  she took some clothes.
with what?  how am i going to interface with it?  i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
no problemo.
no one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. the rest we just want.
well, darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  i could always give you that.
even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  i'm sorry.
yeah, i guess you're right.
yeah, man. where is your beer?
jesus christ. nurse crupp!  anybody else hurt?
me? no. don't want none either. such bastards, man.
um-mmm. oh nathan, this salad is delish...
harry, what --
addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
why should she? i'm sorry, i have work to do, mr... if you don't mind...
travel...and things.
don't push it.
stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom, i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! you don't deny that. do you?
but i don't understand --
so how's it going with your new roomie? what's her name?
there's hundreds of them.  this must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like luke said.
please. let them stay 'til morning. the militia will not come here, they know you are a hutu with influence.
athos!  i know life means nothing to you at this moment, but i will not let you kill yourself.
she hasn't called you?
it's an interesting story, wendy. many years ago in the late 1800's, james mertin, an irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
maybe. can't really tell yet.
do you want some food?
uh. huh.
i hit her.
vat?
my god, the vice president and the joint chiefs...
what is it?
after dinner, you and i will take shifts throughout the night. i don't want to chance miss anything.
no.
i call it my shower dream.
what a mess.
look, maybe that's him!
snuff it, sir... um... death, i mean, missus... er... i just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
oh, god, was this like an rsvp thing?
helllp!
which one?  let me get the list out.
what do you want?
i'm not coming.
... but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. and it is certainly not cia policy.
jesus christ.
what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist?
make them talk and you got williams, pinky!
her hands and feet were tied.
it's midnight, harry. my glittering raiments are dissolving.
because you think your in love with me?
okay. i'm sorry about that.
no, i'm fine.  i'm...  ... wonderful.  just walking down the street with you again.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
why isn't he moving??
you must be jonah.
you driving her?
maybe we should just kiss.
nice tent.
wait...
thanks.
listen...
if i can.
unwritten rule of the sea.  we don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. ask anybody.
mother, please...
i got a planet check on that bug.  it's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
and then what?
but why come to me?
tempus fugit!
tell me you love me.
hey, sammy, tell this jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
look! i don't feel bad about it. i just feel ill.
won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  looks good though. they found the receipt in his townhouse.  it was pretty smeared but had taupin's father listed as a signatory.
you go fast!
that happened once. people weren't talking about aids then, the way we are now. or safe sex.
i gave up my castles and my lands!
bet.
if you knew, why didn't you say anything?
whatever. that's what sells newspapers.
how 'bout...
shee-it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i'll do, i'll go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?
leave him, he's dead.
nuffin' g. just forget it.
that has nothing to do with it. we've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory.  they will hear that you are living in luxury. he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. and soon the army won't even remember your name.
you learned this in some college course?
are you still following me?
don't worry about it.
julius caesar:  "brutus and cassius, they too are honorable men."  who killed caesar?  twenty, twenty-five senators.  all it takes is one judas, bill - a few people, on the inside, pentagon, cia...
five million dollars?
we could get a million dollars.  we could get it in cash.  i know where it could be gotten.
i hate innocent bystanders.  whine, whine, whine. will he settle?
that's why we're here, sheriff cable. where's the body?
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities. many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home.
listen, i don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
...we own it?
what?
there's just one thing.  what about--
wonderful. uh...
why am i here?
yes, sir.
i found him.
i want to go with you!
yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
hey, chili? look at me.
did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
yeah. because at one time, i didn't think enough.
hmm.
i... um...
i called another friend of mine and he's coming over. will you let him in?
your brother...
i didn't know that.
i see.
no!  cocoa puffs on top -- fruit loops on the bottom.
no one.  your property.  it would prove your case.  why do you think kissinger's taping your calls?  for history.  his word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
oh man...i don't know.  i'm gonna miss being disreputable.
the date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. is that where you and rachel conduct business.
oh, i forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...the fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
a bomb.  at the viaduct. she closes the door, then reappears.
i tell you, i saw them!
can i have the gun?
if you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, rose. not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
the night we met.
so-so, johnny.
he must have known charles pretty well.
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg.
and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you?
i'm fine.
you're just stalling now.
well i just uh, you know...
um, i'm gonna need a bag. if you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
not yet.  they're working on it now.
now danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
honey, she won't d...
the kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. how's that sound?
don't even think that i'm buying that.
no, you'd keep me for yourself. four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
i didn't ask him to come!  it's like i said, thelma, he just loves the chase.
long ago.
well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? but that's all right- after all, i'm responsible for everything that happens here. and it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
i've heard of sugai.  i've also heard of the emperor.  they're both national treasures.  one's a hood.
i know what you mean.  i...
i can't believe you're still here.
a life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those gibsons, baby? ooooh!
on the back street — a green house
no.
hi.
not to mention my men who lost their lives.
marty...
part of being a new yorker.
yah, thanks, stan, it's a pretty -
'cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. i mean, we might be in california next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. and you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  but you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. now i'm in california, 'cause you asked me to come. but you don't really want me there. and i'm stuck in california with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
yes? oh, hello -- sure i got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
i just do what the doctor says, babe.
what are you proposing?
tell him, as far as i'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
not a word. he was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. he must be still on it.
phase two.
is that what you call it?
my dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
i went out to delmar.
no, sir. i'm as good as it gets.
i hope so. i hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
like an angel.
oh.  sorry.
no! i felt sorry for the girl, i wanted to help her!
i just don't want to.
yeah, you're probably right.
senta. we have to ask you to stay in rome.
i agree.
yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
i'm sure we can. this is a new sister, sister betty.
tell me!
what do you mean?
they are gone, louis. death took them. death which you can now destroy...
another sad task. we'll bury her tomorrow.  i think we'd better lock the door for tonight. it will make them less uncomfortable.
so, toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
what?
well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from new york.
great!
took 'em all.
yes.
two years of surgery.  i missed my window.  limped through law school instead.
what are you sure about?
i couldn't. do you know how hard it's been not to call you? i pick up the phone every night. whenever that commercial comes on...
make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
okay, thank you.
why?
she's not a tart.
always in a rush, you are.  all these years i've known you, you could never wait for anything.
don't come that bloody flannel with me. if you're a traveller, i'm bloody twiggy.  and who's he?
please?
no.  no, listen to me here.  i want to know what you're talking about.  you know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
danny, it's not what you think.
daitz hinted it existed. it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
of course they're dead.  they're ghosts.
talk about what, patrick? what is there to talk about?
no.
...no... he's my lover...
is that so important, mrs. brenner? you liking me?
'yew-cheen chef-faw'... my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy.
so do you...been a long day.
a page-break signal.  a period.
yes, max?
no!
no.  i'm fine.
it's going.
if what i've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. clock's ticking. tick-tock...
she's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
how do you think i'm doing?
looks like you have them both on.
quite frankly ... it could have been you.
claire...
following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
that's not mine.
yes. but it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
not often, but it is possible. most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. they don't know how long the shadow really is. they don't know how far away the real limits are standing... they stop out of fear.
i love you. i want to have your baby.
so, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
he knew swann way back.  he says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
...tell me about this case.
ask me?
waiter!
i just want to spend time with them when i'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
yeah.  i just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to england, and i wanted to tell you that i thought your speech was really incredible.
all square, doc.
funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. i guess... i guess it's kind of pathetic.
in german?
no... the closest...
i wanted you to.
i've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
what?
meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route.
i'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
bad people.
<u>nashville</u>...?
bullshit, you're...no.  that's raw... well, if i did, then i'm glad i did.  i, well.  i locked on them.  all on them, nothing on me. all my thoughts are on them.  i'm holding the last thought that i spoke: "now is the time."  they signed, ricky.  it was great. it was fucking great.  it was like they wilted all at once.  no gesture...nothing.  like together. 
let'em try.  i will kill to make this happen.
how the hell do i know about brown & williamson?
i am. have a seat.
whew.
no.
how could it be? i hate africa.
but i'm proud.  i wrote, directed, and starred in it just like orson welles in "citizen kane"!
we didn't miss anything.
do you have a girlfriend?
wendell, i want you to come to work for me.
is there a label on the jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
thank you.
where is he now?
oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
jim belushi...?
...and kopalski.
someone has to do something.
i'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. why don't you all come over? then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
good night kiddo.
my daddy gave me this watch.
what's that?
for christ sake, i said it, i didn't do it.  besides, i don't think they were too offended, do you?
why? it's coming on its own. it doesn't hurt.
i've just started it. my friend gave it to me.
i heard about today.  good job.  i'm all for capital punishment.  why don't you go home and see your family?
yes, mr. gittes.
she came to talk to me...
oooh. sassy. what do you care who feels me up, jake? unless it kinda gotcha going. did it, jake? getcha going?
look at me. i said look at me!
it's a goddamn wild goose chase. remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud?
what's got into that cat?  well if you do see him, tell him i've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
i'll say it is. you spilled a little borscht on it.
you have a dog? what kind?
now he's back.
the one that slept in my mouth last night.
ethan - iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  it can kill you.
must have a sweet tooth. see if you can find some cookies.
oh no, i want to.  i've got a hard-on for you the size of canada... but i don't... want just one night.  i have a confession to make?
and the one driving the other car?
blow me.
excuse me.
they'll come anyway. they love me here.
yeah.  i better get on with my work.
he made a cat.
looks like she was a neuroin addict like john doe here, but i show an address history that includes the beaton clinic.
okay, okay... okay?  i just... you know i hate surprises.
a strange threat. i can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. pity about mr. redfoot.
...and i have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...

thank you.  i only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
we should go to the metro it's quicker.
so what do i do?
it'll be wonderful.  we'll be at peace.  in the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.

he's writing. hello?
okay.
he'll never do it.
bonjour monsieur philipe.
yes you do. we were calling you gay boy and you got so mad....
yes they do, they do, but i'll make my dreams come true, you see?  i will.
he's having a problem here.
too bad.  we'd be out of here in a few hours.
why not? it was getting warm anyway.

that one is my favorite.  chicken puff with shark fin.
who told you to think?!  i don't give you enough information to think!  you do what you're told!!  that's what you do!
hello bud.
ok. ok. let's not fence around ... this is the situation. some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, b58/732 and t47/215.
i can give you many political answers paul but the truth is that africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: french, british, americans.
do? hell, nothing. well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but i'm looking for a silent partner. i've done the research, i've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. i'm just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--i want the dough; i don't take attendance.
one officer already got killed trying to protect me.  please, just take it all away.  leave me alone.

i'll be late.
why should i trust you?
that's all right mr helpmann. glad to help.
...no...
now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
yes, sir.
you're the tribune man?
that's right.  just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  no mistake.  i just hadn't remembered it that way.  up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  that's not all.  once i started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  it was like a game. i would think about a person or a place, or an event.  then i would turn the lights off.  sit down in a comfortable chair...  and study each detail of this subject.
i invented it, man. in my head. it's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-sunday super mutha computer.
she speaks: o, speak again, bright angel!
the pelt is black.  it's a kind of man.
and dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.

do you want the car?
i've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
not really.
with time...you get used to it. besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... then you're happy too.  so i've been wasting my breath? you pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  get out of here! i don't want to lay eyes on you again! this is the last straw! your mother's right, you're crazy!!  but how'd he do it? the little bastard! by watching, he's learned! it's incredible!  i'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! there are no more tickets for you! and i'm also talking to father adelfio! you won't be an altar boy any more either!!! you little runt! 
could we make it to the mountains?
dewey, you and i would never make it.
he's so fine.
why don't you try counting sheep?
john! great to see you! sorry about the cunt at reception.
in my home!  in the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.

you must make the time.  where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
but she doesn't know, about her background.  she never heard of carlotta valdes.

you will protect me as you always have, d'artagnan.
i do hope she enjoys a good show.
no. why should it?
i'm pulling the green wire.
what?  what are you talking about?
i think you have your answer.
what're you doing with all this shit?
no jocks?  a twenty-game winner or a masters champion?  someone i could talk to.  or would talk to me.
i couldn't stay in this place.  i wouldn't.  i'd just pick up, do whatever i had to do, and get out.
the night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- i turned you away.

zerzura, the white city of acacias, the oasis of little birds.  as me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  i can smell it.  the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  i can taste it. i'm chewing the mint.  is there sand in my eyes?  are you cleaning sand from my ears?

it's you who's being hurt. by keeping it inside you, like a poison. sooner or later it's got to come out.
give the man a hug, boy!  that's your father!
then we both are.
shit.
hey, about everything that happened with sarah.  i know you did what you could--

he is.
that settles it! i will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! my nerves are strained to the breaking point!
my name is count d'algout. i telephoned.

i don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
they're just outsiders. they want to see how fine jabez stone lives these days. they're waiting for your guests, too --

i can talk about whoever the fuck i want! you won't even remember what i say! i can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
he asked how you are.
come to my office, miss price.
i tried to grab you -- save you --
i'd hoped i was finished with all that. but... 
you're right.  i don't give a damn about her.  but to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  that just makes a fool out of him.  i don't like being made a fool of.
what was that about?
nonsense!  you look great --  look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  we'll film around you for a while.
i suppose so. though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
she like it rough? you like beatin' on her?

the train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  would you like to hear the silver lining?  check that, gold.  i've been working with john bontecou all along.  we had a game plan -- acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  i set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
you won't be goin' to jail again, will you, daddy?
horses.
that's when we'll do it. and we'll need every single day.
right now i wouldn't be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns.
jeff. sorry. i didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
yeah.
thank you. bye.
fascinating!  tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
why, you don't have to apologize, mr. warne. you'll never know how much i appreciate all this.
jesus.
no. no you're not.
you know,  darling you...you send me...darling you ...you mend me.  honey, sing it for judge tower.
we can't do that, dude.  that fucks up our plan.
evidence of what?
like you, i find it difficult.
there's midrash supporting this. my father read a book by shalom spiegel that -- isaac actually died and was reborn.
always, my dear one, never any further.  love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  a full diet can only kill it.

do what? i don't know. i'm no good at this.
want to go? let's go back in.
come on, bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. it's my money.
not really.
why should i be?
first the supplier couldn't find the invoice. then the order came up short. then i missed the four o'clock plane from cleveland and had to rent a car, and then i got a darn flat tire on the highway! can you beat it? boy, your boss must've been furious when i didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
i'm a human being, i've got some!
at twelve twenty. i know.  lyons two, four, seven, one.  two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!

because you need to understand. and you need... to be careful.
minneapolis.
you don't understand, i can get us information...

simpson?  jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick!
that's why i'm letting you take care of this.  i'm the one with appearances to maintain.  but who gives a shit about you?  not even god.
she cannot possibly refuse.  her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
this?  naw...
why didn't they?--who told them not to?
how hard can it be? i punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
what for?
but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous --
then why'd you ask?
yeah, i did.
halfway 'round the world.  so that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
she didn't give you my address?
who?
what about you?
honesty is always best.
he gave me a code message to insert in the times, in case i wanted to get in touch with him.
jessica was never any good for paul.  you will be, you are.  and mother -- seeing jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  please, betsy -- it's only merciful.
why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. you've broken off negotiations. you did it. you're calling them off. you had nothing on your mind all day, but manchester, -- manchester -- manchester.  you don't suppose for one moment that i'm such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester. 
you'll do more.than that.
so how come you got into all this?
i couldn't help myself.  you get lost inside a women like her.  it was like a drug.  it was the best sex i ever had.
anything else?
that doesn't seem so bad.

i'm sure he isn't. though he's certainly adept at killing.
nineteen!  my dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
it's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie.
is it about a pirate's daughter?
so you're like... struggling superheroes?
too bad.
i wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
her mother. not that it matters because i don't work for you no more. i quit. i just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
well...dammit, if i'm doing this, how the hell am i gonna watch?
going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
oh, ya big lizard!  now we'll never know what it is!
never even heard of anything like it.
thus..... with a kiss...... i die.
vada, vada, what's the matter?
more!  more!
as real as you wish. hot or cold. humid or dry. anything you like. within reason.
just a little... what's the difference?
you asked me if i would --
so you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
i'll warn them.
don't go blamin' yourself...
how do you know she's dead.
this could be bigger than "amos and andy."
yes.
beth shalom? it's reform.
maybe luther hopes ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
take them.
what's the matter... they never housebroke you?
i should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
and what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
i try not to expect you.
i get a little bloated sometimes.
now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. i just carry that. you been listenin' to them cops too much.
you're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
sure!...they <u>were</u> here...now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  we bought this house and i spent the rest on this.  it's the bomb, huh?
i'm calling from professional nurse quarterly...
he's drunk.
i've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage i could raise-
hello.
yes, sir.
i wanted to talk to you,  i wanted to tell you about the other children.
if they are not here, he must have sent them away.
yes.
tell the folks where you are today, donald.
hey, i saw that movie. true story, 'bout some killer in texas.
i admit i may have seen better days, but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
four hundred a week, off the books.
someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
keyser sate or not, if keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
lady.  you've got the wrong man.
they're dying.
give him the money.
i'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
we've still got 36 cases of rum. that's better than money.
beats a lawsuit.
any kind of assignment.  additional dialogue.
if you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
sure you do --
at chet danburry's house.
why young girls, walter?
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens.
sir--
a forced joining of an artery and vein. must've happened when benes was hurt.
goodbye
what do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
i've read of it.
what expenses? all you need is carfare to long island. you'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
she met him at college.
it's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
what's all this got to do with me, mr. bartholomew?
no, not -- i mean have you, you know --
yes.  i mean, i think so.  yes.  yes...
where's your brother?
charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! you hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
you do this -- for friendship?
w'sup, max?
we're ahead of schedule, that's all. you're finding out here what you would have found out in africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
i am on the staff of...
barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
i guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
lucky for him you came by when you did. he might be dead now.
to the best hiding place in the world.
a fucking moron.
everyone, it's woody!
you've done well by yourself.
christ, jack, it's her birthday.
it's a long story.  right now we gotta do somethin'.
there's thousands of units like this one.
yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
it's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
he and his love are like a retiarius.  do you know what a retiarius is?
but you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. no de-fense.
the person i cared about wouldn't have done this. everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. i don't know you at all. for all i know you could hate dorothy parker.
are you, general?
learn your cliches.  study them. know them.  they're your friends.
i missed that one. or, hey, you know who else? morgan freeman. you know morgan?
yeah.
i saw the light. i thought maybe rae had come back to see me. but i never thought it'd be my boy. i never thought that.
we are fighting for a cause much ...
yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
save 'em for the girl in gingham. just tell me i'm not good enough for you. go on. say a woman like me can't change.
no, you don't.... if you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. you know what tefillin is? tsitsis? shotness? you know the kaddish from the kiddush?  eichmann? he went to israel. he studied the torah, the talmud, the mishnah, the whole bit. he hated jews.
he's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
you just can't stop editing me. huh?
what?
regula i is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
no thank you.
shit.
we argued on sunday. he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. but on thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. didn't call either. not till saturday afternoon.
i'm on my way to chicago. very important meeting tonight. well -- any new developments?
the timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
you were never a kid.
oh.
he's in bed!  you're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  he comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
what's your first move?
it's a bachelor party. you sort of have to do it before the wedding.
oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. they try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  it's no big deal, chase. i did it when i was young.
what's not right?
right. the sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
we're on sublevel six.  we'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
sure have, sam.
what you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
yes... you will wait.
just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
aw, cut it out, ruth.
take a hike.  am-scray.
maybe i did... try new orleans first... lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
i'm doing a favor for heather. a double date. i tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
probably not.
...then what about...
it's crazy, but i don't really know, i mean i haven't written anything but "misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. maybe you can come up with a title.
no...
forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
he won't be looking for you.  just be careful.  buy a book.  keep your sunglasses on.
you're weird and i'm afraid of you. seriously, cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
didn't you forget something?
was he with anyone?
not at all, huh?!... let's go to the hotel. and if you're lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
what if i told you he did this to me?
wait!  how are you going to know they're all following it?
i'm only walking him.  you caught him.  you have to be exhausted.
probably must be.
well thank you for the offer,  but i really have to go.
a letter? may i see it?
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
he killed her.  i'm not crazy.  he killed her and--
and who do i go to about you?
sometimes 76 or 80. sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning. eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar. why?
just serve.
i need to confess.
no. i want to know what you think about besides ditching smokey?
they spurred onto high ground, my lord, full of spirit and looking for the zulu. full of sport they were, my lord.
i probably meant it when i said it.  doesn't lucky chuckie want to come out?
oh! ho! okay. you wanna go?
what do you mean?
show me just agatha's data stream.
j.d.? you seem pretty amused. i thought you were giving up on high school guys.
what's the matter with you?
drew called from the astar, they're still two minutes away.
you remind me so much of nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
it's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  want an eskimo pie? or a creamsicle? i'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. i'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
okay.  so how is jessica?  you talked to her lately?
you stay with mrs. silvera, tootsie. okay?
you are what...?
we love it. i only wanted to prepare you.
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
can you get us a line?
that's a direct order. you didn't see a thing!
i don't trust anybody. you see how bad this guy wants vig? it's like a sickness. i say we collar vig ourselves. we got vig, then we got leverage. and we trade; vig for that tape. i want to see it right in front of my face.
two-thirty.  that gives me time to see my boy.
just stay down.
boy, i knew you'd be discouraging.
yep.
that won't work, chick. this boy's honest, not stupid.
i told you already... i'm here to set you free...
oh, absolutely.  bruce and i are very close.
i don't have a phone.
there's no such thing as an accident, nicole.  not in a situation like this.
then i think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
why would you want me to kill you?
everyone describes the same process. at first it is exciting.  you're at the centre of the world.  as soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  and there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  your a clerk in a rather dowdy office.  there's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  you're a processor of semi-official news.  some people leave at this stage.  then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  you're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  professionalism.
i didn't do anything --
what's that, mrs. mulwray?
sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
what do you mean? they're sending someone from rome?
twenty! what did he do with them?
i know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
well, one was for salad...
yes, excuse me for a second.
tell him his country is very beautiful.  tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
aaauuuhhh!!!
to the bastille.  and death.
a room... there is a room, and i sit there alone... always alone...
what do we do?
try, kelly.
yes, yes, yes.  i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea. we'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
i still don't...
well, let's not exaggerate. i take pictures. you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. no need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
oh joe, be happy for us. i'll pay you the twenty thousand.
our chance to do what?
well, i'm sure it's not christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... i know it's not new years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and i'm sure it's not our anniversary, because i didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'pick out something pretty'... yes -- maurice -- i'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
the word is sick.  ted -- very, very, very sick.
does she, goddamnit??
<i>i forgot.</i>
maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
no...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. i'll meet you on the far side.
where do you live?
it's not us, they were scared before we got there.  what do we know?
eh... police.
i think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
please... wait.
yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
well... thank you.
what is it? what do you see?!
maybe different.  i don't know, ellen.
you know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
yes... probably he was renewed?
are you've seen it work cures?
still makin' jokes?
you've got the schematics, check.
what's the matter with you?  so the piano's a little out of tune.  so what?
then you went freelance?
yes.
soon, but first i must bless this house.
he's very excited about it.
what's the matter with you all? have you lost your sense of humour?
why not?
is silent.  motionless.  he gently closes wade's eyes.  his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags.  he fumbles and drops it. sarge notices.
ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
oh my god!
it is hard to say. six months, at least. perhaps a year. it depends to a certain extent on him.
no, thanks. i manage very well.  i'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 c tomorrow.
thirty years. maybe more.
and we will begin with tearing it down.
michael, take deep breaths.
and so explain it away?  but there is a way to explain it, you see. if i'm mad? that would explain it, wouldn't it?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket, i want you home...
the woman you met, lauren.  she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  the real drug was shipped out of the country. the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
get in, mom! i have to open.
and if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak german.
she works at a church?
and i have no desire to hurt you. you will always be beautiful. think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
he just gave me his "monster" speech.
when he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
her or me?
why not?
really biff? the keenest?
by the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
yeah.
-- your act only works with an audience.
i thought so. come on, i'm in a hurry.
and then...
get us one.
no. no good.
he's a good soldier, jude.
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met--
how about that pose?  this is not fun...  give me some direction.
you're *trespassin'*! it ain't you lan' no more! an' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
in private, if you don't mind...
okay barton, you're the artist, i'm just the ten percenter. you decide what you want and i'll make it happen. i'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath.
what the hell does that mean?
jezuz christ!
officer, i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody?
oh, it's you!  you got a lot of nerve -
we don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  you have <u>my</u> respect. have you discussed the note with dr. hudson?
who is it this time--my mother?
oh-kay...
tht was summation, your h...
she's crying.
no dollar.
congratulations, jerry.
it's an animal urge, puff. it's nothing to be ashamed of.
yes you have. you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
most kids never have it happen.
then do it.  i need you on this kelly. do it tonight.  we'll figure something out... okay?
because i didn't want to be touched! i didn't think you'd get that!
don't let me go!
you'd die for fun?
yeah...
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, i'd go to hell to do it.
well, you hire illegals--
nice try, mulder.
i saw the bogyman. i saw him outside.
shut the fuck up.  ricky.  you have a mean streak in you...  and what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
i don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, diz. it's these clouts below the belt i can't take. sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
that's terrific.  that's really terrific, but i notice i'm the one that's cleaning up this--  oh, crap, i'll have to do this one over.
she didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
you haven't heard me yet.
i don't want to play.
hell, yeah... it's a beautiful business ...  i mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
right.
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room. i have ordered champagne. perhaps the baroness could join us.
i didn't think so.
campaign manager? waldrip.
this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.
damn if i won't.
may i ask what this is regarding?
exactly what do you have in mind, mr. corrigan.
gay?
big time.
he's the opposite of you.  he's more like me.  cold, calculating.
i was just kidding around.
and they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  ah... then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
would you be prepared to handle this for me?
yeah, i guess.
yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
are you jealous? i thought you said you didn't care what he did.
what?!
twice.
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off, i ran in, childs shot me, pike and mueller were dead, and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
yeah, well, why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous -
you meant it.
oh, please...
i don't know. bank teller. sounds like ladies work to me.
i really don't know what to say
i ain't got no fuckin' ring.
my man's coming to get my ass out of here. that's good enough for me.
i wonder who'll recognize us first? they'll wet their pants.
we all did.
yes.
the jewboy's a harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
tonight's the night.
really?
wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
but you're not.  you're somewhere else.  you're someone else --
very likely. you're not exactly catching us at our best.
it was lovely!
sheriff? i'm doctor sam loomis.
so where's that leave us?
i'll call you.
my oath of celibacy is on record captain. may i assume my duties?
i'm gonna call the police then, sir.
well what?
do i look like i live in a bottle?
thanks for the message.
when you're annoying as hell, i care a lot.
not lately.
no --
she won't?  why not?
you.
you can't just abandon me.  alone.
real diamonds.  they must be worth their weight in gold.  are you always this generous?
the crowd is really with the movie. some even talk to the screen. "you dumb bitch. get out of the house." etc.
i'm sure. just don't forget what they did to us.  we'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the federation holo-ship any more. just get the holding cells ready.
ha!!
such as what womanly things?
just say "i swear i won't kill anyone."
made me give you the eye and then panic,
denham! go back to the wall ... tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with ann!
someone blew the whistle.  someone hates me.
look, now, charlie, give me a big laugh here.
i would have made you immortal.  tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare.
there aren't any little boys on your floor.
peg leg?
what would you do for me?
blood. looks like arterial spray.
special effects?
he does...?
why would someone do that?
i'm just doing some christmas shopping. it's for my wife, no kidding. though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
ok.
are yuh?
blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  why are you bothering me with this... ?
the rangers and dea are heading out to the desert this morning. you gonna join 'em?
was rose.
you think he might be missing?
that's a strange question.  you a strange man?
my dear mozart, there is no one in the world i would rather help, but now it is too late.
fuck you.
i need someone with your kind of background.
i can try.
yes, one and a half please.
well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'just win, baby'.
federation support, federation procedures, federation rules... look in the mirror, admiral... the federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the borg, the cardassians, the dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the federation. that's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear federation new life. well, how badly do you want it, admiral? because there are hard choices to be made now. if the enterprise gets through with news about their brave captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless ba'ku, your federation politicians will waver, your federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your federation allies will want their say... need i go on?
you quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
yep! the walls of jericho. 
so you're gonna bitch up?
he's writing his name in water.
i'venever understood you, you know that? you were by far the best pupil i've ever had, bar none. intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. nothing would surprise me about you jacob. nothing.
i... just knew. a husband knows.
give that back to me.
and you can? power it up?
i know.
listen to you.
you get to know each other pretty well out there.
excuse me?
why?
well, i made it through another night.
well, we'll see about that... hey, lookie.
what's the bible for?
listen, what's your name?
beautiful. sad. she died!
keep trying.
good. i'm good.  did you finish that paper for worth's class yet?
whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
i'm staying pregnant, le.
well, what's your idea of love? chains?
touchy, touchy.
who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
if it has to be--do you mind if i do it myself?  oh, i don't mean with the gun. this is no trick.  when i wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  it's not so hard for me as you think. i'm not crying about it, i've been skating close to it for quite some time.  the water is cold down there--  but so is everything else.  and there's you.
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
just when we have all the cards, vaughn.  take these two behind the van.
no, no, no, no. we must leave.
yes, jackie shawn, my wi -- felicia.
did you hide the letters?
claudia, you torture yourself.
alvy.
recommendations?
i suppose we might catch them off their guard.
i will.  but isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
n-no...i mean...you bet.
precisely. we are the true entrepreneurs, and prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. america is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of little italy.
i don't know. he's a hairdresser.
how?
it was freddy.
right now, son.
agnes, did you love your mother?
germs?!
we're going home.  we're going home together...
if there was, i didn't see it...
i know you wouldn't need leon if heidi was treating you right.  the thing i don't understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway?  you got two kids on welfare now.  what're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
right.
we didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
we should have gone to nassau. at least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
dammit, it doesn't add up!  ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald's return.  only intelligence people can come and go like that.
i suppose so.
no, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
king david.
but, nick... hey, i mean, where would a guy like merle get money like this?
i won't be back. i've requested the atlanta run.
you got to be kidding me.
so, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
this is how you play god.
okay, dad.
it was on the tv.
i'm sure they were exaggerating.
i changed my mind, early. i'm not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you... i decided. i think your mean, and you hurt people.
no, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
it's not the same thing, is it?
no - i've got a sweet-payin' job that i'm about to lose.
um, hi, i'm ted peloquin. i'm here to take mary to the prom.
is this your dad?
nothing.. but stay within a quarter mile...i've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  if he comes back i'll hear him.  you'll have time to get up.
a girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  what's new and hot in gotham city?
i don't think you realize how serious this is uncle.
what you been up to?
don't i always?  most of the time?
oh, yeah... man, i'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
me neither...but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches.
surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  and beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. when they're in trouble, it's always their girl friday who gets them out of it.
fine, fine, at a later date, i'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. but for now, i'm drilling inside your brains...i bring up the whole catwoman thing for one reason.  i bit captain god in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
keep them alive.
you're gonna be singing for st. peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
well - i'm a little confused.  this is a charge receipt from rosen's drug store where mr. marsh had an account.  it's dated the day of the murder.  is this your signature?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. figured you'd know something about that, wade.
noted.  thank you.   miss costello was a rebuttal witness.  her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
the big job.
the ottos always waited for the bus with bear.  they were the only parents who did that, together like that.  i guess they're what you might call hippies.
yah, no, i'm sure you are. shep vouched for you and all. i got every confidence in you fellas.
for god's sake, mrs. robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. you give me a drink. you put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
how was i supposed to know they were women?  besides one of them was bald and kept saying "soitinly."
i am not concerned, mr. harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. i consider that to be your business -- not mine.
probably.
oh yes you will wear garters—
got it.
yes.
you didn't know about it before that?
that's okay, rok.
hello, edie.
good heavens!  whatever?  has she died of grief?
going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society, and they got her.
she left.
like seven-fifty. seven hundred fifty?
we're doing episode 31, jason?
he's going to south america to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
early grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
not particularly.
i've struck the mother-lode.  i'm counting... spade work....
well, i can't really blame you -- not now.
loretta.
don't make me have to use this.
you're going sailing.
only to myself.
okay.
we had nothing to do with that riot. that riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
yeah. doctor malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. says it's helping to bring her out.
you wanna get up? well, you've gotta you see... well i want you to lick it. go on... lick it. alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
an abortion, stupid.  i had an abortion the day before yesterday. so you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  bye-bye, baby!
chocolate?
yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. i've made a lot of sacrifices for you, juno. and in a couple years you're going to move out -- and i'm getting weimaraners.
shhh...
hell with him then. if he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
don't play bullshit games with me.
that's so bullshit. this is so bullshit.
okay, i suppose i should go home.
you don't have an investigation without me.  you got that?
it's not me, it's dark here... and i can't find the switch.
sue ann, i'm sorry about all this, but i just know there's something special out there for me...
dad's here.
for what?
i didn't?
i'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
oh - and what's so stinking about it?
you a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
i've seen 'em.
this is new york. no one notices anyone. not even when someone disappears. at first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal mccay's jag. then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. the old man got such a rush from it, i thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
i'm trying to find out.  she was a runaway.  i'm looking into it for her parents.
tomorrow's saturday.  anyway, she's dead.
it violates so many trusts.
she is very young -- i have an old habit of failure. it would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
it's totally out of context.  i was protecting the national security.  i never intended --
what are you gonna do? fight with him?  he wants his money.
she didn't. that's about all she said. put your hand up. good. i think she still loves you. take a breath and let it out.
no more shines, billy.
i gave it to you.
well... yes... i had a trailer. it's not like i made him run along side of the car.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
he's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
she's not all that homely, mister mcmurphy. in fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
i want to have the session. i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me. but i guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
it's a ketch kelly and i had chartered.
in a dictatorship, art belongs to the party. if you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
i want to be the way i was before.
she'll be with you soon.  they're pulling up.  they'll realize i kept my part of the bargain.
have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
it's your own fear troubles you... we're here, aren't we?  for all the dark magic protecting it.
tonight. let's get together.
did you have any indication of this from georgi? any possible warning or sense of motivation?
you rich kids... are all the same !
turn that thing off.
he's too important, james.  they'll set the army on you. you and your wife.
look at you, not even breaking a sweat. you're cool, boy.  you're cool.
not you my dear.
i don't think she knows.
to reach people, you have to feel something first... you write about the wrong things.  how can you feel for dog food?  the people at the gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
i have acted as i think fit.
well i'm certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
yes, madame colet?
well, if i couldn't be a good putterer, i wouldn't want to putter. but why? what makes you think i couldn't be a good putterer?
you know so much about the middle east, you know where we can get something to eat.
ahh, now we're getting down to it. it's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
forget the bumbling americans, they will be like all the others. without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find hamunaptra?
why, craig. why?
no.
no, of course not, silly -- i mean felt like this about them?
yeah. i'm fine. it didn't hurt.
exactly.
oh no, mr. merrick. no. no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
and director.
go on -- shoot me!
i'm staying with the countess.
sign up.
i trust you.
what about relatives?
cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
you know, if anyone else told me that, i'd have serious doubts.  but coming from you, i can't honestly say i'm surprised.
can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? i've done my best. i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts. he got a fee - what i could afford. can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
yes i know.
well, comrade, have you heard from your friends kopalski, buljanoff, and iranoff?
no.  never heard of him.
who is she?
they'll know about it in the morning.
i know ben.
a cop?  you want me to trust a cop?!
uhh...
that's very sweet of you, mr. roth.
that's not a piano.....i have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
accelerators down.
but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  and she never showed up so they couldn't see her. it's a very symbolic thing happening. she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
two hundred and seventy.
buzzing?
hello summer detention.
don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
recognizers!
relax, will you.
the hell is that?  what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
rock?
what?
then what is the...?
they're forged.
what?
i remember when you was a little girl marie. you come back from the movies and you'd say - mama that ending was so sad... and i'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood.  and you believed me.
they've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of god's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. so please -- do it.
i didn't say anything?
well, i'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  you wanna change this subject, you better have a war.  what do you need?  it's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  okay?  what do you need in an enemy?  somebody you fear.  who do you fear? som'b'y you don't know.
you'll have to find that out, won't you?--
i don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
well, he's spitting on my neck! you know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
people have to tell me these things. i've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  ok, no problem. here's my second plan. back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth, which we scientists call the "ozone layer." slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. that is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
how?
no they won't.
be careful, conner.
well, that's why they paid so well.
it's the darndest thing. ed knew what they were immediately. as a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
he ikea'd us.
hmm.
including you?
brindisi versus electric boat.
fine. but we're not going to let you do your job. because we're gonna do it. and then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
you were the only sullivan in the phone book.
ok. thank you.
steven schwimmer. the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan.
hello, miss ilsa. i never expected to see you again.
and your wife left you.
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
right around here, in the food court.
what, you gonna shoot me now, bo?
what do you chant?
jesus, you're caustic.
not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  so if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a section eight, do you tell your men?  of course not.  you bluff, you lie.
ok, ok, so what's the point you're trying to make?
no, actually. i don't know how to put this really. well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  have you figured out what i'm doing?
i don't know you at all. bud permit me -- c.c. baxter -- junior executive, arthur murray graduate, lover.
only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  all i know is i woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
that's good.  judges like adopted indian boys.  tell me more about the ottos.
touch some deer feces out in the forest. eat a sandwich without washing your hands. then you got lyme disease.
you were asleep.
what the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
so, you see?  we're friends now, guys.  aren't we, buzz?  you bet.  gimme a hug.
what?
look, the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them. which is what i have to appear to be doing. so i give them something they already know. you.
i doubt that.  good day, miss cartwright.
are you asking me on a date?
no.  no.  he didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
is that a threat?
what's wrong, mary?
would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists i am calling together?. perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
that stuff about the mig. i was out of line.
creasy. pinta likes him.
door's locked.
didn't this "information" come from the joe boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you shu kai kim, a korean, an outsider?
i apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  disaster...
i don't know - it's a big apartment. but i wasn't interviewed.  in fact, i was totally unprepared for what happened.
no.
ah, but, we're asking about you.
ouch!  something's biting me.
jeffrey.  projectile vomit.
thanks. i thought you weren't gonna ...
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washington's cabinet.
what, sebastian?
low on gas.  got to refill.
well, if it ain't tom joad. how ya, boy?
which way do you want to go?
yes.
it's large enough...
well, that even surprised ole moses at fust. i didn't think the board was that smart.
is there one in these waters?
let's hit it.
no?
the boy in the well.  how did you know that was just a hoax?
i told her it was the fuck of the century.
you must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
i told you it wasn't no jive.
no.  i'm just a little tired.
no, thanks--i'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
bob. i must ask you to shut the fuck up. did andrew beckett say "i might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" he said nothing. and now, andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, philadelphia, judicial establishment. my god.
better today than tomorrow.
you're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, joey?
detective.  nice of you to come down here.  seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  jesus, what's up with your eye?
darling, my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it. and the police'll catch him without my help.
y-yes my son.
pull over.
well if i was looking for a victim, i definitely wouldn't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would i ask for ransom? you??
slow down there, honey... i don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
ow!
you're damn right i do.
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... there are no buses on this street.
exactly.  we'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  it would cause the line to buckle. then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
there must be some way.
i know everything about you, diana.
very nice.  i'll take it.
to tell you the truth, not very much. i cannot lie. i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
no, but i know what he means.
oh, yes.
your father is frantic with worry. our mission was to rescue you and return home.  that is what we shall do.  mr. turner's fate is regrettable.  but so was his decision to engage in piracy.
you're going back to the forbidden zone?
what if we just fucked with 'em?
why won't you talk to me?
five.  three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation.  killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
entert-ain...us...an-us...oh yeah! heh heh. anus. heh heh.
he won't. he thinks i'm simple.
not this time! it was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. and do you know who he was, children?
i'm not in danger.  i have a dead bolt. remember?
yes ... yes. the problem also involves the un. i don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength.
do they show intelligence?  with the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
i opened the present you got me from harrison's.
pervert! what are you talking about?
if you'll just maybe ease it into second.
meet me tratino's at nine.
his heart's beating.
she'll come, pard. a rich socialite oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
and nobody knows you're a virgin!  aw, who are we kidding...
...well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. there was nothing left to mortgage; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway...
i'll be right here...just in case.
but where would we go?
before your time. it was richard low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. the behavioral sciences unit at quantico is essentially the product of three men: david koessler, dick low and myself. low was a field agent, koessler administrative, i was teaching criminology. low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. he invented profiling. everything we know about profiling started with richard low...
that's good enough for me.  you better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  you two have to stick together now.  boners united.  united in getting some.
perhaps not.  perhaps we can all use... a little spandex.
i can take care of myself. don't worry.
can i lend you a hand?
what's happening?
by pulling my hair?!
fine piece of engineering.
it's good to see you, holly.
i don't care who he is. he doesn't know.	he can't tell ——
what are you doing here?
i want to see my wife and kid.
get out.  the evil finger's on you. get out!
i told him you looked like me.
uh-oh.
go on, beat it!
come on, charlie. we got business.
uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when i touch you.
i had to.  you made me.
pow!  what!  kazow!
oh, yeah.
of course.  don't you?
yes, general formica.  carry on, my good man!  i don't know what we would do without you.
never heard of it.  it's got no day or date.  hell, it ain't even got numbers.  what's the matter?  you couldn't afford a timex?
can you protect me?
you try that you little monkey.
and you're certain you can find the way back? even in the dark?
where's the bag she gave you?
thank you.
most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. i realize you're very lucky to be alive agent scully. the ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department. until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
no, we're all right. thanks anyway, tommy.
and his baggage?
is who down there?
i am arthur, king of the britons.
is he in the bathroom?
yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to mexico to work in the sweatshops.
i'm sorry. here. this'll pay for a course in karate.
what about one guy with two guns?
you work for the <i>new york times</i>. your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
thank god.
no, in person.  now.
all you are is a professional ass-kisser.
no. no one never did.
we're almost there, lib.  step on it.
they don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  a good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  a bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  you said that once, remember?
yeah.  a lot of guns.
i understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. i'm not that skilled as president. oh sure, i put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
blue eyes, yes, sir.
it's okay.
yeah.
they will surely kill us here. it's over here. we have to take the chance.
great.
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow?
we're nuns!
what do you mean? who can buy this kind of equipment.
remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? more beautiful than any church i was ever in.
not bad.  $20.  here, $5.
what?
stick with me, kid.
i left him because every time i looked at him, i saw my son.  every time i got close to him, i smelled my little boy.  that's why i left him.  and now you can leave.
this morning was good.
you're getting ahead of yourself. we're all in this together. we're all cbs. we'll find out soon. thank you, gentlemen.
i don't know. motel... abby--
okay. let's go shopping.
what we need... is richard yellow bird.
someone who's sick of living off scraps. the coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  when the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
what did you say your name was -- pinkus?
one thing i don't need is heckling! you called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
even?
what would she do that made it hard to resist?
i told you. these murders are not normal.
yeah, i guess so.
whatever for?
now you want arizona dollars.
they wouldn't be a bit surprised..
i think we gotta kiss now.
yes.
i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland--
isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
not mouse, never mouse! if anything - rat!
that's amazing. i-i-i... i've been goin' for fifteen years, i-you know, i don't got... nothing like that in-
great.
i just don't know if this says, "me". what's the fabric?
still -- those witnesses.
-- that's the fact, bud --
no!  andy, don't do it --
which one?
besides.  i've been starting point the last two years.  ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
those years stretch as the years go on. i've seen it happen too often.
didn't i? that's funny. isn't it funny?
go!
but "nice".
anything!
you shouldn't start now.
we've got six hours left.
ninety-two.  course half hour from now might be seventy-two. these clouds move around a lot.
all right. what happened to our bracelet?
look, maybe i'd better take my car --
just good luck.
i think you better sit down.
uh -- what?
sure. it's fine. as long as you don't snore.
now what's he know about garbage, huh?
yesterday yes, today no.  what happened last night?
i though it was... very musical, and i liked it a lot.
i hear you're a good thief.
you're going to <u>do</u> that?
tonight? jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
okay, i guess.
now some people, we both know them, al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  but a man doesn't cry.  i don't cry.  you don't cry ... you fight!
attention all units. we've got him. he's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
i don't know. i'm pretty familiar with the school and i've never seen that "x". but... i do know something.
we missed you in church today, frank.
uh... halloween. you know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. what's yours?
due to the fact that you retained the residence, ms. bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
alright. you have my attention, rose. can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
satisfied?
good, well ask him if arabic is his second language.
i don't know.  he was shot and killed when i was fourteen on the steps of his church in bethesda.
i guess you know just about everything, don't you, lance?
sedate her.
so what's it going to be?
okay, but if i get yelled at, i'm never gonna listen to this show again.
oh, sorry. detail i guess i forgot to mention. you die, you lose. your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... i mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
you look upset.
you can't make me.
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory. see if he remembers anything new the next day. and i'll have the test results back in a few days.
yes.
there is no privacy in russia. this whole thing seems very suspicious. what's the real reason? if you ever want to get into russia, take my advice... confess!
yes, sir.
i don't like nobody behind my back!
is that what you want?
they all lead to the same place -- the lungs.
who the fuck is doing this?
... you have a little... uh... something on your face...
i don't know, john...i mean, to be brutally honest, i'm not so sure what kind of mental shape joanna's in right now.  y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
if that's all you got, that's all we got left.
buggin' out, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your poopie suits!
we keep going, that's what we do.  we ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
oh, god, that's too much responsibility for me.  it's not fair!  i want a less complicated life, frederick.  i want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
daniel burdon, fbi.
i know.
merci!
texaco... what's wrong with that?
repeat. we need help. sos. calling all cars! we need help at the united nations tav--!
albania, albania, albania, james bond villains.
come on, delly, look at the country today.  we're fighting communists in korea, we're paranoid about the russians, we've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  you think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the american public with party propaganda like, gosh i don't know, "sand pirates of the sahara?"
yeah, hold on.
get a good picture in your mind.
what happened to my dad??
grant, no!
but why? why would she do that? she's supposed to marry the guy!
so why pick me?
accounting, david, chartered accounting --
yes, yes he did.
with what?
just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. it's nearly bedtime.
i had to get back to the desert. i made a promise.  the rest meant nothing to me.
well, i guess that's all till tomorrow.
yes. ceiling. why did you run away?
do you love your father?
i'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. and i was wondering, because i know you're a very moral person, and --
tell me...
what's happening here?  you're dead!
it is cocktail hour yet?
...people who don't mind their own business.
one is in a museum!
the massive fellow... brom.  for someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
i don't know... you think the knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
hey to bluestar, as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad...
pornos?
i had the worst goddamn nightmare.
calm down, benjamin.
ten-four.  don't go. not this time.
you'll take a cut of what i make, won't ya?
television?
walter, listen, i'm at my place, i need you to come pick me up--
it's what eddie wants. he, uh, told me to give you some money.
i don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
uh...
you're going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you.
goddamn right i did.  i asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  what's the point in having a speech if i have to ad-lib?
i hope this was made with egg whites!
he wasn't out when you were there. he just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. this fellow lives like a hermit...
sure thing, mr. karpf. c'mon.
you didn't ask.  have you ever thought about mousse?
but why me?... ask claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
to get out of southport?
before i took the story and closed the case, i'd want to know a lot more about these people.  i'd want to know just about everything about them.
well, if it's a real mourning ring,. i'm going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish.
a mistake?
uh, yes..
get in the car.
...who <u>are</u> you?  who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
what're you trying to do?  wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
no. we have to try. we'll figure something out. and if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. deal?  shake a paw?
we can do that.
isn't there an escape pod on this ship? something?
it's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
we’re alright.
jeffrey nothing.
where?
good idea.  marko.  we're hungry.
what did you do to your hair?
michael - i'm sorry...  just give me -
do you have any friends, man?
come on, shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
107  continued:
okay, we won't.  we'll just have fun, all agreed?
no, we'd never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
in any event, you still owe me my reward.
listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. you can't tell a soul. promise?
i hesitated taking that much.
yeah?
dolores?
what are you excited about? you missed the bus, too.
is that what this is about? material wealth?
because you weren't wasting my time.
was this girl from starliner towers?
put your arms around my neck. lock your legs around my waist.
i'm with the band.  i'm the lead singer.
yes?
yeah.
i can't lose more than a hundred.
he was i.a.  he probably asked her about it.
just this minute.  i'm wyatt earp, these're my brothers-
our exec and science officer...
that's her.
uh-huh.  well, i still jerk off manually.
yeah. what's buddy-boy done for us lately?
it's nuwanda.
i'm serious. we forget he's just a child. i wish you'd speak to him.
i'm gonna slit my wrists.  cut my throat.  for the love of joseph.
don't bother. go to bed and get some sleep. i'll be working late.  i can hear any movement down here.
listen.  understand.  that terminator is out there.  it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. ever.  until you are dead.
don't insult me. get up and turn around.
orson wells?  what about doctor lizardo?
i don't.  patrick doesn't.  and his brother and sister don't.  and they're in the house with him.
yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
well, that's very kind of you -- only i'm not feeling well -- you see, i have this cold -- and i thought i'd go straight home.
i was <u>slumming it</u>!  i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
no, i know i don't want it cleaned. get out of here.
six.
i was just asking. no disrespect intended.
how do you know he's still not here?
the guy we're doing? he's disappeared from the map. i can't find him anywhere.
you thought it was just.
do you want some advice?
you underestimate the power of the dark side. if you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
still got your sense of humour.
you switched the charts; you tell me.
okay.
i moved the couch. that's all.
aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
none as far as i know.
are you married?
what mission?
i can't leave now.  we taking sean out?
you can't escape from me that easily. i'm afraid you don't know who i am.
anyone got another set of sails?
bring on all the motherfuckers! bring their college degrees in here! i got nuthin' to hide.  they can't buy me.  you can't buy me.  i don't even need the parole.  this is about the truth coming out.  you're a goddamn liberal, mr. garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  fascism is here now, facism is...
mister radio raheem, i can't even hear myself think.  you are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
dang, you are right, mr rothstein, i am so sorry.
street cats?
we're going for the stronghold.
no you don't know who stole it. just let me do the thinking.
i was.
no.  they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
where is he?
we'll all go crazy...
to the bathroom.
ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  if you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
stepmother.  she's out torturing the movers.
you can't.  counter's at 10 minutes. you don't have time.
you will regret this.
it's fine.
really?
hi. this is nikki. leave a message. 
i know, ma, but -- suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
a yert.  ruth is a living legend, rex. at a time when most women are in boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in montana. in a yert.
there was a review.
one thing i've learned as
no. that wasn't the deal.
oh, i was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;shelly two backs&quot;. all my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones i had.
who cares?
well, that sounds fine to me.
who do you know who can? where do we go?
no.
they're working together, too.
i just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
think we should get up a search party, head in there?
cancer?
i fear our meeting is long overdue... napoleon.
uh, vince.  sorry.  this won't wait.
no.  she'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
nothing further, your honor.
a mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. it's eleven now.  they're leaving. beat.
and i assure you, you do not in fact i'd be obliged for your best advice. what have your scouts seen?
they have done...nothing...they are my people...
oh... i feel a little... oh...
no more drapes to hang.  now what should we do?
do you always ask so many questions?
it would erase all our knowledge of it.  all of our power.
what?
only if i want something bad enough.
it's on the table, dad.
she'll rub it on me - and i'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
... no, no, no...
some people do it for the money
thank you.
and what is your profession?
harry!
i quite liked it.  i wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
no, they won't -
jesus.  jack, that's a story. 'swish actor gets the gay blade.' let me get my camera.
miss marsh.
you won't even try?
then why don’t you reach him?
what can be done has been done.
stop crowdin the plate!
ok, get in.
don't keep calling me that. it puts me at such a distance. i was not born a court composer, you know. i'm from a small town, just like your husband.
yeah, i'm here. i just don't like the anonymous crap. it means your either chickenshit or not for real.
and you?  still a pig.  just a much fatter one.
it better not be my aunt trudy.
she's a commie pig. we're going to nail every last one...
will there be anything else?
-- it wasn't me.
well, i had a good time up to a point.
this is jason's fault!
what do you expect me to do, thank him?
i like a place with lots of life.
we need you too!
commander.
i know...
i'd like some tea, please.
you've earned it -- the horse ranch on the toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
oh won't i?
brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. the smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
is that all you say?
... i get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --i get this expert doctor to talk to you.  i'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  you're 'sposed to be in court.  i bet you haven't even seen the file.
hard to say.  it may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  that's if she exists, of course.
give me a break, alex.  what are we going to tell them?  excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  i'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
no you can't kenny!
i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley.  got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times.  i also found a record of your restraining order.
i'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  we've had some problems.
nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
we are.
i love you! 1 want to marry you!
please -- let me handle this. okay, ruth, forget kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
did i tell you?  did you listen to me?  oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  no, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  the names you called me.  well, don't say i didn't tell you.
with him.  fifteen stiffgasse.
why do you come to me?  why don't you go to a travel agent?
r.k. maroon.
let's move out!
exactly room-mates.
why?
what do you mean?
i want to see what they read so i'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. there's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
what pictures?
that's not right.
why, mrs. brenner?
hey, i was senior. it's ok. this is why i get the big bucks.
yeah.  two hours.
i am so sorry, mr. henslowe. i wanted to be an actor.  i am sorry, will.
bundy.  that's the last one in your speech...
i don't want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
this isn't funny, it's twisted.
your big speech?
why??  i... i attend every year.
then lets go back while we still can.
why are the shutters closed?
do you have to do that?
hi, naomi, it's joel.
triad, chinese mafia. they bring people from yunan. slave labor...  reverend harry wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. no sign of him.
<u>wildlife</u> footage, for god's sake. i don't see how he could've slipped you something that the fbi would be interested in.
i want to do something <u>positive</u>...
what room have you got?
zack, we've got to go.
we'll be there.
hector.
as a matter of fact--i am home.
why, the chairman presides at the meetings.
you shoot on my order.  if he charges, i'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  and drive fast, they can move on land.  you set?
even if i end up going to jail....
michael!!
well, shit-fire, kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
'cause they got rid of johnson. he knew how to deal with the assholes. dallas green, please...
well, you had it down cold. watching you in the movie, if i didn't know better i'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. even the fink part. i never met a fink and i hope to god i never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
i think i kind of lost it. i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'didn't know i even cared about that stuff.
what do you mean?
why are you laughing?
you're not serious.
bein' my partner. i'm headin' north up around the niobrara in nebraska. gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
i don't know.  i'm sorry...
but... i had a five...
how's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
yeah.
thank you.
i'm sorry.
she was a delta gamma! not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. but i used to take her class at the la sports club. she's amazing!
you could have said no.
if king and country call, mac, you go as soon as i will.
elaine, i'm going back there.  just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
why not?
no, it requires such absolute precision --
i don't know. maybe in literature. that's his section.
it took some high-powered acting, believe me.
be quiet!  i order you to shut up.
no. but i am interested in the occult. and this is a kryta.
why do people go to war?
he's talking about bernard pearlstine.
so who killed him?
don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
how do they do that?
go on then! pa's in the barn saddlin' the fort worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
case...
chief inspector lee will brief your people...
i am on the staff of...
it's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  bud, you're still going to be president. and when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. with the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
paradise city, can you boost your power? we're barely receiving transmission.
shhhh.
you are panda, monarch of modems.
it couldn't!
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
what's he care about?
you want me to uninvite her?
i'm sorry. detective morelos.
so then you moved?
all i ever do is play. i should be doing something to get my own shop open.
yes...  we can transfer over to the inner ear, and go by way of the endolymphatic duct.
that gun at lahor, kipling's cannon - zamzammah - remember?  that was made out of the metal of ordinary things. i want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. his bayonet is thrust into the forge.  it's red hot.
there is. i own a place called kirby paint and title plus. we're out in the westgate shopping center in enid, oklahoma. the "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. stuff like that.
it's a form of botulism. i just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
fuck you.  i got a call today from sally doneghy ...
-- i can't accept it.  i don't want a car, dad.
your father?
you remember in school we talked about working together. that's what i was about to explain...
your kidding me. what is it a big party or something?
don't worry about it.  but when it happens and i'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
'take me'...?  where?
father, i am doing what i think is the best for him.  and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself.
i was looking for a needle and thread. i wasn't snooping. i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
i know where to look.
can you create life?
not a dent.  perfect
relax, i got him.
i didn't tell mama anything.  i was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  just now.
yeah?
<u>that's not the issue</u>!!  ugh!  how can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
what did you say?
now he's got no ears! you happy, nicky? your father's got no ears!
no, no. look. ok. let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
if you don't like me, just say so. you don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
i know.
goodbye.
commissioner, aquarius.
oh god brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
i do remember something good. all the time. i remember you.
yeah!
you messed with the evidence.
what of it?
doctor david ravell.
how?
certainly.
i had an accident - i fell down stairs...
i'm an old friend... i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in --
and what happens if we say no?
now? i don't know. i know that i'll never have the strength to leave you again.
was there ever any kind of investigation...
burgers all around.  medium.  rare.  raw.
yes? galvin, right?
there are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
nobody meant any harm. the boy was curious. i unloaded the gun -
let's move your ass in there!!
yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
mr. barrenger.
picture, mr. saavik.
no -- you don't want to be alone at all -- you were in despair before -- if i left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, you must not be alone -- you mustn't cry -- you must forget... tell me that i can stay with you -- tell me.
yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
do you know of spirit assassins? you do know the dead can rise? properly motivated, of course.
i don't know.
what's wrong.
you're out of time, man.
you're always your harshest critic.
i am tom green, i am tom green. daddy want some sausage, sausage. daddy want some sausage...
the second note to wake the gods...
big mistake.
sure.
i think he's yours, now.
now, come on -- you know i'm not ready for that kind of --
she say she in great pain.
oh yes, certainly. certainly, herr director!
but there's a sad catch to the story.
what's up?
she's gone and the present is trivia, which i can scribble down as notes.
there's no joy in it for me.
i won't disturb anything, mr. yow, i promise. be gone before you know it.
sure, on me.  i got diner's club.
mr. jung, do you know diego delgado?
florida license plate.
i hear you.
i am fine...  i gotta go.  goodbye.
shaw's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth?
why do you want to know my name?
but, wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
opera?
wait a second --
let's get out of here.
no. don't tell the guards.
honey?
you're fucking me.
no.
i beg your pardon?
agnes... agnes...
tell him i said "hi".
no thanks, i--
who ?
look, i didn't shoot him!
y'what?
good day!
i don't know about water buffaloes, but i know about him. he's kind and sweet and considerate. he wants a home -- and children.
what's left of it.
you're the best, maxie.
thanks, joe.
gwen. the show. there's no choice. do it.
uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
i told you. he gave them to me.
more history, rose.
you need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
i don't care if it is marilyn monroe -- i'm already in bed -- and i've taken a sleeping pill -- so i'm afraid the answer is no.
like weird calls, by any chance?
so's mine.
pitt.
i've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  but i'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
the letter? the letter ain't worth nuthin'.
i told them you got a half a million dollars in mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
tonight, when we close.
that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch catherine.
that's it.
if we don't try, zordon won't survive!
andy, you're not horrible.  you're just... complicated.
no thanks.
it's really on there tight.
i would like to pick you up now. may i do that?
sure.
know where we're a-goin'?
did you not hear me? we can't give out no information.
yes, janet.  life's pretty cheap to that type.
and how's the diva doing?
ooh, well excuse me.
shhh.
that needle ain't pointing north!
everything... you... say! and i can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! because you keep from me... what they can discover. and they will discover everything! believe me.
i know she's not with them. i know something else. what's bothering you isn't her.
what is it, rakonin? did you lose your job?
back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> no offense, stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. i didn't want to send you back without him.
okay, okay--i know you do, too.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
yeah.  i'll see ya... dad.
a hanger.
what? that's just gordon's bad taste.
no! mercutio!
naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. there might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. you go on.
you're right, mr. president i don't like feeling sorry for myself.
yeah. i've been keeping journals since i was seven.
i believe you'll find everything shipshape, admiral.
aunt barbara. i love you, but you're not gonna get it.
well, remember, its leathery magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
if i were guilty, and if i wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  it wouldn't be tiring at all.
we gonna crash?
god, you smell like whiskey.
i got a delivery around here. name of tucker.
orders.
i'll take sixth.  it's faster.
how come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the church haven't come up with shit? you got some kinda inside track?
christy.  christy van cartier.
molecular-memory.
you think that <u>is</u> the truth.
what do you mean?
ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
will we ever be in war?
indeed i am.  and the connection, between dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, i could show you...
if you like.
well what then?
mmmm, you're right. those clothes don't do you justice. why don't you take them off.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
first of all, mr. fox, you can't just come barging in here. and what makes you think it's his birthday?
yup.  hey, so i heard you dropped in on tran last night.  another slick lenny move.
not if you don't grow up...
i'll tell you why. i don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  personally, you can have all the credit you want. but for that deal - not a cent.
no, no trouble.  there's other work to do.
it's so... small.
does osborne agree?
why?... why should you carry other people's bags?
oh...i came close once.
hey, i got it! take some mental notes. you just might learn something here.
a police report.
get going! 
that's my opinion.
i'm thinking dorsia.
you say that like i don't know that.
maybe i just want to hear you say it.
wait a minute.
he's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
you know why? he tries to hold her. she resists
the chief?  or maybe even turrentine?  your c.o.?
well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit with cupid's arrow; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
the name's walter.
you want me to follow them to littleton?
well, thank you. why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
i was hired, you told me, to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century.  this merger is the vehicle --
and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he's got a little something i think you'll like.
are you trying, damn it?  just --
perfect, george.  perfect.  everything is fine down here.  everything is all set up.
louder.  they can't hear you.
who were you with?
i assure you, mr. boone, i meant no --
to everyone, i'm afraid. the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
you may proceede.
very beautiful country up here...
what are you doing here?
of course you're invited. you're a big donor to the campaign. they love you.
that's a good question.  what is it about fences?  sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  why would that be?
oh.  'bye, doc.
i'm so excited i just can't hide it.  i'm about to lode control and i think i like it.
much better--thank you--
what do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
oh, no!  nothing like that.  mother always thought - she used to talk about grand opera for me.  imagine! an american girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that mother - you know what mothers are like.
interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
driving mr. lenny.
you know nothing.  what you don't know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most.  you're never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh.  but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what's between you and that jew woman?
showing vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  this one, for instance.
i didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, i know --
quite.  come, let's mingle.
sorry.
i'll go in right now and get that eye.
you sure?
yeah, i know.
we've got powder but no ball!
how do you do, belle? how are you, jabez?  well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
lady van tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  she bears so little resemblance.
you're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk.
well...
but you don't know where he is.
no, not at all. brad you're pretty enough to be one.
i'm not going near any lifeboat!
if i don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
home after.  will you come in and say "hi"?
and i don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  you!  drew!  i don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
the national safety council would be appalled.
maybe you could run it without stella.
yes?
better.
sorry, kitty! i'll be right back after i choke my monkey.
i'm not interested --
and the kid says, "yeah. she's about 19, good-lookin." mccall says, "what can i tell you?"
what?
don't you know?
ruby mcnutt. my one true love.
castor troy almost strangled me to death.  where the hell were you?
i wouldn't think of leaving, hans. unless you want to open the front door...?
no. i'd want a public phone.
how about these?
come on, spicoli. why don't you just put your shirts back on? see the sign?
here.  i wish i coulda met my real dad.
why this is outrageous!...
okay, gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... lee, go huddle with the d.o.d. i want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
how do you know what they're doing?
this better not be some freddy joke.
it says jade fox is hiding at yu's. on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yu's.  were you involved?
very good, sir.
hello, my friend.  he doesn't look french to me, vincent.
the future, marty, the future is everything! i built this machine to see the future. so i am going to send shemp twenty-four hours into the future. you can assist me, if you like.
not to speak of. peter and i were both loners. there was nobody.
his mixture got screwed up.  he panicked and pranged his regulator.
mother!
that's right.
explain it to them.  i'm bugging out of here.
mary clarence!
i know what you're thinking.  you'd be a lot safer if i weren't around.
i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
thank you. very nice.
with a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
you want out of this place, don't you? don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
this mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
...have to wait.
more than likely.
not to mention court reynolds. unfortunately, ronald's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder.
yeah...see you at three.
what's the...oh shit!
will they give him a trial?
i did five years in attica. lot of cons helped me in the joint. but i never got help from any lawyer... i built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "art's supplies" is for ex- cons. not lawyers.
it's not safe.
who else?  i'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome!  or for the glory of you!
what do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
sure.
shoot.
my lawyer?  why do i need a lawyer?
but that's impossible!! george asked her out! he had to! i saw him walk her home! oh, god!
i won't be here.
why?
no. poetic justice, though.
okay. what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne. what if bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
hurry back. hurry back to what?
i'm sure he is. but gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
water or mineral deposits.
what?
oh, out a ways.  maybe the lighthouse.
right. just a sec.
do i?
ethan?
i'm just an investigator, bill.  i leave the theories to you lawyers.
not at all, countess ... there's one very good stone in it.
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, major?
that's because i've been on the wagon.
i'll see you tomorrow.
i'll get us out of here.
and i'm sorry for you, too, sidney. you're going down with the ship.
a gag. a gag!
maybe he wants something.
don't move!
for the moment, mr. grady.  only for the moment.
you're with me even when you're away.
in their eyes, the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
logic.  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270--  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
no, it wasn't, was it? you didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
cathy!
oh miles!
are you pulling my leg?
no.
i'm sorry, mom.
i am relaxing.
--you'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
elves!  they're always tormenting babies.  they make them cry and take their tears.
when's he coming back...?
i've tried calling and writing.  i want to reach michael.
hold her, boys!
what if i was vince?  you'd be dead right now.  what are you doing giving interviews on tv?
excuse me, have you got tooth...
just what i said i'd do.
sgt. mcmanus, are you suggesting that david and jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. we have two witnesses to the crime. you'll forgive me, mr. kessler, if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
no.
... . well  you have to figure out what it wants... what's its motivation?
who?
oh--jim!
come warm yourself if you like.
full sentences.  as if she had been speaking all along.
i understand perfectly, mr. pinkus, and as long as i am mayor --
oh my god, sir!
jason?! where is he?!
close your eyes, feel your fingertips. tell me everything you feel.
it's just ail that crap he spins out. just once i'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
where's jill?
what about you, radio?
that's necessary, huh?
she --
did you see it?
get the fuck outta here!
it won't be him.
i have no idea.
i got it. but listen, kate didn't know what's on it. i mean, she came to me to figure it out. she's not the one who planted the virus. you leave her alone.
i'm a comedian.
she did.
we can keep it in the bathroom.
he always just picked it up at my place. but with a.t.f. involved, i want to stage it. you know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. then it's up to ray nicolet, the a.t.f. guy to follow the shopping bag.
are your parking permits in the computer? he drives a van.
wait a sec, marty.  call us back.  two minutes.
you don't owe me no nothing.
violation?
yes, air.  but i'm usually wrong. sir.
chipped?  the door?  how can it be chipped?
how long have you worked at the casino?
good, good. drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. so what's happening? still no word?
is it your vehicle?
i got a record. i was zero cool.
i didn't know... i --
i'm going to stick it out here.  we still have a shot.
i've got to work...
yeah.
what about me - jim called an abort - i didn't comply.  i lost the team. i just need you to be safe.
i wouldn't know where to start.  i guess it was about one man framing another. he thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
martin, we hired the best man we could find.
it must be up in your old room.  i will look.
you can't send him back to oklahoma. it'd be inhumane.
no, no james, it's not like that.  tony and china, they're just friends.
katherine.
now, i don't know amy --
if corbett's men find out --
everything go alright?
it is a fucking game.  you said so yourself, dude--she kidnapped herself--
she's punishing me for being honest. i should just go to her house.
"yes, jordan -- i'll wait for you no matter how long."
it wasn't him.
like this? look at me! like this?
-- offer me money --
good night.
gotcha, cab three.  who is that?  that you, lindsey?
that very nice.
bacon cheeseburgers.
listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
there isn't any such person.
shut up!
have you seen him?
and a snake-eye glare.
i'm sure.
i bet you did lots of bad things.
but they're not here yet.  tell me about <u>you</u>.
it's ten o'clock in the morning --
hey.  you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. let me worry about your date.
maybe she did, gus.  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
it's insured.
well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  i'd better get a cab.
great.
a window onto the human condition?
i'm telling you, animal, these nazis ain't kosher.
what rate?
mmmm.....
i saw him last night!
what!
i don't know, ma. i'm all knocked out. i think i'll just hang arounna house and watch...
buzz me the minute she comes in.
it's not safe for you to be either.
you know it. stay black...
i disappeared on you?
good. that's standard military packaging for plastique. get a look under it.
doing fine, sir.
that's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
he carried on some; kicked.
yeah, just started.
i'm looking for some pacific-tech professors...
honey!
folks'll ask question.
i know.
thank you, miss boatwright.
the bilge pumps. there --
we have to climb up that.
poor bastard.
come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  hello, ma, what's the matter?
demons... this wouldn't have been possible without you... you have given me incentive ellen - i can see clearer now...
i'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. just eat it.
just check whatever you were wearing last night. now!
if you say so.
no, i'm not gonna letcha. you have a great voice.
aren't you afraid to leave? you don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
right, evan. i believe you just said "sick fuck."
sure, they're safer.  you always know what they're going to do. trouble is, it gets a little dull.
thanks for not laughing at me.
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates...
so you could sleep! i mean christ!
no jeffrey!!
how come this is the only locked door around this museum? what's back there?
to make an ass of yourself.
he pissed me off.
where do you usually find a light switch?
you have to be kidding.
cbs does not do that. and, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
i don't want anyone to die.
look!  scar?...  do you know where he went? and if he has a girl with him...a <u>white</u> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
don't worry, i'm leaving.
well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
yeah, but she had divine guidance.
not a cent, i swear to god, i swear on my mother's eyes.
any trouble, we whip out our treasury department badges -- show them the wire i'm wearing and read them their rights.  theo seizes the krugerands as evidence. naturally they start negotiating. offer to give us up somebody else. and we listen.  take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at justice.  we pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
you in a big hurry, boy?
eve?!
jacob.  we've got to get to amanda before it's too late.
look doctor, i don't know how to tell you this politely, but i don't approve of you. not you personally...
at the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
happy new year.
that's where i'm going.  to see her.
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
hi.
and you never cried -
miss johnson is a teacher, and...
good...it's going good.
ok.
gibarian.  he was here.
someone broke into this room.
who cares? as long as they're keeping donovan busy. dad, you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
i just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  my name's tom grunick.
make yourself at home. you done it already.
do you recall my instructions to you, starling? what were they?
maybe they will.
oh -- did i forget to mention that?
alright, i said i was sorry.  can we start over again? i think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
i didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
inside 4th brigade compound ? that's crazy !
you can change it if you want to.
oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
christmas presents.
"mistake"?  what's that supposed to...?
so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat. he wanted to play with me.
i am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
looks clear.
'amen i say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
really?
don't you see?  i had to make it right. i ignored my mother's crossing.  i sat with them all.  i held their hands.  i stroked their hair.  i was with them to the end.  i took away the blood.  i washed them.  their crossing was peaceful.
you say you saw some activity here?
i'm going in there.
i see, a flying carpet, huh? i don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
listen to me! you don't! the jacket is my only chance in this place.
i saw judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  i wanted to say something...  but i... i was so relieved that grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
so what did happen?
yes, i'm gonna ride on the shoot-the-chutes. an' you know in the dark mill? ever been in the dark mill?
god, i'm so sick of seymour.
i want you to say kaddish for her. it's the only thing she asked from us....
call.
merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
oooo... big fucking scary guy. just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
it was perfect.  the harder i pushed, the more you pulled away.
i just need some time...
that's why i'm calling, miss price...
what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
we don't speak czech!
why do you ask?
for what? a couple hundred bucks?
these were killers. conklin had them all jacked up. they were dobermans.
lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. i'll be back in a minute.
what a tragedy.  it was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
why are you doing this to me??  do you get pleasure from hurting me?
oh, i wasn't pointing my finger at you. hey, you have to think of yourself. a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. there are too many bad people out there.
all set for what?
"just!?"
republican?
and now?
excellent. see. who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? well, it's been grand. sorry you all have to die now.
he had to leave early to be with his daughter.  she's getting a divorce.

cinn?
you're doing fine. i won't let anything happen to you, remember?
tell him how you feel -- you miss him. tell him you're sorry.
i don't want to dupe her, jessica.  if i say it, i have to be sure i mean it.
this guy's on television.
i did. and then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
i can't sleep anymore. it's too much like death.
i'm working on it.
yeah.
huh?  you're implying i'm some kinda psycho criminal?
what does he know about it?
of course not.
who?
that's narrow?
keep going or i will!
nuwanda recited poetry to gloria and she jumped all over him... right, nuwanda?
i hope that's the cousin.
you've got to get yourself out of that place. they're going to kill you if you don't.
now look,  pay attention to me. what i'm gonna tell you is very important.
do you think i could buy some before you leave?
kurtzweil, we think.
should we scramble tachq for an intercept?
yeah, that's why i walked down here.
monsieur. quel numero.
are those stories true?
simulated one.
no, dave, i wasn't.
do you know how you caught me, will?
fuck.  basher-basher, this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction. stand by for a prc fix...
three...
this version doesn't have fighting?
don't ask.
oh, hi.  i'm an old high school buddy of dwayne's.  i was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. but i've gotta catch a plane so i'm afraid i'm not gonna be able to make it.
of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
yeah baby. i think someone did.
they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.
but they're expecting us. it wouldn't be polite.
a new disease.
not from me, surely...
ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, i am like a mother tonight. i want a child.
rath.  robert rath.
i don't know... but i'm sure he's not sleeping.
that's funny, i was just wondering what i was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
the boy worries me. it's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his dad.
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
yes.
you'd know better'n me.
sure...
chase. hi...
no word at all?
my dad plays for the "clippers."  he says i'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but i'ma play for them, too.  same number and everything.
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs. he had a device he called the intruder.
says she can get me in to see this killer.
let's face it.  you want me.
it's a mistake, honey. you two go on. i'll walk back to the depot.
you fucking bastard!
the gloves on the table are for you.
they'd better be...i don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
good.  we're very excited about him.  he was a rhodes scholar, you know.
feel this.
it's getting dark. go home.
johana... new york.

and you were gonna pay me back?
go ahead serafine. blow him away.
don't say that.
what about our quota?
not at all.  my name is merrick.  i was sent to find you some time ago. i should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. you should have been taught, prepared.
don't get caught, that's what! she'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
go on--give 'em to your friends.
ow...
ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
you have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
who is there?
that's great.
oh my god.
well... the manager, mr. heem, would like to meet him. nothing unusual. mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
this isn't right.
yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  what if they were trying to get out?
i was never much of a sweater. you know that.
this isn't an attempt to be gallant. if i don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
mike, i don't understand.  don't ask me to do that.
romeo, come forth.
billy had alibis too.
but you are aware, he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager.
yeah.
the matrix isn't real!

kobayashi.
you know so much.  they've got christy, and we've got to find her.  get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  fax it to every contact we got.
i ain't mad at you...
sorry, i'm so late. lester just wouldn't let me go. we’re supposed to have dinner with him on friday. i can get us out of it if you want. he's really amazing, this insane old lech. it's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
everybody's a doctor around here. this apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  the guy i'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. what kind of doctor?
oh, icey, i'm a sight!
no thanks.
he likes her.
are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
i want you to see our hospital.
so then, mr. mast...
one week -- i'll see to it, sir.
that's right, your life is shit, and i'm to blame.  it's that simple.
i'll get right on it.
what are you going to see?
in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.
parker-- you go here, right?  got your camera?
the job's okay.

lloyd?
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. push the issues.
tom said he'd take care of it.
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, general jack d. ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four b-90's of the 843rd bomb wing, under his command.
yes.
i... i don't know, air.  this guy. mr. "best of the best of the best... " i don't know.  it's just still find it a little...  humorous.  i'm sorry.  sir.
yes, that's good. until he meets

i've had it with you.  i'm leaving.
what the hell are you talking about?
let's get out of here!
where is rick?
i just came to get some stuff. i'll be out in five minutes.  he doesn't want me around.
nothing you can say will upset me.
well -- as i remember it, we had an argument.
i'll send you a postcard. got to go.
no, but when i first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
you name it -- they argued about it. mr. marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
helping travelers.
i saw his soul wesley. he was face to face with his god, and no one lies in that situation. but your geronimo act rattled me, and i abandoned my instincts.  never abandon you instincts.
no. i'm not badly injured. but my leg is very sore.
sh-h-h-h-h!!
what about the route to the core?
how can i thank you?  how can i repay you for this part?  it's a...what a, thank you for this part.  the first scene at the old mill...
yeah.  ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  we use the same equipment, more or less...
not the jaguar. the _other_ car.
jeanne... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne!
that's great.  i'll just tell my creditors i'm not a rapist.  no problem... shit.  i can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
thanks, cooch.
we didn't do nothin' special i can remember. just talked, is all.

what man?
thanks... you can keep the doll.
well, jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
i'll take them both.

i think he's already feeling better.
why must he be anybody?
i just got back -- i don't know which end is up.
“...but it’s getting there. “
yes.  conviction.  conviction that i'm onto the truth.  you're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  you're going to run again.  and i'm not leaving until you do.
bye.
i was fired by wyant wheeler. i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners.
you could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's easter sunday hats.
i'm not looking for a friend. i'm looking for a jedi master.
not at all.  i'll catch you later.
you'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
you want to go with me?

the mafia hire jack hewitt?
oh, goody. i'm so pleased. i'd clap if i could.
fine.
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
a car ... a car accident.
shortly after i arrived at danbury federal correctional institute i related to diego that the crime i was in for was smuggling marijuana. diego told me he had high level connections in colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into america...
nachurly. jus' like i'd tell you.
absolutely.
charming.
would you like some?
i sincerely hope not.
the one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
of course.  this afternoon.
that's what i've been trying to tell these people.
perfectly innocent! man have been hanged for less! i'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were holy gospel!
half past eleven.
what?
why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.
well... in a newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
she sits down.
for rabbits?
i think something's fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
jeffrey!
the baptist got his name from drowning people for hatchet.
that counts.
it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command, admiral... also, i must apologize for my attire.  i seem to have misplaced my uniform.

you're not going to tell me that.
here.  i played gregory lutz.
she was jonesing for me.

no. not yet he isn't.
my lord, i'm not sure that...
michael, i...
don't try to make me feel guilty. the whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. i can't do it. i can't be more than your friend. because i know what will happen. in a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
i don't care! we'd be together.
can you believe the songs they been playin'?
don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. first rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. where do we stand?
i heard it too.
why?!  who the hell knows?!
i was a treasury agent for eight years.  why?
what's that?
people make you laugh?
look sid, a buzz burger. the faz's favorite lunch. sid reaches for the plate. buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from sid.
sergeant?
yo!
no i'm not.
where is she?
full impulse.
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions.  see, we're not even sure which agency harry works for.  now, samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
no. we came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  can you fix it for us?
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
what are you talking about?
when this is over, i owe you a drink.
the clipper to america.
i thought you'd be psyched.  just trying to do what you did.  take nothing and make something out of it.
you can always he thinner. look...better.
exactly.  look at the digestive system. it's been drastically simplified.  super charged.  and this --
watching tv.
what! how do you know?
i didn't frisk him. he must have dropped it in burns' office. i didn't know whose it was.
come here.  you know, a few minutes ago i was in cluett's office and mrs. dickson was there.
i'm only asking what you think.
wasn't no bullet.
the basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
my, my...
calmer than you are.
it happens to be a matter of life and death.
there's been an accident, truman.
but i love gatherings. isn't it ironic?
what?
okay, get your clothes on. i got the cab downstairs.
but clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
that's following a train of thought.
is there something else that's bothering you, mr. president?
good deal, man.
all right, walter.
good night.  and i am very grateful to you.
i know, but...
he can take care of himself and i'm not afraid of you.  and you forgot one thing, lieutenant. pierce also taught me how to fuck... can i get you a drink?
i think not.  there'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  you'll get a charge out of this.
your mother won't be going right away, charles -
not much.
how come you didn't close your eyes?
get oack on their tail.
i'll leave this afternoon. happy?
why do you say that, brother? i had a shower this morning.
yeah.
but he's never said a word-
excuse me -- theresa, was it?  there are no holes in my research.
you must show me your secrets, blossom, before i show you mine.
things are quite serious, i should say.
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
so what's wrong with that?
he doesn't have a temperature.
whoa, hans, now you're the cowboy?
lydia, we're the first trickle! in a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to cross-reff them through?
don't i know you?
oh, i'll be back before christmas.
don't yell, honey.  please don't go crazy --
she's got <u>photos</u>, barbara.
yeah whaddya want?.
well, it looks like it, jasper.
is that why you and your friend split up?  because you wanted to be free?
one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... after he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
no breach-of-promise case has been filed. the matter has been settled out of court.
did he explain how this happened?
oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... i don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. but girls are like that, clever and cunning. you've got to laugh.
oh yes, major, i have recordings of all his symphonies. i kept them safe during the bombing. my favourite is the seventh symphony.
it's not ignorant.
water...water -- oh, you already said that.
resurrection.
i think you should go back to your seat now, joey. right, clarence?
he is, mr. torrance.
now we'll both call him.
yes, sir.  general, can i ask a question?
ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?
she knows stuff about me that only you know.
we're talking, aren't we?
phony, huh?
i ain't sleepy.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  seven.
well, uh, i'm raring to go.
you're wrong.  everything we do leaves its mark.  you said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
thank you. now, where were we?
how shall we find this cave, o tim?
i don't love ya no more.
i'm sleeping in my room.
got it.  you ever space walked?
i took a cab.
well, if you must know, they could be closer.
don't you know i'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
let 'em complain. i'm the one who's here.
i expect to try.
couple minutes. i saw the last shot. that was pretty cool.
help me.
wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
give me a readout, dejesus.
get over here, damn it! short round, come on, grab onto me tight!
you will not screw this up.
i don't know.
don't you like her?
pretend, darling.  it's all soul's eve.  round about the fire we go...  over the flames we leapt
no, sir. plainly put, i never expect to sleep again.
as much as joe's?
i don't buy that hot dog shit.  so you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to haleiwa.
were all these people questioned this afternoon?
nell, the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
we talked about a lot of things.
don't worry, we'll get it...
i'm afraid my people haven't.  i'm very sorry -- i wish it were otherwise.
you're going to hold me up at a time like this?
no.  go ahead.
and we can't purge the chiefs. our invasion talk will look like a bluff. or even that there's been an attempted coup.
yes i am.
blue? let's offset his mood. find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
i said... you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday.
i want d.a. bureau men to tail dudley smith twenty-four hours a day; i want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; i want authorization to check his bank records and i want it all in an hour.
they interview you or anything? at the plane crash?
okay.  thanks, barney.  you're the best.
yes?
if chewing gum is chewed, the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden...
yeah.  i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
i did.
matching speed... now. range to target ten thousand meters and closing... skipper, i got a bad feeling about this...
sharks are man-biters, mister hutton.  not man-eaters --
yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. i'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
really?  and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you?
yes. say hello to col --
ah?!
take the test again.
unfortunately, no.
i keep telling myself that.
you'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
i can't do this, honey.
who is he?
i'm too tired for this now.  i know i'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up?  i need to be able to think while i do it and i can't think while you're here.
wouldn't dream of it.
well... here.
i want to fuck.
indeed -- well, you may tell dr. corvisart, i should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
it's -- it's a souvenir. of baltimore.
why not?
engine 115, right?
captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
yeah, but are you crazy enough?
my lawyer went over this beforehand.
well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. just told me to pick up captain kramer.
i like to watch.
hey!
hey, what's that?
you told him that?
why?
i've done nothing. this is who they are. didn't you know that?
thanks.
brean, shaking his head.  in the b.g., moss, drinking. the tv comes to life.
cahuenga pass. make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl. you should be able to pick up utopia's tracer there.  once you go inside, you're on your own.  you know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
it's my head, schwartz, and i'll see you in court!
so, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  no one else, including myself?
i was afraid you'd say that.
you called me so you could have a place to stay.
you'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
carry out this tragic folly if you will -- but i for one will not be a part of it.  i will stay here in freedonia.
what's it all about?  it's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
please. i want you to. it would make me so happy.
we think?
right.
at least he's got people around him.
after we've looked, we'll talk.
<i>fiji.</i>
you're part of this, aren't you?!
where are you going now?
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
i planned on catching him, captain.
can't help myself.  corbett's type always pisses me off.  oh, i found this at the post office.  had your name on it.
you're a little overqualified, aren't you?
how do you like it?
i’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
it makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
well what?
but what if he dies and has to go to the pet sematary?
a detective's nightmare.
yeah. sure. yeah. we're on it bigtime. lots of leads. you bet.
now, get out!!
he said to follow him.
i'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  i'm not staying.
there's no such thing as tough, creasy. just trained and untrained.
hear me out.  i've known you a long time.  i see a difference in you this week.  like that tie. i'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. especially when i see her talking with david kross.
oh -- good. and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger? and thinner?
i guess i probably used to when i was your age.
a horseshoer?
all right, mickey.
i guess if i had my choice, i'd like to do something that involves children.  work with kids in some way.  teenagers, maybe.  and santa carla seems to be full of them.
oh, i understand, all right. i've been understanding since i was seventeen. and the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
indeed it is. during the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. as it were.
jews. she's talking about jews.
i never met the woman. i'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
are they heavy?
at least insofar as we have our first casualty.  me.
you better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
i'm surprised you don't know. it was a very popular tune in its day. i wrote it. how about this?
you.
muskets and uniforms and bayonets.
yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
you're welcome. well -- i'll see you later, mrs. robinson.
where did you go last night? what did you do?
i'll be running it three days a week, and...
majesty, i did. believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. but finally, i simply could not recommend herr mozart.
'round town.
excuse me?
perhaps he expected to eat it.
you find something curious in that?
we'll need a search running.
mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
can i steal you for a minute?
go get paulie, i don't care how sick he is.  pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
fine.
then who are you?
she killed burke dennings. she pushed him out of the window.
that what she was... a norfolk deb?
let's just do it and get out of here.
nothing. no mountains. no castles. looked like a giant parking lot. it wasn't even called hell.
i wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
yes -- yes, they have. it was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here.
-- christ, viktor, look around. what do you think pays for all this?  this is about investment and return.  those days in new york... that's... it's over.
tell me some true stories about dad.
anglo husbands can also be backward.
me.
yeah, but what about--
i think that about does it, spooky.
dickson doesn't have to go. but he must agree to this merger with new york trust—
yes, but i...
oh my god! why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
what are you going to do?
he couldn't get through the door, then?
i never said help us!
too many.
no thank you.
no.
well, they didn't think too much of 'em in paree.
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
i can't wait to see the pictures.
but don't you have to work?
he's alive.
i don't know. come on.
we're working on it.
starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
do you think i would let them harm you?
you never did answer my question.
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other.  think about it.
thank you... have you any news?
alex.
don't be insecure, doc. you're a big help.
and it's over...?
you don't make anything. it's for exercising.
no. i want to have a baby. i have to have a baby.
it hasn't yet.
tank, it's me.
how would the "enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with benton, pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
don't you?
i'm glad we didn't.
you're welcome. rose.
i know.
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
me?  oh, hell yes.  three.  i love 'em.  i love kids.  anything at all can and does happen.
i didn't hurt you.
well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
you're sure we have to?
look, mrs de moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother’s not back to his old weekend tricks! impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he’d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... have a look at it, mrs de moraes. i told you i had bad news...
and the title of this piece?
you know what... i remembered you were here and i woke up.
i'm trying hard to follow you.
don't worry about me, mr. general director pryesing -- worry about yourself.  there has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
she's my gynecologist.
the food is marvelous in cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop i could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in cuba regards wheeler.
i don't understand.
what?
meet us on the bridge.  be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
he said something else. "it's all right now. he's gone. the evil's gone."
hello marge!
thanks, stan. thanks.
i did.
you want me to be?
there's no time.
you want me to leave? why? because somebody is telling it like it is? somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
who? cluett? no, not yet. but i'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
it sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
how do you stop the screamer?
no, i don't really mean it. well, i mean, this is our last chance to think about it. how 'bout you, bama?
you and everybody else. god i hate this area. makes me nervous.
there's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the east landing platform.
dance? tonight?
you know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
coz of something i lost.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
lisa. gordon? oh, mr. gekko. sure. would you, uh, like to come in?
the fbi thinks it's possible--the democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  get off the story, ben--or put some people on mcgovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
no, admiral. i don't think you are; not one damned bit. i remember when you recommended me for this command. you told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
i have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
but we saw earth destroyed.
"mad about the boy."
maybe not.  but you know more than i do. you know something about this box. something about a statue?
to tell you?
yes?
you're a government spook?
not my mouth.  our mouth.
this is reilly deifenbach at gmac. sir, i have not yet received those vehicle ids you promised me.
no suspects, no motive.  unsolved.
and you got some italians -- ?
no, no, i don't want to keep you.
still drawing a blank.
no.  this is my lawyer, samuel sutherland.  i thought you two should meet.
i know i am. why, i even heard a shot up there last night.
no, no, no, captain. you do not understand. sybok also in a son of sarek.
you don't have any money left, okay?! that's the truth. i don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. you spent it all. you can't buy the tribune in chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. now you better face up to it--
i wasn't going to say --
how do i know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
erin?  what are you --
i came back. i thought that's what you wanted.
you think daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? i ain't going *nowhere*.
oh god, that's great!
maybe next time.
i'd like to get out but i don't have enough money.
would that make you any happier?
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
j.j., steve isn't...
yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  just be being with me.
i don't know.
good.  i want you to have a good time.
"the sting."
but --
there's somebody lookin' for me. not police. just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
uh, no, we're going to dinner... is this the way to the pasture?
yes, it was.
i don't see why. i'm twice as old as you are. how could anyone think --
simple.  be friendly like us.  not hostile.
schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
hey, augustus, i need your help, i got a serious problem here. i'm not screwing around.
who was that guy anyway ?
that's a comfort...
why me? what do you want from me!?
because i thought it proper, major.  why else would you think i'd do it?
you don't really want to know.
what are you thinking?
what?
you're unemployed, alfie.  boss is dead.  her plan is over.
like he meant it.
what happened?
what's this?
-careful, abdullah-
i've had my moments.
you feel bad about this?  about me?
dunn.
she says it's for the times when he's good to her. she's lonely since daddy died. she said sometimes she don't know why.  he threatened to kill her if she ever left him. my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. vaughan, he's real good to mama. vaughan that you met. but he's not able to do anything to doyle, he's funny you know. not funny ha, ha, funny queer. he likes to go with men instead of women. that makes him not to be able to fight too good. he sure is nice though. he's from st. louis. people who are queer can get along better in a big town. he got transferred here to work. but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. for bein' the way he is. i wish he liked to go with women. i'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than doyle.
jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. we're totally committed. it's time to brainstorm.
it's me or wallace, jack.  wallace's third party is only going to help mcgovern.  i need your support.
okay.
i don't know, dad doesn't either.
why not?
no, he picked me up.
a receiver tuned permanently to the senator's phone.
no, but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
don't you want to hear?
she thought it was me.
if we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
just felt a little chill.
something like that -
no.
no, look.  i do mind.  the dude minds. this will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  i mean, if your wife owes--
georgia.
are you kidding? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. i'm like a legend. they call me the cautionary whale.
so, who... uh, who packed my chute?
yes, i am.
look at jerry graff.  he's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  you see?  that's thinking.  why take ten percent?  a ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  what are we giving ninety per...for nothing. for some jerk sit in the office tell you "get out there and close." "go win the cadillac." graff.  he goes out and buys.  he pays top dollar for the... you see?
shhh!  ...but how can there be a question?... are you my lawyer or theirs?... all right, i'll let you know!
what are you talking about? look at all the honeys.
george? was he alone?
what do we do?
good, this way we can finally talk. i'll convince him this time.
that's what he said.
sir.
all france is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
maybe you wanted to.
you are bound by an oath, father.
do you think she killed johnny boz?
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  but he knew right and wrong.  oh, and we kind of messed around...
no, i was happy, but i just didn't realize i was happy.
oh, are you? does she know that?
good boy, port hole.
i don't know why i come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
how 'bout manson?
valiant?  what're you doin' here?
england can make no move against you on the continent without austria.  a reliable treaty with austria would end her hopes in that regard.
in what man!
you stand to win everything. call it.
nicole...
where are you going?
well, he should clean up this city here. it's full of filth and scum. scum and filth. it's like an open sewer. i can hardly take it. some days i go out and smell it then i get headaches that just stay and never go away. we need a president that would clean up this whole mess. flush it out.
she's right.
what about peter?...
that's too bad. get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. some kid i wouldn't let wash my mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. damn, i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger. he's fat, that's why, falls faster. i'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. am i shot, frank?
thanks. i'm cindy.
hm?  oh, yes.
do you remember what triggered it all?
are you planning to be the exception?
of course i'm crazy.  ask my mom.
we're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
of massey myerson?
that's so sweet, michael. but, really, i've so many things to do.
yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  now they want to do the same with theirs.
please, we hardly know each other.
kitchen and lower house.
i don't want any trouble.
she ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
have a drink?
think so?
it's gone.  no one will ever find out what's on it.
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  i wrote colonel doolittle, and told him i needed to see you before you go.
you get not to go to jail.
you must move away from the center.
well --
you're too young.
why because it's not my fate?  it's not in the book-of-all- knowledgefullness that i'm gonna be cheerleading at the barber game?
suppose they did. how does it concern you?
you worry about your end.  i got my side covered.
god? ...let me tell you something about god... he is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
didn't you now?  well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
if i'm going to die for the cia, i'm going to go out smoking.  besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
to you? in front of him?  with the...
hurry up! i'm freezing!
they don't.  now, son.  if you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  here's a little piece of advice:    don't use this so much.
he killed his father and then my family...
i want amphetamines.
they'll wait.  meantime, raise the lid.
wait a minute. what are you talking about?
what could there be except just another hill? in any event, i'm not curious. at the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. i'd give anything to be in london right now.
i don't know. gretchen has a theory. that frank is a sign. i told her i thought it was ridiculous.
no, it's not. i thought i was done waiting for reed... we're all in this together now, ben.
what happened? oh my god...
i need electrical field experience on my resume. everything helps...  why are you here?
i know that. bu tin this case he was right. arnold 'buster' luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  a pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. a pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, i created an empire.
passport, visas - you know the drill. we'll work the exfiltration thru canada, debrief you at langley.  throw the prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  follow me?
that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
yeah, but you know, i learned something today.  i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... to love each other.
betty.
thank you, henry.
your guilt is because you feel the same.
oh. sorry, andrew. valerie?
i don't know, i'm afraid.
well, it's very... homely.
i want to go home.
who wants your money-- maybe i can help you.
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
four-fifty.  that's the address...
yes, it does.
how do you know that?  did he say something?
mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. it's finished.  you've won.
i want serato ..  why can't i have serato?
zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
eh? well then, maybe he can go to zook's barn-raising, eh? see how good a carpenter.
how do you do, mr. falco.  if you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  help yourself to a glass of this n.y. state champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
he stayed a long time.
i do not know, holiness.
you didn't have to tell me.
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna.
i just saw a man walk out of your room.
well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. do you have any reason to believe it did?
i'm somewhere, thinking of you.  and meatballs.  and you know what?
right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...

i sense injuries.  the data could be called pain.
margo, as you know, i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith. i have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. you were one. jeanne eagels another... paula wessely... hayes - there are others, three or four. eve harrington will be among them...
he's made a few changes.
i mean, i was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  he was always on time.
to shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
no way...  ...i wanna rock!
with the forty thousand dollars?
why?
from what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  the combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
i really think you're overreacting in this whole -
then, tis not for chastity? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
he ain't dead? you didn't get him?
if mom's a psycho, scotty will still be ok, won't he?
you know he's a little dog. next time, if bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
get back here, both of you.  fall back to operations.
what do you listen to, stephen?
i'll remember.
i told her to get outta there.
that's fair enough.
if you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
they respond to fear, right?
come on.
mind your own business.
why not?
mm hmm.
you have no right to call yourself a bowler. buzz slaps theo in the face.
vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
the war ain't over til i <u>say</u> it's over.  this is <u>my</u> picture.  you think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  you think this is a tight spot?  try making the hunchback of notre dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of principal photography.  this is... this is... this is just...  act one:  the war. act <u>two</u> ... the... uh...
this is still hong kong.
i came to visit you.
where's sartorius?
i'll call her.
where?
edward bloom.
special occasion?
i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
if you don't  keep your neck in and your nose clean and you'll never have no trouble down here.
dr. lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
rudyard kipling?  no shit?  listen, we just need a minute of your time...
something to sharpen us up, you especially. we have the start.
one more time!
it's the future, isn't it? just like you told scrimm.  i knew you weren't from around here.
fuck off.
i'm sorry.
eddie, you screwed up.
what does a man usually tell a girl?
yes, i love you. i've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
no, sweetie. cynicism is bullshit.
you don't know the chicken places around where you live?  ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
ordell pick up his bond?
if they harass you, i, too, will resign.  and i will tell the world why.
it's your call, will. what do we do?
let me have some apple pie, helen.  who said anything about war? all i said was that some gulls...
more bang for the buck.
they?
sir, congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  you're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
and that's all he had to do.  just show his face.
no, mostly his wife's. she's in paris, france, right now. my husband delbert is real friendly with him. delbert's in law. does work for him.
she can.
yeah, or d, it's a dumb fucking idea...
there seems to be no secret about that.
what kind of nuts?
can i tell diane that peggy sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  well?
what hospital is he in? where?
it all happened so fast. such an unfortunate accident.
he's doing the best he can, charles.
but why shouldn't i?
quiet - i'm thinking.
oh, right. as long as you're happy. i'm sure he's a better lover than i ever was.
i know that. but --
enticements a power, wealth, settera.
they're bavarian death style  pretzels.
yes, vada i think you're very pretty. you've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
what did i do to deserve this?
that poet, norther winslow did. he was going to paris, france. he must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  tell you what. you take the other way and i'll cut through here. meet you on the far side.
you know, and the miserable is everyone else. that's-that's all. so- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- you're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
the important thing is we both made it. that's something we have in common.
this isn't the bedroom.
same old story.
you just want to ask me questions?
shut up, you dummy.  who did this to you?
ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
you have taken business class?
hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
who?
you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
who are you?
yeah, honey, let the kid watch t.v. hell, let's all watch t.v. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
well -- i could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
angelo, we gotta talk.
what're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
...damn you!  damn you!
i don't want to see that.
i wouldn't bet on that.
i think you know, frank.
she's just a damn road hugger, allison.  plus the man can drive.
i'm sorry... i guessed wrong.  i though you were a han.
no, del.
what the hell are you doing here, lothar?
good. you've both been working close to the front.
she went to california, to los angeles... she wanted to start over. she wanted to be an actress...
what?!
yes.  it's asta's christmas present.
you've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like joe...
mr. jameson--
then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
sure.
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
virginia?!
lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
we do it. he'll get clear once and for all
no.
what are you talking about?
no?
i didn't knock julia off.
bud, according to monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
the president's in europe. tomorrow he'll be in turkey. right along this fault line.  they launched the space shuttle yesterday.
the only thing you can do.  you must end it.
agnes...
the funny man. well, i got a new job for you, just for now. roc, i'm having a real shitty day. i'm depressed. tell me a funny story or a joke.
oh yeah. you were the built older guy with the black trans and the big...
i'm sorry...i just mentioned it in passing.  i never thought he'd use it.
oh, come now! you threw a time bomb.
see-cil.
you read about it, i'm sure.
you watch the draft this year? 'course you didn't, idiot question. they try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, i wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
aw, pretty good. kids are drivin' me crazy and phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. can't complain other than that. wouldn't do any good if i did.  do you know scooter, jerry?
do what? i haven't done a thing.
uh-huh. you're a scream, lovey.
hell, yes, yankee stadium. bombers are playing a double-header against the red sox.
father, i wasn't disputing you.
your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
who with?
can i just say--i totally love ex- lax.
miles, i gotta tell you something. victoria's coming to the wedding.
oh shit. i remember this.  want to go?
i plan to. i'll even help him if i can. he's going to lead me to the 'the dreamer'. someone i want very badly. but i'd like to understand him. give me that.
positive i.d.?
oh, thanks. i wish i could spend more time at it.
who are you? who sent you here?
it's your turn!
lemme see the map.
what could i do?  if she insisted, i had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  i threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
i didn't, baby, you just told me.
thank you very much for that.
listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- i'll do something drastic.
every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
i never met them.
it looks like it.  smell those fumes?
you're gonna get your fix...
you stink, sefton!
you wanna get unhaunted?
no.
come in out of the rain.  in the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
who is this?
from tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! is master shakespeare not handsome?
i'm afraid so.
adrenochrome...
well, there's not much to tell.
you wanna talk to me straight up?
you're a pig.
i'm here.
it's just a place for workmen.
you know what's ridiculous? your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff!
hawaii. i've read all about it. i've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. oh, god. i'd kill to go there.
yes, i know that sweetheart.
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country. he was afraid with no one home i'd— get into bad company.
brilliantly. care for a pint?
but...  give it us here, you dozy sod. you hide and get the guns ready. wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
what's wrong with it?
and what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, owen?  psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  and we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... i'm in trouble, owen.  i'm losing my faith.
you're a fuckin' mess.
it can't be coming from vega, the system's too young.
i'm not your brother!
this morning.
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i'd forged.
i thought so.
you know who i am.
i'm in it as we speak. [beat] you're haunting yourself right now. [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. you didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, dr. becker. it turned out different, didn't it?
just cool down, son.  i ain't accusing you of anything.  serves toby right to get his ass whooped. if you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
i've always wanted to go to europe, sir, but...
bobby, bobby, bobby.  rhymes with ... 
coast guard, special detective detail. we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk.
what are you talking about?  you never wait all day.  you can barely wait until it’s light out.
when you...  what?  i'm busy.
tell me what happened.
oh no. i'm not tired at all.
but dad'll never go for it.
i'm glad you came.  i'm sorry about the precautions.
why did you do this?
you're right, son. you must care the links with your family, always.  it's the only important thing in the world.
easier than that, buddy. i'll get them to destroy each other. you kill an entire peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. london, cairo, beijing... pretty soon everyone's involved. these guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days. no rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
you never fall short for the work people.  i guess maybe you just love them more.
meet you in the lobby. okay?
whom?
i said, no thanks.
well, shake a leg.  get these files downstairs...  and, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
act casual!
amazing.
i'm used to being on the outside looking in.  the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
[who ordered it?]
for god's sakes, let me out!!
why did you hang up on me?
thank you.
i don't blame him. jean-louis -- do you know where this monsieur félix lives?
beats me.
i hate the platonic idea of you.
i think so.
how... how can you say that to me...?
what do i need for that?
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
therapy session is over.
do you, indeed.  i'll bet you do. fine.  fine.  we'll save the court the time.  we will admit the doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
i don't know.
i'll think about it.
sure.
a coke.
a.i.?  you mean artificial intelligence?
like what? be a rock star?
deuce perkins.  mickey c's narcotics lieutenant.  the night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of mickey's heroin went missing.
quieter? oh, yes, of course.
on a gallon a gas?  let's set up the tent. maybe i can fix us up some stew.
what? you sure?
where i come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
the point is, they are paying for information.  real information.  not tooth paste brands.  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. you are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
we have to be certain.  once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
why not?
he wouldn't.
what do they do?
ja-shwa tsway. these are lips.
i'm a working stiff, pops.
and you believed him when he told you he had done that.
maybe --
tell me somethin'.  is this my vacation or isn't it?  i mean, god, you're as bad as darryl.
he's gone.
yeah.
i see.  and where did you drive?
look -- i'm sorry -- i've led everybody wrong. i mean yes, i get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  i'm sure this will amuse you; i'm scared of the dark. and sometimes i get shook up, i hear people or -- well, i'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
thank you.
it's simple.  you need me.  i need you.  and we will both need money.
portchnik.
it's okay... it's okay...
sounds like a russian general.
oh yes. i remember everyone who was on the lakul, every face. even the ones who didn't make it.
joe sounds like a ringer, bill.  i have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  need any help with the details?
yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
and what would'st i gain from this bargain?
in my house, you watch that lip...
jim court... no, this is her father.  i'll take...
i think not.
go down in my room.
go ahead.
y'ever heard of a double agent, bill? i'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist... after the arrest, 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  now here's another one for you:  what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine?
leave me alone, norman.
how do you want it?
i'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. bad things! those are bad fucking things!
yes, captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
we're over in the house.
well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a dangerous felon. went in there with her gun, came out, <u>without</u> the felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
why should i ?
we just having our first date when you showed up.
i thought i saw your car. what are you doing in town?
you're fourteen years old here?
um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i didn't know how to handle it. so ...
honor thy mother and thy father too don't kill, don't steal, it's bad for you
well, you've been through it.  you know. you could make things easier for me.
this is embarrassing, you know. you introduced mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. it has to stop.
champion to champion.
no, it was local jurisdiction.
hm?
i don't go at all.
that's so.
it's not about being fun.  it's about being smart.  you take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. ever.  that's freedom.  that's what i'm talking about.
no wonder.  for starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  what are your plans while you're in town?
of course. she is my sister. i tell her almost everything.
great.
lenny?  you're an asshole.
the new man. i'd keep away from him, if i were you.
we cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
thanks.
now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which i never wanted to do. i told him that.
and that's exactly what he's going to do.
no.  it's a bit of a madhouse. for some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
sean, wait...
what's this?
the critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - i can't see that either of lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
i do fine, adam.  how 'bout yourself?  you doin' any good?
let me hang on with two hands or i will fall.
no, i really do. i think he's gonna kill me.
yeah, i know, he was up here. it's pitiful like you say. when he lost rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost rose.
there's a lot of night left to live through.
turn left ahead.
that cost me two weeks' pay.
short? it's ended.
who is that?
i just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting rodriego.
no, sandro, please... i ask you as a favor...
would you have free candy for the kids, preacher?
no. i'm just not tired. let's go.
it looks....foreign.
a book, huh?  i guess that means you can read... an' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... but then, like you told old andy there, you ain't armed, are you, bob?
oh no, mrs. robinson, oh no.
guests?
all my life i been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. and you gonna lay the blame at my feet? well, i ain't gonna take that.
it ain't nobody. it's a company.
gee, would you, mr. webster? honest?
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  god, michael --- what am i...?
really?
you pathetic piece of shit. i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
not at all.
oh yes, the very best.
the other girls are in the ground. exhumations are upsetting for the families. i'll do it if i have to, but -
it's a guy you know.
my friend jack was just here.
lloyd, when we were in principal collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
it's definitely your mama.
two or three days! while lyssa is in their hands?
it is not an effort. you are my son.  besides; i am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
you work at the hotel diplomat?
i wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so i won't care for you... i wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
sod off.
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
never.
i'm not experimenting.  why don't you go experiment.
you remember in school we talked about working together.  that's what i was about to explain...
what? what?
i can work here. maybe my work can help...help everyone. i can do more good with access to this equipment than i can off in some wasteland.
and you're not?
i admit nothing.
bullshit...
your majesty shall mock at me; i cannot speak your england.
i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. i'm convinced that, like david, they believe in this werewolf.
when it is time.
nah, don't bother --
you mean, besides elvis?  i'm a human being.  sure.  once. first time i ever ran away from home, i got as far as atlanta. i met this boy.  he'd been with his parents on their way to chicago.  they stopped at a gas station.  he went to the john. when he came back they'd split. we sorta started looking out for each other.  aw, he was sweet. and boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. the chicken hawks were on him all the time.  he hated that. sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  the two of us getting married someday. having kids.  stupid stuff.
hey -- comrade! over here! this is harry shapiro -- the volga boatman of barrack four!
then why go back now?
suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
anyway, you're crazy.
that's not true.  it's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... i'm indebted to you for everything... it's just...
isn't it?
huh.
how's everything at the apartment?
you know, you --
every time i'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
hey, don't worry about it. your daughter's around. we'll find her in a couple days.
he can't even move.
'morning, honey.
open this door!
he was our teacher... he was great.
bloody.
i wouldn't do that if i was you.
oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
wash her.
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that? do you dress up leslie?
you're uncommon friendly tonight, toddy. more like the old days.
that's not faith, it's physics.  the second law of thermodynamics.
genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
i will. come and kiss me.
i don't know -- i mean -- i wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
shit is a french word?
why would i lie to you?
if we were a team, we could do anything. i mean, anything.
yes, sir.
ah-h, if you happen to run into rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
sure, heaven! you've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
i don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. thatches ain't ole moses' way.
well, why not?
there is that, of course -- but mainly it is because i am so much smarter than everyone else.
is it gone four-thirty?
the magic word is "please."
sure, it's a meal ticket for me. i admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like mr. norton who's trying to crash national politics.  that's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? you wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  well, put john doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. he can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs. leeds and i'll tell you if you're right or not.
what kind?
how would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. that's almost a hundred dollars a week!
i'm sorry .maybe i better go dorothy.
you knew me as a kid.
if he doesn't shut up...
oh, this is mr. matuschka -- he's miss kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
who?
the cenobites. it's only a matter of time before they find i've slipped them. i have to get away from here.
my mouth is kinda dry.
i heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
it'll be all right.  we're old friends!
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
yeah, orson's a real piece of work. but deep down, he's a good kid. real deep down.
affirmative.
i don't know what to do, walter.
i'll be fine.
let me ask you, this mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin"?
he didn't say that.
i'm still on my honeymoon.
jean michel basquiat.
choices?
what about this point here?
but here's the rub. the guy i'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
calls himself dodd.
are you out of your mind?
how well did you know stacy and rod?
in the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
do you have something against science?
no, no. nothing like that. i just need his name. terry i can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
not a bad idea.  if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  now, i don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
in edmunds' things.
one meets so many attorneys in my business.  no, i don't believe i know dean andrews.
chairman mao can keep china. just give us back tibet.
yeah, i live here.
what?!
my wife?
i'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
will you shut up for a minute!!  pull your car out of line.
not from you.
plus some guys whose food i don't like.
splendid. now she can return the compliment.
you've... done... this... before.
all right.  let's get out of here.
no, please.
your lady friend.  the one who gave you her business card.  think she was just being polite?
i don't give a shit. that guy's got no right.
ted, i loved you and i'll always love you. but i need simon.  he's stable.  he's a good provider.  i want that at this stage of the game, ted.  he might have his faults, but simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man.
routine! i don't have a routine. and if you think that's what this is -
i am?
long day. go to sleep.
but i'm remembering the future.
looking up at the stars.
you're right, mr. bernstein.
yeah.  but you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
that's right, modern times.
oil can.....oil can....
tell me about your wife...
that's what we agreed.
who are you?
only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.
say, all wars have innocent victims.
that's not what i mean.  i'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  i am.
we could get back together too.
lemme alone...
it's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language.
cut! print it! what happens in the next reel? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
no.
i'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  it's like he slammed a door in cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in tobruk.
you think?
no way, old buddy.
we're in fashion.
you haven't changed at all! some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
i like my work.
wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
go back and tell dr. neilsen. have him report to the skipper.
yeah.
i will be with you, like this. forever.
goodnight.  where was she?
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
been on many planes that blew up, have you?
you want some bum in the bus terminal? we'll wait for a real call.
good night!
what's this?
no.  were you going to you?
show me your eyes.
all he could think about was getting to you. there's still love there i think.
let's get that tent down!
what happened to her?
a claymore to be exact.  you wouldn't know anything about it would you?
i thought you wouldn't want to spend christmas day alone in here.
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
you always overreact, clark. how terrible can it be?
you're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque?  take care of your body, yes!  but don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  don't become obsessed by your musculature.  any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. their magic was in their muscles. your magic is in your brains!
but they were not there.  <u>yesterday</u>.  is that called a delusion...?
i don't know.
transference.
fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. you know this little tid bit, dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. what the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, i don't know. goddam!!!  this is the suavest guy i know. look at you. you're one beautiful fucker, ben. i love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. i can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
i'd love to. if you're sure it's alright?
some little kid stole the hubcaps.
well, uh, alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as i do.
okay, but it has to be a small one.
but one day i'll catch you... like i caught her...
will you tell peter jennings to shut up and fucking listen. the shit's as routine as you get. i coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but maxie likes to do it all his way. safe. i coulda dropped the bag alone. it's only two hundred g's. but he sent you all. so i can either send you home and tell maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
that is so romantic.
no, forget it, it was stupid.
you want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
mm.
we're catching up!
that bothers you?
join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? thank you anyway.  and i like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
no thanks, mr. eddy.
how clumsy. i'd never forgive myself. good night my dear.
don't move!
sure, why not.  give him the trophy. that pretentious son of a bitch.  you heard him, norman.  all that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  and "impotent".  where does he get off saying i'm impotent?  he's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
no.
oh, god.  jesus.  this ain't happening.
high mag, mr. sulu!
you're not reman.
not yet.  what happened?
you mean profanity. that's simply the way they talk here. nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. you'll find it in all the literature of the period.
but seem to have gotten lost on the way.
well, in reality it's not that dangerous, bob. it's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.
looky here, i know you helped her and i know you know what i want. jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. she do that, we're still friends. now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' louis. and if she tries to turn me in, i'll name her ass as my accessory. we'll go upstate together. hand in handcuffed hand. now that shit's a promise, understand what i'm sayin'? you tell her that, and i'll call you back.
you know how old i am.
don't hold me so tight.
because i love them, but they drive me crazy.  you know how parents are?
we sometimes went downtown to score.
but you must!  i can't do it alone. i'm not at all like my father.  i'd never make it.
now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
i don't fuck my partners.
you don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, diz?
where's the fucking money?
oh, no, hey.  like i said. tammy wouldn't... she...
so now they're best friends? edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  it's too convenient.
-- last night we said a great many things. you said i was to do the thinking for both of us. well, i've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. you're getting on that plane with victor where you belong.
meet my father, herbert richard greenleaf 1st.
this is friday, her riding lesson is on tuesdays.  i got it right here...
twice...
hi.
dick, you don't have to make a statement.  herb covered it for you.
they're good!
no, ma'am...  mama, i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is, so me and sounder can go see him.
so mr. mcallister asked you to run.
in the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
you are a canadian spy working for the allies.  code-name moose.
good-day, miss winch. i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
we'd be in all the papers!
that's right.
thank you.
a miami d.a. the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis. 
i know.
no.
then let me give you something then...
oh my god, sir!
one-third? that's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
your job? you've got five thousand bucks. what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
yes.
you're welcome.
he's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
thass' right.  i got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
matter of fact...
gary.
yeah...
all directions are the same here.
yeah, well around here, i'm the most high... from now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
i know.
guess i'm not used to so much.
hold on, coop...
listen, edie, am i going to see you again?
what about christmas?
into the hudson?
she's the scream queen.
337.....i'm sorry....
casy, won't you say a few words?
yes, father.
yes.
i ain't killed nobody.  shall i rack 'em?  play a game, lupe?
no, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
you owe me.  besides, i'm cute.
i don't know.
when you been in prison three years, it don't take long. let's go.
i'm saying it now!
god, if chet found out he'd...
who's it, you mean.
i never cared about that.
little rum in yours, too?
...i want to say a thing.
when they want us done, they'll call in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit.
what grange?
can you recommend a restaurant?
take a right on 59th...  we'll put it someplace else.
bonds, sir?
mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
i don't know. i don't understand dickie, marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
i've never mentioned it to him.
i wouldn't bullshit you kid! snacky smores are now available in stores everywhere! no biggie!
where is he?
more than enough, actually.  i beg you, no more, please.
when did you join the force?  you know, the police force, the place you work...
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command.  they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
hunt is colson's man--  --that's charles colson, nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to brown university--  --hunt worked for the c.i.a. till '70, and this is on deep background, the fbi thinks he's involved with the break-in.
don't talk like that.  i'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
no - not all the time - i mean
i'm pregnant.
lower it!
be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
what <u>is</u> that?
i'll wait.
you'll beg for mercy in a second.
heather.
your stereo broke? god, i could hardly stand that. i live on music.
forget it.
what's the use? i can't win a pot.
and i'm its deliverer.  its calling card, if you will.  i follow it.  protect it. act as its guardian.  in a sense, sam, so do you.
and look here.  cease fire in chechenia.  that's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  listen to this, some gas company in colorado.  their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  they've accused the e.p.a. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
you know what i mean? like the tip o'your nose, and if i stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
i didn't want to do it, don jorge. they made me ...
hmm.
i don't think we have much of a choice...
i think it might also matter to mitch.
editorials?
why?
yeah.
tits -- see.
it's not that i didn't mean everything i wrote.  it's just that -- i thought you were dead.  and now --
i think i should have joined the air force!
nick, the ice is --
i don't care.
i don't know!
fund-raising??
if you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! i want nuts to butts!
no. wait... was she a great, fat person? i may have seen her, i'm not sure...
what's the chance of getting one of these?
where did you send the message to peter kurten?
fucking drunk, huh?
anyway, what i was wanting to say was this --
we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  no deposits, no withdrawals.  therefore no suspects.
she's a very groovy girl. that's the problem.
you can't take him out this late in the game.
you got no idea...
what for?
aren't you happy?  don't you feel proud...?  i feel proud and all i did was watch.
everything's fine, pop.
mrs. connelly. i'm martin bettes ...  dr. bettes.
i think he's really angry with me too.
it even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
me too!
nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
what is it you want from me?  some plantation follies?  some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  you want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
i'm such a loser.
how come i never hearda you before?
what?
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  look at it that way.  go on.
what is it?
you have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
susan --
okay, um, so it's lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  do you wanna go out?
they're all assholes.
of course not.  as a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  you see he needs help.
no -- please listen!  they're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
aw, toby, we weren't doing nothing. we was just talking.
i need your help.
lily.
you are well?
come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
well, how 'bout that?
ten bucks.
please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
you're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...we'll have to do it on our own.
jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  he was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. hits never bothered him. it was business. but what he really loved to do was steal.  i mean, he actually enjoyed it.  jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  he was one of the city's biggest hijackers. clothes. razor blades. booze. cigarettes. shrimp and lobsters. shrimp and lobsters were the best. they went fast.
yeah... i'll have a talk with him as soon as...
-- sacha, call a cab.
no.
oh, thank you! thank you! th-- <i></i> something went very, very wrong here.
i never was.
quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. go -- go at once, -- mr. preysing --
i love her but that doesn't mean i need to meet her.
i see she built a place up here by the river.
but -- but --
it's a death sentence.  i'll never make it to the trial.
no... do you?
steve...
no.
we'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
you can't threaten me --
it's their presidential suite.
but the time is now. soon others will come.
my dad used to play a game.  i never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
then leave her to me.
did you find her?
sure you do.  everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house.  it's a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  not for lack of trying.
what are you thinking? are you angry with me?
your predecessor. he did- n't like to get outta bed. catch you later, freddy t ..
i think sometimes, mrs. little, candor is the only kindness.
unfortunate, but i think we can work around it.
no way --
...a patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
doesn't matter.  we know where they're going.  c'mon.
marge and i are getting married.
i'll try. thanks.
did you like it, dear?
did you say anything to mrs. driscoll?
just a night out.  sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
yes.
you should see the other bitch. what time you got?
did you get him?
good.  i'll see you when you close, then. enjoy the lasagne.
sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
oh my god...
oh, c'mon... first the picture of tammy, then brett clemens, now this? it's scary.
well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  for you, chief, i make housecalls...
can't tell.  lots.  d gun's down to twenty.  ten.  it's out.
sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  i don't				* want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. you promise?
why are you doing this to me?
mmmmm. well, i'm off. maintain speed and heading, mr. lightoller.
the fortress of krull. when will it come near here?
what are they?
oh?
what are you talking about? there's no fat on this body.
what? are you all right?
could it be a glitch? something the construction workers caused?
i've read it; i'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  as a heavy investor, i'm pleased.  how did the doctor find you?
he's a pretty good actor, though.
i'll take you to school.
mm.
what if i was a relative?
i know.
sure.
is there any danger? some kind of virus?
sure i am.  she wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. if you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the president's wishes.  i can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
you used to love it when i called you doll.
that's where he's being clever. acting nonchalant.
yeah.
not really, frank. i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
i don't know, diego.  i've got a good thing going already.  everybody smokes pot.  it's easy.  cocaine is a rich man's drug.  it's too expensive.
what?
something must've happened! what set him off?
eh? how's that?
well that's just, that's the stress talking, dude.  so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
i'll say.
why?
he went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. ah, screw it; i'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
mike.  i can't believe i'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  but i think you need and deserve to know...
what! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? not so you could notice it! now, look, i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
china town. i need more serum.  what's all this?
ready, sir!
good morning, swana.
miss sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
no.
you've tried it?  isn't it true that you've been in and out of rehab centers for the last four years?
it's late.
gimlet.
gently.
i don't think this is a good time...
you'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
i feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  but hey, what'd i expect?
bill, i am eating dinner with you. and your family.  and that's what we're doing.  it's not open for discussion.  nothing is.  don't you understand?
exactly.
yes. i was washing my hair.
i yanked this off your rv. it's a global positioning tracker.
oh.
me?  you called it.  i got a message that...
only on a first name basis.
so it's to be torture.
visiting friends of hers in palm springs.  just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
congratulations. you just became a legend maker.
knott!
well, all right.
where is she? where is the girl?
but she's alright.
wanna dance?
what's your name?
"intra-agency fraternizing."
you'll have to speak up son. i have this ringing in my ears. my doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. i've had two operations on my heart.
what?
yes, yes.
wait a minute.  wait a minute.
i'm really lost.  what does this have to do with walking?
aye, captain  how many times do i have to tell you? the right tool for the right job...
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
he might have been wiped out by a plague. natural catastrophe. like a fiery storm of meteors. from the looks of this part of your planet, i'd say that was a fair bet.
somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
it's a date.  you buy the ice cream.
then why do i still have a badge?
huh?  will? is that you?
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
as for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
sorry, your honor, but when somebody sets me up like that i can't resist.
you have elected me security. the way things have been going in this barracks, i guess i've done a poor job and i want to make up for it. is that asking too much?
do you like the way i feel?
in what way do you mean?
that's why they call 'em terrorists.  go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  just watch 'em.
we could steal one of the choppers.
tell that to dr. freud! along with the rest of it...
boy! it sure has been a wonderful day. and you - you are beautiful.
who is "danny terrio?"
oh shit, yeah. can you lend some more money?
we are both full of shit.
i did not accept any.  i...  i wanted... to.  but i didn't. you know i didn't.  don't you?
-- in magazines nobody reads.
professor, you guys gotta see this. dwight, come here.
i understand.
i dunno.
epps, over.
bad decisions are easy to live with. forget.  just keep looking forward.
we run a pretty tight ship here.
i'm sick of you people. why don't you leave him be?
mr. brown stays in the car. he's parked across the street till i give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
for you! because i'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... proving everybody wrong. wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
lois, help! i can't --  i can't swim -- !
excuse me if i'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
yes, mum.
no.
of course. natural weather delivered to your door on demand. down your phoneline. for limited periods.
really? i never got a message.
he came for me, i had to run!
where?
guess i'm just lucky.
what?
i could take after dad, too.
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
and just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
harry!
thank you!
no, you're not in trouble.  i'm interested in a murder.
wait for my signal, spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
where's the body?
i care.  don't you know what caen's famous for, sarge?
i can see why you say that.  look, i'm sorry.  i really am.  the last thing i wanted was... that's why i left, because... i lost it, and i didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared.  i just wanted you to know, that's all.
you know what a mixer ball is? it's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
well, we should identify ourselves.
yeah, i suppose... dad, who's harry york?
...you bring a check?
but why?
i think we're going to find out.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
i guess i'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
has governor yu ever seen the sword?
yeah, you is. i know when people is in trouble, and you is.
warm and friendly and intelligent--  you know -- he's the only real friend i've made since i've been here.
well, you're a tower of support.
help me, sir?
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans, but i think they did it -- tex, gideon and scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. i'm trying to prove it. they think i'm working with them. but i'm not, and that's the truth. i'm on your side, reggie -- please believe that.
the car accident you were in... was there anyone else involved?
who's your little friend?
i'd like to, but i told dr. venkman i'd babysit.  do you want to babysit with me?
and i won't tell anyone who you are.
give up, babe. you can't fight it. believe me, my mom tried...
is there something more we should know about this suspect, sir?  i mean besides what's on his sheet.
christmas stories? sure, i know a ton of 'em.
... i bet you're gay.
uhh... bacon.
murder, sir.
where are we now?
not really. i know how competitive it all is --
shhhhhhhh!
morning!
captain, our shields -- !
nothing happened, he says. some operator you got yourself there, charley. one more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
what was the donner party?
we were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
it seemed that way to me.
yeah, but it was okay.
i meant about my idea.
you're firin' me?
just wait outside. tammy.
no you don't: but i'm gonna ask you one more time: are you alone in here?
you don't like it?
what do you mean, "you"?
okay, shorty.
outside with the sprinkler.  so it's good?
of course it's the place.
i'm going to tell the truth.
how about, nice to see you?  glad you're here to save my life.
oh?  how's he doing?
the american theater doesn't need people like that.
you're in check.
all right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
nothing's missing?
what boat?
it seems we <u>all</u> imagine god in our own image.
say, that's pretty good, young man.
what, johnny?  what is it?
just get back soon, or i start looking for a new groom.
what's the horse pill for, honey?
good morning.
and i was wondering.
do i?
what do you want?
i didn't do nothing wrong!  that was mayolia's!  i didn't ask her for it.  i don't know about any -
you don't hang out with the other guys.
wonderful psychology. why don't you say something about my mom?  excuse me.
-- yeah, honey...
why waste time -- it's getting late.
whadda you care?
lady viola is…young in the world. your majesty is wise in it. nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. i'll wager my fortune.
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? like this?
positive?
it doesn't matter where you sit!
he'll be impressed.  the clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
he won't kill her. -- goddammit!
i'm glad to hear that, paul, i really am. but you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "ooh, good, paul sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: an esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
yes. hi..congratulations. jack lucas. nice to meet you finally. this is anne napolitano, the owner of video spot.
for a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  that's all i know right now.
uhh... sure. and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
you think about your father a lot, don't you?
and your husband works for somebody else.
you're not gonna catch him. he can shape-shift into different animals. bear. elk. porcupine.
because you're my sister. there's nobody else.  the men who killed daddy are after jake. i gotta talk to him.
for whom and for what?
yes, sir. our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. the invasion happens eight days later.
...and i thought i'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
oh, absolutely, but trubshaw's a man worth meeting. no point setting out half shod.
it's *your* splice! you blame me for everything!
it's been customized for sleeping capacity.
sounds better than nothing.
i can't help it. i can't tell a soul.  i didn't even tell guild.
i don't care what it says! maybe mama was delirious, you know. she didn't know what she was saying. if she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
what's that?
i will.
i just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
the guy was history when he killed kelly.  you knew that.
you know what i mean
do you think you have free license to be insulting? believe me you have not. you think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
who thinks about such nonsense? now i'm alive.  when i'm dead, i'll be dead.
nice to see you, erin.  we've missed you.
what?
i wasn't born yesterday. now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy --
charlie luciano.
it's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
i'd rather read, thank-you.
you might want to find out. he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
what, again?
call the police!!
yeah.  pull in here.  park it.
you'll wait till you rot!
there's no secrets here, al.
why?
oh man... come on, i don't want no janitor job.
happy now?
beyond devil's needle, all is unknown.
i'm going it alone this time, vanessa. i have a follow-up visit with the evil doctor.
huh?  the problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
i wonder, would that work?  you know who i see for al roxy? harvey keitel. the man could do it in his sleep.
good luck on your mission, 007.
that's right. er... i can't listen to the 9th any more at all. when i hear the 9th, i get like this funny feeling.
jeff again.  has tom come in yet?
...her mother needs an operation...
you didn't tell your sister about ripley, did you?  'cause i don't wanna go through that again.
there's only one.
i'll bitch slap you into bangkok.
phasers on stun. move out.
you are...
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- i'll assume that's not your given name--
that's right.
are you tired?
mr. chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
i'm sorry about that. have you found anything out? you've got to tell me.
i'd like to bring you up to washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
i don't play games.
you're so good to protect her like this.
but claire--
with anything?
--but buddy deeds was my salvation.
nada.  lemme make the call.
no doctors?  that's fine. that's just fine.
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
well, that's a long way off, sweetie. we'll talk to mom and dad...
he'll turn around.
yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
yah-sure, fine... fine.
there's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
music, of course. to get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
maybe not, but why take chances?
--how do you know about that?
this can't be...
take it.
thank you.
take the number one chair, ibanez. follow all instructions of you supervisor.
if that was all, fine.  but carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
you can't hold it by yourself!
ever see one like this?
hey, pete... how ya doin'?
i lied.
i've got it -- hold on!
i'll say.
fine, joe.
i'm not asking you to.
what's the matter?
who's the other one?
the day i left you i just drove and drove. i drove all day and all that night, and i didn't go anywhere. i just kept driving. i stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and i sat --
you remember... saddam hussein, don't you?!
yeah.  well, me too.
what is it?  can i help?
twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
whoa, jim.  maybe.  but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
you just got hit.  the getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and i'm going after them crack of dawn... 
heck, yeah.  come on back.  just gonna need you to sign in here --
don't be such a pussy.
what?
okay.
you want me to give up, huh?  look, sal's in back with the girls. anything happens to me - one move - and sal gives it to them.  boom boom.  how do i know you won't jump me?
and anyway, what do i know about guerrilla warfare?
pardon my french, but bull shit.
you're the one who's hand is shaking.
well... thank you again.
what do you know about my father?
sorry if i crossed you up.
from what i've seen, mr. galvin, you have a very good case...
if you want caitlin, then face veronica, tell her, and be with caitlin. if you want veronica, be with veronica. but don't pine for one and fuck the other. man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. it was daddy's dream. he was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. it was what killed daddy. he didn't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
oh boy. destroy humanity and the federation is crippled.
the evil eye doesn't work on me.
dr. jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  why is that?
oh dear.  he wasn't friendly during the filming?
you said he was behind an extortion scheme.
i've read it twice, norman.  it's brilliant.
well, yeah, i just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
tim, fill out the alarm card.  clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
which?
miles? you're scaring me.
what about you?
but we went there.  we saw those kids.
king wasn't mexican, fenton--
you done?
i wasn't too old when i started the course. i was too old when it finished.
sire.
yeah!
when i opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
key? key? what is the key?
wait and see... wait and see...
engine room... scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
did you see her undressed?
i'll be your guest!
tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
you're english.
yes. louise will bring me lunch.
howls.
are you sure?
i have vacation time coming to me.
please.
then leave it in the past. old flames are like old tax returns.  you keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
so how is she?
i'd like you to leave now.
and i gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... i figured what's the harm. stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
i told you he's crazy.
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of.
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  i can't wait any longer.  i was wrong to let you go.  come back with me.  you'll be happy in the desert.  you'll be free there.
nothing.
oh, german! german! please let it be german.
he didn't come!
i don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think?
i know.
i'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
i ain't really thought about it too much i don't reckon.
sure. are you kidding? sure.
naw. i don't mind.
well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.
j.j., you said you want to help me - prove it!
whah you say? dissdee?
how everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  i used to be scared shitless i'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
c'mon, joanna, you don't mean that.  you're a terrific mother--
the name is oswald cobblepot.
in over your head?
why?  are you german?
it's about that john and that pearl?
but it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
no…no.
don't send me back!
oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy--
she's remaining in her room. she isn't feeling very well.  now please go on without me. i eat very little.
nobody's getting in here.  you can tell them all that!
all the girls drink - but i'm the one that gets caught.  that's the story of my life. i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
she's the boss.
i worked ten years without one, i don't need one now.
nowhere in particular.  don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
well, offer her a seat! you want me to do it?
it's been a while.  maybe i'm just out of practice.
fine.
goodbye, father.  i am sorry.
tell dad we're getting married in las vegas.  in one of those chapels.  he can meet us there.
no roger from op/ed?
mary, we really have to go.
therapist.
dad, you and i have talked about this.  lloyd and i have talked about this.  believe me, this is well-covered territory.
i'm not saying another word.  you damn fool.  he's a journalist.
that's quite a secret.
it would appear so.
throw it in the basket.  what's it say?  "have i got a story! it's getting hotter and hotter. hope you're the same."
yeah me too.
you don't have to say anything, matt ...i know how you feel....
i'm dizzy and thirsty.
we learned he'd found the immigration notaries in liverpool and traced them to new york.  then he figured out the birth records in church hill...
what do you mean, julie?
hello, frances.
i don't set policy.  you have the key?
...it's -- milo, isn't it?
i'll do whatever you want. you don't want me to ever see kayleigh again, fine. just let crockett go. besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. and i know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
and where am i gonna be?
alan
eh...?
you know what they say...the classics are eternal.
hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  i don't make love every ten years, i get a little cranky.
allison, i trust you.  this is your thing.
so you'll be at work?
there's a better place for us to eat.
so the scots will have none of them, will they? my armorers have already made a thousand.
i'd like one of them to say it to you, charlie. i'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. want to hear them?
sir?
nyah still on the property?
i'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that i look at the word "dog" and see "god".
tell me your name?
no, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
uh-huh.
jesus christ you're right.
and if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
um, five.
you don't need to cuff me.
water mains usually go in the winter.  it's august 1st.
i am serious.
alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
oh god, doug.
it's lucky i don't do things the same way. you'd still be standing at the venice pier.
this looks promising...
are you married?
this is one way.
where are you?
all right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
shhh...
what do you mean, too bad?
i wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
thank you, but it's an appointment. i really shouldn't miss it.
contemplate your... panic button.
your career!  what about the lives of those people out there.  simon, what happened to the man i thought i loved?
inspector halloran, homicide.  i'm in charge here.
lock the fucking doors.
two. shaken not stirred.
and a missing man.
now you know.
guys, guys, i'm sorry but, no way.
tree.
you have a good time?
i'm responsible for press relations for the flight office.
well... i proposed them to play roulette...  like we played...  ...and i lost.
what?
shoot him.
shit -- i'm late for dinner... close up, okay?
well, no...but...
we're a team...my...talent. your... mobility.
it's public record.  if the public cares enough to read it.
soon as i rest a bit.  i meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
well, jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. his mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by crystal lake...  people started saying it was jason... back from the dead.
when it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a uv laser going.
what did you say?
then why do you call it harlin's?
i'm good.   really.
what about my neck?
good.  cause we just got some new info and i don't need you getting freaky on me.
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested, i would.
why do you have to see him?
have you ever seen elaine's portrait?
fuck you, johnny utah.  fuck you!! don't you have a soul?  goddamn you to hell!
no. i should have. i told them i disagreed with you, mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original. i'm not lying for you. i'm not gonna shut up for you. not on any of it.
the twenty third of january. on that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
four planes in four days...but i guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from turkey you got...
and my bra finally fits again.
you a lawyer?
yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
after what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
of course, who can nowadays? i have trouble writing a post card to my children! look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
aubrey knows more about us than you think.
wait here.  i'll handle this.
all that at the eagle hotel. it's beyond everything.
-- it was a betrayal.
well, with me, it's all right. i'll kiss you and hug you. you see if i don't.  now mama, mama, stop now. you're gettin' kittenish. mama, listen, i'm gonna sing this like i will if i go on the stage. you know, with this show. i'm gonna sing it jazzy. now get this ...
huh.
get rid of them.
yes.
yeah, i'm feelin' fine.
all right, go.
this is ridiculous, lovejoy. find her.
what are you talking about, raymond? cosmo can't own the moon.
you went out this morning and bought a gun?
no. but tell him i would.
business keeps you on the road?
when?
lord have mercy. that was a good one ma.
- thank you, m. but this is more than your man can handle.  are we in agreement?
you're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
and this shep proudfoot character, he's a little darling. he's now wanted for assault and parole violation. he clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
they're much smaller than bacteria...
not much, jefe. some watermelons.
i don't understand.
no more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
are they standing for me?
and hope to die?
they're nothing but boys.  it will be a slaughter tomorrow.
don't forget your towel.
did mr. marsh use drugs?
keep her out of here while i check it out.
you're a true <u>friend</u>.
jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
okay.  i'll take a raincheck.  i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  listen, that reminds me, i'm having a party for all my clients.  it's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  i know you fill out your own tax return, but i'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
you didn't mind too much.
some people like it.
excuse me?
that's better.  got the radar ready?
i just wanted to get past this &quot;old school marm&quot; image.
some people are afraid of the future; of what might happen;  i was frightened, really frightened.
great. on my fucking room.
but there's plenty of other parts.
yeah, for about a month now.  lenny, just stay away from tran, okay?  and stay away from me.  stop trying to rescue me.  those days are over. i'm a big girl now.  stop trying to save me, okay, because i don't need saving... just... give up on me.
didn't you talk to snow?
would you like to rest now, mrs. brenner.
c'mon tony, waddaya say?
no. i had a girl. she was great. the problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. so i gotta wait another three years before i can even bother to look...
what?
i deal in divorce cases.  corporate investigations...
thought you wanted something fun...
he was going to shoot me!  do you mind?!
great....how long will it go for?
shhh!
it was paradise, michael. you showed it to me. you were there.
no, daddy. our business is journalism. we can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
shit!  don't take this the wrong way, but i used to fuck her.
do you understand me?
i'm real touched.  now get your sunday's on.  we're going for a ride.
i can't see!  how can i fight?
then, you have my thanks, captain charles, for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
a .38.
i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica, what was i supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? yes, i was talking to him.
journalism lesson number one.  if you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
man, the darkest thing they got in there is coca-cola.
she's a little hysterical right now. we've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
mary -- how do you feel?
hello, is this pam?
who said that?
not me.
i don't know.
an eccentric recluse?
don't do that. 
i've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off?
maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
your client is guilty. don't dick around with me.
... and there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your swiss bank account?
nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
what's that?
you do whatever you want. do i keep my promises, or do i keep my promises?
it's that easy?
yes, i know, and i want you to know i thought about what you said... i know you meant it constructively but...
my arm!
i thought i might stop by.
there's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  come on.
just relax.
i don't freak out.
now get talkin'
at a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
yes. and believe me, of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. but none of the other mothers are able to go.
the mission director.
a deal?
and what are you doing?
it was really nice meeting you, jeff. if you're ever in l.a., you should come by the offices. i talked to pony earlier. he said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
yup.
girlfriend?
how do you know? you know her that good?
you loved back?
a hunch -- that's all i've got about this leopard thing. it's just a hunch, yet i feel it deep in the stomach. it was a man!
what makes them think that?
eleven thirty - jesus!
that's perfect.
we just discovered him, your honor! his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! he is an inmate at ossining correctional and --
stop, or i'll burst out crying.
yes.  unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can't afford not to deal with them.
but the most interesting thing here is that i don't see the rose tattoo that i've heard about on your back.
this is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," chapter three --
is that right?
can we call you "weird al"?
look, lady, you saved my life once. i owe you a favor. but i can't understand why you follow a man like that.
quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
i... what do you want?
no, no, not exactly. it isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. not at all. it's a... dairy establishment. you'll 1ike it! i'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
hopefully.
i brought it.
when did you make this, walter?
you work at cook's chicken?
zorro. yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. thought there might be a mexico connection, el paso and all, but nothing. fooled around with the letter "z," turned it on it's side, got "n" -- there ng, he's vietnamese. the only thing that came to mind was zero, not zorro. remember suspect zero?
right here.
i just thought you wanted to get away. i didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
don't equivocate.  be positive. just tell the truth.
my name is john.  now i'm not a stranger anymore.  see how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? i don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
i thought you were a dyke.
that's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
i'm only sorry that i didn't play better for you. i know it would've made you happy. you know what you are?
yes, aaron.  i know the names of the cabinet.
what the fuck is he talking about?
no, i know what you mean. i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. least they make sense. sometimes you think they've betrayed you. like a person would. but then you see, no, you just missed a step. you can go back and make it all work.
soo -- pah doo -- per.
i knew you were going to say that. i don't buy it, and i don't see a case.
pittsburgh, two years ago. partner died, no back-up, i was too gung-ho. as usual.
oh really? nothing? my dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
that's quite all right.  what is it, dear?
like hell you are.
i've got a girlfriend, remember?
bye.
what's the plan?
everything... everything's so funny...
i'm sorry, i --
i mean a human investment, rose, we care about you, you matter to us. but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. do you hear me?
there has to be!
that's disgusting!
you're a beautiful girl, elle.
why would you want to be a cop?
nothing.  i'm here to set you free...
must have opened while i was away at school.
because of what i saw.  who really killed west.
i am. hur you?
talk? once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. and he kept it there. he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. a woman who was watching asked, "what's the trick?" and he replied. "the trick is not minding."
yes.  the thing is... i have to go away today but i wondered, if i didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
like a chihuahua?
it's exactly what you meant.
look at this wiring.  it's shorting out under high temperatures.
my lord. it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny.
manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
look, chum, this is a guy, from what i understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? island hopping, practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth.
then what are you complaining about?  look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "first, the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass. second, the word of god, only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. third, the path of god, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
there's a call i want you to make with me, charles.
your friend was to remain where he was!
look fella...this is private...
she's so nice.
fucking hope not.
be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host.
jesus christ.  that's a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
first night?
it's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth.
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
um-hum ...
agent myers is your new liaison.
that's right! you were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! so don't blame me for how your life turned out. it's not my fault.
fine.  did you have a good time last night?
passionate! he's a pervert. he should have to register when he moves.
after that.
hell naw, willie. them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
what does it matter what i bel- ieve? .. what you gotta worry about is what citrine believes ..
no thanks. why ruin a perfect night.
no, listen, that's my mother, i'm gonna pay for her...
i ain't drinking hot piss with you. come on, sam.
murray said...
you don't know what you're doing.
i loved you so much this day. on my bed in your panties. i remember i thought, how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties.
a trailer was here. what the hell do you think?
you gotta be kidding?
you don't really think so?
where?
nope.
i instruct you to surrender. you are under attack by federation forces.
oh yes, my lady.  all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims... with the holy oil of clovis... for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis...
the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans.  no matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. if we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  in that time we can conquer all of the pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
yeah, and you were--
 listen!  listen...
albert gibson.  three four nine nine one.
martin van buren aldrich and my pa's the only democrat in cross corners. he said you had horns and a tall, mr. webster, but i ain't seen 'em yet.
missed what?
you have my absolute assurance, your majesty, that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st. petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
all right, you got it.
who are you?  the undertaker?
is he okay?
stella.
what's that?
ask for trouble and you get it. why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. then he refused to marry her. why? -- because she only scored sixty-one on a look magazine marriage quiz!
what--it's a bullet. i'm lousy with bullets here.
i don't know what that means.
well, you shouldn't drink. are you gonna drink?
or, it might a been under the mattress.
i've got to find scully.
...people talk to me more.
captain oveur, your navigator, mr. unger, and your first officer, mr. dunn.
amazing!  she still doesn't look over 20. when is she likely to grow old in appearance?
it's him... it's him.
boyfriend?
i should quit this job. i'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
you feel? a soul is what gives you feelings. happiness, guilt, right or wrong. it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us. you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today. you feel these men are necessary. the lord has spoken to you twice this day.
i'm a pilot, will. this is where i belong.
you said they would be here, goddamnit! where are they?
yeah?
i been thinkin about that, too, and i got me a idea.
fuck you, wait a minute. i'm going to-
no, it's weird, man. nobody knows where he went.
but you're the one that wanted to get away. you're the one that came into my cab.
until last night. did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
next stop: the 2:45 to detroit rock city!
servants.  oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
yeah, i think so...
goddamnit, they are out there, david --
he's not telling the truth.
shut up!  fo' i pump this glock in yo' ass!  what did you do wit day-day and roach?
what does he want with a precog?
i don't understand.
tap - tap - tap - tap - what was that - that - that? our echo - echo - echo.
but what if they serve soup?
yeah.
call upstairs, see what you can find out.
what if i keep dropping?
it's a bet--come on, sally!
did that hurt?
my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. i've been married to him for 17 years and i don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what i'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, i'm proposing that you and i do what makes sense. stay warm. pass some time. that's all.
you are always trying to keep it real. i'm in love with how you feel. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
why not?
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
yeah -- it's santa's magic fucking village.  your present's in here.
that depends upon your motive. you were in love with mitchell, weren't you?
so what should we do, father?
sure. that's a good idea. one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
i don't know! i can't see them from here, joel! just pick something good.
right in here. the big show starts in one minute.
let him answer.
parker.  we found him knocked out in the can.
how did you get here?
that's yes?
what did they say?
you give me more credit than i deserve. of course, i'm tempted. who wouldn't be?  but some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. i'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. obviously, some of us haven't.
i love you.
they have. but they never found a lab.
don't be a jerk.  there's no such thing as love at first sight.
what, motherfucker? you drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
a friend?
twenty dollars each time.  hell, it's no secret.  that's what i'm here for.
... and then to reassemble itself <u>combined</u> with the creator. the most certain way of obtaining all the creator's answers.
i'm not gonna mention ricky to him.
her. that look. she likes the ed guy better than she likes the brother.
he did, but... i think i can change his mind.
don't give me that.  you're gonna get plenty rich off of this, mr. 40 percent.  we got those pg&e fuckers by the balls here.
since when? what the hell is this room?
i'm sure you know paul's been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books.
jerry?
my stuff's in the trunk!  god!  you care more about that car than you do about most people.
open a window. every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
when you backed me you needed somebody named deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  hey, folks--
what's goin' on?
mary sue--c'mon ...
i'm fucked!
the two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't maurice miller, is it? i've seen snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
shu's the only one i know of...
they'd have a good neighbor, jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
no, you're just trying to get off.
you're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  what would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, pizza planet?
elektra would control it all.
so this is temporary for you?
we got two paddles.
i'm not going to let this baby die.
you ok out there?
george, if you keep this up i'm going to scream.
ash, you've gotten me enough --
zero did not put it in his bag.    he put it in yours.
thank you, sir.
uh, thanks. god i'm so excited! so, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? he whips out the key, she takes it.
you actually listen to whitney houston? you actually have a whitney houston cd? more than one?
jessica? please hold for my reaction.
and what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
you know i burned all his shit. all that vinyl. chalamar, funkadelic, i burned his turntables too. they was like three-thousand brand new.
you're not going to get in trouble. you're going to find out who you are. finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
did you hear what i said?
you let him pierce his nose?
too many times.
i'll heal.
i turned it off.  it's like an open window he can climb right in...
man veronica, pull the plug on that shit. i say we go with big blue.
see that it is.  take me over, please.
probably. fuck that, i'll sneak in. i need some female vagina tonight.
i... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
we will have to try again. his knowledge is great. without it, we cannot hope to win.
hey, look--
rex won't be any different.  it'll come.
it's ed.
your father must be smart.
you can have it, then. i'm not going back there.
okay. you want me to pick you up?
helluva fuck factor.
he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
he always makes money for his partners.  one by one, our old friends are gone.  death, natural or not, prison, deported.  our friend in miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
oh, you got a problem with that?
thank you, keeper.
good.  now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the adams hotel.
ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  all our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. we would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. now we can say: there is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the doomsday machine.
she's with me.
me, too.
because it's right.
who?
and so now you're off to glades.
if you say so.
you got your riot gun?
okay, okay.  i'll call the girl.
more bullshit!  more bullshit!  what kind of odds are they giving me?  there must be some kind of office pool.  one month?  a couple of days?
i don't care.
this is your room, malcolm. i know you'll keep it clean.
my father-in-law, he's the owner.
what is this? is this a... present?  are you kidding?
chet...
yeah.  well, mostly.
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums. it was a famous case.
i guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
i thought you did.
well, then, i'm afraid i'm gonna have to keep it.
it happened to you before?
in a second...  and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
we've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna. and we want you to be our guide.
where?
agent lowry?
i have no next picture.
very graceful. perfect form.
well, let's spit on it.
he knows better. sunny, apologize to harry.
jennifer, you want to have another drink?
well i've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what i mean?
oh, i see.
who are you?
i can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
busted my cheek but i can still see. what'd you hear?
what in the world would give me that idea?
you got it with you?
you know what, wes?  if you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
call me nancy.
somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so's i could help...
you must agree to be blindfolded...  just for the journey. it might appear unseemly - you’re the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
oh, shut up, rose, eat your cornflakes!
i didn't bust out. they lemme out. howya, noah. howya, uncle john.
but i had heard his wounds were mortal.
i hope those guys are all right.
but don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
nothing... nothing.
anais, it is so good to see you.
i'm...
yes.  yeah, i-i'm kill--
you have the power to do it.  i want you to do it.  please.
jesus.
i'm sure they do - ha ha! but i can't read their serial numbers here. so if you could read me -
i thought you were sixteen.
your great aunt.
what do you think?
double merde.
mr. roebush?
what do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...i'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
and i'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. i'm talking about a great white.
twelve years.  but i'm working on other stuff...
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman. it will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
good.
no, sir.
i think you’re one of the bravest people i’ve ever met.
yeah, i meet a lotta jerks, too.
as much as for a lord?  what an honor!  did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
how long?
who were they?
i don't know -- the gym, the fights. i <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  having some tomorrow night at the state theater.  he use to take me.
what the fuck is going on?
i wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
like that?
yeah. a real tragedy.
she's real.  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall.
well maybe for you.
got a lot of homework?
the grand hotel.
did i?  or was that you?  when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  terrified.  like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  you did that, norman.
and we'll digest our food better.
only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
mom.
correct. i don't.
we in radio contact with anybody up there?
are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
four.
i hate to say i told you so.
oh, make it live -- please, viktor.
sounds like a rough one.
i'm sorry.
you only met him once .
what were you doing in a library?
those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. and if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
why don't you stay here tonight? get a good sleep. you can return to your command in the morning.
they said he was drunk.
most men wouldn't do what he done. if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. they're a bunch of monkeys. i like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
it wasn't me.
maybe.
about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! i'm embarrassed by it. before this happened -- when i'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
i know.
you should have come by last night, radio. you woulda had yourself some fun.
i was trying to get her up wind! that's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
i'm not here to negotiate.
no, sir.
it's okay, honey. i got you. i got you. you're okay.
i warned you...  ...but i'm sorry.
i can't promise he'll hire you. i'll have to tell him about your history.
because they are all the same.
i'm glad of it, honey.
whenever you ask me something why do you always say "let me ask you something?" why don't you just ask me?
you going to let him? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
dammit shermin. earlier you were asking for help. what's changed?
lieutenant garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
you're right.  the killer told me.
let's take a look.
let me do something for myself for a change!
i'm wearing it.
cooper, meet the long lost phillip jeffries. you may have heard of him at the academy.
hi. i'm donald kimball
how long are you planning to stay?
now and then. he gets drunk a few times a year.
-- two million people plugged-in here.
she got herself a husband now. they don' want him 'round. and i tell you, man, i got no use for him neither.
they stole the phones.  they stole the leads.  they're...christ.  what am i going to do this month? oh, shit... 
right. so, this is going to be very formal, too, now. lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares.
no, not yet, not yet. you worry about it for a while, i've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
only the beginning...
we won't have to. the run is tomorrow night.
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
i'll keep that in mind.
your mother's dead, llewelyn.
and it means something else too, doesn't it? i shall never, ever grow up.
i think that's it.
david, come back here!
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
nevertheless, i'd like to see you in my office monday morning.
oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. what about you, mike? are you married - you have kids?
no, i --
you have to!
-- yes?
hey.
we're gonna operate together.
you do?
yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
calm yourself, nurse.  scotty, get us out of here!
no, not yet.
i rather like it myself.  send it right away.
yes, sir, sheriff.
yes, thank you.
but that one time --
i cannot tell you a goddamned lie. she's selling you a pig in a poke. we better do this tonight.
you heard right.
but we heard him.
we ran down that church hill info. she's right.  there is no richard taupin.
not this twig, friend.  i got plans.
sure.  it's a wind-up... thing.
did these guys teach you to talk dirty? huh?
always.
and end up a hunchback like my old man? you think i'm crippled? you shoulda caught him the end of a day.
i'm the one you want!  penguin, please!  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max, not chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
excuse me, sir...?
isn't also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket?  lost everyone on board.  in fair weather no less.
seems like it.
we have to get you to sunnyvale. you're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
not really...
time to start talking.
aaarrrgggaahh.
no. but i've got a penknife. 
of course.
a lot of people died.
will you tell him?
can we stealth these guys?
... i guess i may as well be honest about my feelings, chauncey, as i know you are i am in love with you... i love you and i want you... and i know that you know it and i'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... until...
-- that was the place... and you were the guy.
you know, buddy, sometimes i can't figure you out at all. you can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
any books you like to read for fun?
by the way--did you hear a shot last night?
and he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great admirer of your work..."
no good.  you need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
you're kidding!  what did he say?
an ape ... some kind of ape.
what?
well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what i mean? fuck. so they'll talk and talk. they'll probably talk all night. and, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? but, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. by six a.m. he's parking the pink cadillac. fuck. there's really only one answer.
yes, sir.
you ain't giving the orders here!
shhh. i'll tell you.
i’ll call again.
come on by.
oh, captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  miller dream on, private.
stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; stage three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three. please watch closely.
he can handle it.
you watch your fucking mouth!  mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here!
speakest thou from thy heart?
how long would you need me?
right in front of us. mueller went after him but we held him back.
how much weight have you lost?
'cause when we bought the house it was autumn. this is summer. feed the dogs.
i thought so, too.  joe's a neat guy.
no, no.  just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
you see... i wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. you understand?
well, i'll go home with you.
all right, forget it.  tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
you were adorable.  the least you could do is use a glass.
okay--that's enough!
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
shit...
apologize to elizabeth for me.
that's miles.
come on, lemme load you up...
we can prove that you're not ray dunbar. impersonating a fellow cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
somebody stole it.
never mind it? that's not my money! that's bruce's money!
but then you don't get to watch the ball games. you told me you were a mets fan.
i'm going to tell you a secret now, elaine.  simone is not a real person.  i invented her.
what?
i know what's in here!
he does make some funny noises.
i won't and nothing you say-
oh, a *boy*!
there is one thing left to do... excalibur... and you must do it, perceval. leave my wounds, i command you.
sorry we didn't do better, jack. i feel like i let you down.
don't change the subject! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
this is it.
you're still asking me to break the law.
home, school, here... 
i heard you. but i'm choosing to ignore you. epps, let's go.
upstairs.
i gotta go make dinner.
j.r., glad you could make it.
let's go.
i wish it were.
we hang down here and drop.  the garbage'll break our fall.
insurance. lloyds of london.
i think...  ...i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
but honey, i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
how you doin'?
no, you don't.
well don't worry about it. my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. she won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m&ms. hope you're ready.
did vaughan go home?
is she here tonight?
yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
i could scoop them out.
dad!
oh, yes.
the stock will turn.
thank you.
well, now that is just too bad! curiosity killed the cat.
oh, jesus.  you wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
ted, get a grip on yourself.  you should never have left the hospital.
just my son and i.
fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
now. i'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that drs. towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed...?
there are no twos, max.
and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps.
honey, i don't like to talk about this stuff in front of eric.
i don't want to hear it anymore.
lakeview the deli? oh, shit!
i'm not in here to apologize, john. i told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "good-bye, princess," & the same night she gets attacked? that's a tough one to swallow, bro?
this is where i proposed.
he's a brilliant man. brilliant enough to catch you.
she is but an arriviste.
i don't know.....
what's early been in jail for?
what do you want to do?
what happened?
aye, for us there is.
we'll have to take it easy then. i don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
i'm alright. let's go.
you, too.  happy tossing and turning.
i never agreed to that.
we're done. you did your time. you're a free man.
it's a kiss...  goodbye...
mom, look, don't say anything. first of all, i'm not pregnant.
i'm gettin' married in six weeks. i'll already be in atlantic city which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
press?  no, i haven't.
i'm afraid they'll kill them! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
no.
i told her. i sounded off.
wasn't that cowardice?
gretchen. we're going together now.
do you love me? did you love me? something. i listened to my tape. i can't believe i've been sitting right in front of it for a year. it's like listening to someone else's story. i mean, i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i can't even imagine you naked. i can't even say "naked" to you!
there must be a passage to that other ocean.
i need a vacation.
yes.  ahm... think i'11 ...
hi.
i'm fine.
if you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
weekend after next...
right.  auto-shop, you all set?
same as magruder, i don't like it when they turn out to be human.
i had to...in the games...
my boss is a guy named bobo justus, back in baltimore. when a long shot gets too much action, i have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
and that nasty man that followed us last night.  you didn't kill him.
will she be surprised. i just can't wait to see her face -
bill, rod, wait --
goffredo is the princess' nephew. he's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. and, what do you know -- he paints.
yeah.
he was watching a ball game on television.
yeah. when it freezes, i guess that means the molecules are not moving. so when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. the molecules have stopped. so it's clean.
you know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. that's my advice.
i told you, i've already lived my life. i don't know how or why i'm here, but you have to help me get back. i want to get back to my real life!
did you have sex with her?
they'll get in! we'll all die!
no, sir.
like what?
i'm sorry. i don't understand.
shh.
do it my way.
oh i do... but i say i don't. 
torch it?!
for what?
will you take the job, mr. d'amour?
part of him. painless is the owner and operator of the pride of hamtrack. that's where he comes from... hamtrack, michigan.
<i>                      -- a box? --        is it steel? --                     are there locks? -- is it filled with a pox? --                          a pox! -- how delightful, a pox!</i>
and you will.  but not now.
i don't know -- i was shocked. why did you do that?
jeez, that thing... can't you...
no one else knows
i tell you what. you hit me here.  sugar ray hits me here.  i can't tell the difference. i just fight.
i was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure i could have done it again.
yes?
it tastes old.
is this one any good?
you know that we checked the two ao-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
graffiti --
no.
aren't you gonna do something about it?
helena, please.  this is out of your hands.
your friends.
how very dull, peter parker.
i want to see him.
i'm never smiling again. paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
gus gorman.
lucked out -- got voice mail. everything's cool.
i'm the one who should apologize. i should have talked to you before.
and you could care less --
just out there. roaming around. building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
what do you mean, help?
will you stop it! sorry to disturb you, miss...
you know what your problem is?  you're just too adorable...
and do princesses do improper things?
really?  which precious homily was it?
mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
i know, i'm sorry... i-i've been really busy...
she is always aphrodite.
i work alone.
anything happens to huey it ain't gonna be a finger. i'll...
no.
you mean he withdrew...
blow me.  have i said that to you guys recently?  blow me.
no...
course i'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  nice drinkin' liquor.
no. that's cool. bring me back eighty.
y'know, i told myself a million times i didn't want to be a fireman. i said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. i know i split, and i know how you felt...
miles.
just sending a message.  she'll get the point.
try.
the one who came with your letter?
yeah, i suppose. but you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
are you?
briefs.
not exactly.
i don't think so.
don't know, mon. this is a jumpship. not meant for transport.
you know, i just can't do that anymore.  i still have time to get things right.  get married again --
so what do we do?
decent?  i guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
and am i not fair?
that's exactly why we need them.
rob, i just want you to know, you're the only one i can talk to about her.
i don't care. she's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
i know.
did you kill him?
that road--and those orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
--you've done worse than let haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--i didn't think that was possible. a conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. you build from the outer edges and you go step by step. if you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. you've put the investigation back months.
what?
you 're so --
yes, we've been through death and life together.
yes, hi i'm laura, i'm a trained counselor. how can i help you.
look, man, it... shit. why don't we get something to eat? i mean food?
with a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  y'ever read your shakespeare, bill?
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
yes, of course. the hash browns are delicious. i'm just...not... ordering them.
good, i believe you already know my, uh, son --
bob, that makes no sense.
how can i help you?
she's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  could i ask you to step outside, please.
yeah.  this is one for ripley.
now you'll be mine, cindy.
can you do the lock on it?
have you thought at all about your plans?
paul it's telly. open up.
but these are white people, anybody. the punch...
six weeks. but who's counting?
what, and get myself beaten up again?
no great lady will ever take my place?
i'm in san francisco five days a week. with a lot of time on my hands. i'd like to see you.  maybe we could go swimming or something. mother tells me you like to swim.
i thought you might paste them into your book.
just cover me. it was built to move.
you bet i will. and when i tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  you fink!
how often does he get like that?
the retard over at molly's fruit stand.
oh.  you need a cappuccino.
can i bring kenny?
doing what?
well, then... i hope we don't run into any tonight.
what?
i want a martini! on this bar, right now! i've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and i'm not about to --
mr. sulu, steady as she goes.
oh yeah? how exciting. what's it called?
do we have to?
nothin'. salvy was out of line. he was drunk or somethin', i dunno. anyway, the windup was i gave him a beatin'. tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. it's all forgotten about.
no.
his . . . whatever.
life is a burden for me.  nothing gives me any pleasure; i find only sadness in everything around me.  it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
clark, i think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
you sick bastard!
yes, i do. i love them!
is that everybody?
mon general, i have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  i am serving without salary.
sir?
right!
that's what you need!
chick's nuts about you. how long did you date caitlin?
who did?
one day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. the first saint of our century. that's a prayer, too. a catechism. something the priests tell us to believe.
i'll deal with her later.
edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
there's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  what if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? do they converge at all?
uh, atomic energy?
randal...?
yes, sir.
she doesn't answer me either.
dr. gruber ...
jack, no. i just explained the whole thing to you. it was just between me and salvy, if it had anything to do with you and vickie, i woulda told you about it.
that's their problem.
uh-uh.
i've died once already.  it wasn't so bad -- in fact i recommend it.
sorry, boss—
don't dramatise.
you swore you'd fire me if i came in late again.
sid, this is detective kincaid.
tubbs, these people mean business.
this morning i didn't know how badly i'd want to get out of this fucking town.
come on, jack.  it's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  it'll be like when we were kids.  relax.  enjoy the view.
she's evil.  she's brilliant.  be careful, nick.
will you come here?
so you are! the place is a pigsty all the time.
precisely, meeks. greek for the herd. however, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
we have to keep moving.
you have my word. paul?
i told you! i've got everything!
well, it isn't.
it boils down to respect. people just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. they have no sense of real commitment.
betting table twelve off the paddock. nyah, are you up to this?
i couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
party?  oh no, i can’t go to a party...
slip it in ...
well, sir, consider the possibilities. a:  ryan is alive.  we have to take him back to the beach.  knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
c'mon, thel.  so charley had a little fling.  so what? all in all he was a pretty good husband.
that's bullshit, jeff!
uh, huh?
<u>i</u> ruined?  with all due respect, i told you to abort --
she said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
a leader, like laszlo?
oh, you know the old story -- the hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to saratoga. some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
we're going for a walk.
except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
knock yourself out.
okay. thank you.
you already did.
a future. the only future i've got.
roger.
i'd like a little wine, if you have it.
in a legal sense, yes. but not actually. actually, i'm innocent. i didn't do anything.
i can't write this anymore.
jim, in your absence, genesis has become a galactic controversy... until the federation council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of genesis... consider it a quarantined planet. and a forbidden subject.
it is every woman's problem.  who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  who...
well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
he's dead.
nice ensemble!
the contract was stolen.
and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
glenn, i know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  put your hands on the wheel.
think of them as death shrouds. and the moaning is important. really <u>moan</u>!  practice, practice, practice.
yup. claire... please, please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
you sunk my battleship.
this is general ripper speaking.
is he?
guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
i don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
shoulda, coulda, woulda...  get him in the water.
it's engineered to last about fifteen years.
you're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from lula.
yes. up here on the fifteenth floor. goodnight.
i don't know. as a child. i longed for a father and now —- i don't know ——
if it's the british minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some madeira --
how much have you got?
what am i supposed to say?
you can't be too careful. i've been stalked. i've been told i'm highly stalkable. i don't need that.
what does time travel have to do with philosophy?
get out of here!
you ask me out here to sell me your house, frank?
i don't know.
sattler.
in this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
yes, even i had a mother. she was part austrian, but she was still my mother. my childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
the mountains are solid granite. we'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to bixby if we have to.
a couple of days later. it was fierce. you guys never saw it.
no question of her loyalty.
you're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
buddy, it's not a question of enough. it's a zero sum game, sport. somebody wins and somebody loses. money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. like magic. that painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. i could sell it today for $600,000. the illusion has become real. and the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. capitalism at its finest.
it smelled.
what would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
i'll send you a muff.
yes.  there is nothing more comfortable.
i'm a quick learner.
you've no need of your weapons with me gurney halleck.
because he'll kill me.
oh, so you feel that way too . motions to other room. stay in there--i'll call you when needed.
isn't he here?
well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
-- ok?
it is wildness and freedom. no one can touch it.
that's logical. and if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. saves you money, too.  so what's this story you're working on, anyway?
fuck you.
two are still missing.
not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why i blew her off... i need your help, max.
this could trigger the impeachment. they'll go to the supreme court next.
obviously someone else knows it!  get everybody back to their posts -- now!
guess that makes you pretty special.
what're you, nuts?
you... oh god, why?
look, fuck the border. let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
"i'm telling you god's words, not to hustle."
yeah.
i wanna get a job.  i wanna work at club med.
my grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. been out riding. must be the good air. you oughta see that little booger eat.  i'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  molly's out in the motor home...
wear it until you love it.  and die in it!!
no. you listen.  i had my doubts about you from the beginning
james.  it wouldn’t really be...
what's that?
do you know this man? is there something between you?
but ed, we're not even married.  and you don't have a job.
what?
what is it?
oh, no no no! it's just the horn resounding is...
there's no time to explain.  get everyone together!  we found a way to the pods!
i guess the news you’d sent me after friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
be my guest.
fine.
you didn't buy batteries?
you set me up.
of course... i haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
ok. but late.
that's not dirt...can't be dirt.. dirt is a violation.
listen, there's things i can take and a couple things i can't and one of them i can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything i want to be, starts losing faith in things. i saw your eyes last night.  i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? i'm serious.
we need to put out an ncic inquiry.
the wife killer?
sounds like they make tennis rackets. what do we know?
dear god.... how did i come to this?
what's the matter? legend has it bandit larue's king of the road.
you're tough, j-man.
huh.
i just want to pick up my divorce papers. for the lawyer. it won't take long.
i told you, he's one of dino velvet's stock players...
but alas poor romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter tybalt?
good. we'll sell tickets.
in some situations.
but he's got a loud bark. that's the most important thing is a loud bark.
come on. booth grabs the bag --
you ask him if you like, but i would leave him to it if i was you.
all right, you didn't know.
uh, huh.
don't touch it! get back in that tub!
i have no interest in your body, mr. boone.  i can assure you of that.
yes, sir, he has. the usual -- india's salt belongs to india -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the dharasana salt works.
no... forget it...
if beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe beynon's boys will be waiting for us in el paso.
and, you seem in excellent health, your highness.
i believe in miracles now.
"bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
did someone say i wasn't nice?
one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
i'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
no ... metropolis is a confusing place. back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
no... could you?
and where are they now?
well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then i could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
i've never heard of her. maybe something else was on his mind.
it's anna sui, you should be doing it.
well, dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
but why?
well, i, for one, like cheese.
you've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
i'm a junior.
we do have a man for you.
no -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  but how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
that's not a bad place to start.
sheila...
he wouldn't leave her.
and if it got to clark... clark could have gotten to anybody.
sheriff, this is no time to panic.
watch me, grandma....
let's go.
not in your condition.  make it tepid, gaston... tepid and tender. and lay out his gray suit.  afterwards i'll drive you through the bois. slowly... in waltz time.
call the police?
i know, i know. i had no idea --
not that i know of.  why?
the hell you do.
i know it is.  right after my parents died, i went to the beach...  i was in the water.  everything was calm.  and then one of those really big waves hit me.  hard.  pulled me straight to the bottom.  i struggled and finally ran out of air.  if it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, i would've drowned. legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
well, i want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long i could pick up the phone, call murray and i'd have your job.  you know that?  not too long ago.  for what?  for nothing. "mur, this new kid burns my ass." "shelly, he's out." you're gone before i'm back from lunch.  i bought him a trip to bermuda once...
getting eaten!? that was your plan!?
it plays in 50 states.
tomorrow.  the buyer is japanese. his retirement a condition of the bonus.
jesse. what are you thinking? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
freddie miles. you know -- he's organizing the cortina skiing trip.
john...
i may be a shut-in, but i do not lack for news. i'm sorry you had to go through all that.
oh, sorry, right.
they call me steve, but i prefer shenge.
really?
listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
mkay, kids from all over the state have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. uh, young man... let's start with you.
you mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
no! i just wanted
not exactly.
i am.
an answer.
nine ball.  three ball.
no, i'm dumber than a goddamn slug. now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
please, be quiet.
jesus christ, there's norma stern. look at her hair.
of course i am.
take it easy. take a deep breath.
a guy named walker. amazing person. he's developed a huge following.
long gone, huh?
yeah.....hey they're moving....  am i doing that?
i didn't say fuck him. i'm just not connected anymore.
yeah.
whatever.
no.  what's my cut?
maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word i hate?
the first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
don't tell me, i know about these things.  i've seen it before.  it's all right.  it's... all right. you're here.  oh, god, i love you, son.
i need morphine.  a lot.  and a pistol.
consider him part of your crew. consider him a part of me.
it's private.  go away.
and i saw that i was alone.
yup.
thank you, but i really have to go.
well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
can't remember shit. crs.
always wanted to see the upper lines.
three, four thousand...i don't know.  the guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
don't crowd the house.  the alpha's a kid named rooney.  he's amped up and volatile.
she told me i had to get back the check or call the state's att...
they are... sinister.  they want to kill me.
i thought the gloves were off.
i'm going out!
mcmanus was furious. he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. that night we got the call.
where are you going? you'll freeze out there. you don't even have a coat.
well, i would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, mrs spitz. i wouldn’t like to think i’d kept you waiting for nothing.
find them everywhere. 
velma.
don't be stupid george. obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. she might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
so, i don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
clarence, you do a good job with george bailey, and you'll get your wings.
yes. your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
always, for you, baby.
oh, well, i'm goin' uptown, too.
why would the union--
but you don't keep a cat, do you?
but who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
fine. i'll check out in the morning.
i can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
yes!
no.
my morn was a delta.
oh, suzette -- suzette -- sshh -- quiet.
so?
they're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
unlock one of the other storage rooms.  we're going upstairs.  we'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
have another glass of something good, toddy.
it was a gift. it isn't worth anything at all?
no -- actually i'm just looking for a friend.
so we kill him?
i prefer to be called rozengurtle by men.
i didn't do anything.
sure i'm alright. 
i need to do it.
yeah, well, i lost my pen. by the time i got a new one, i was clean out of paper.
no thanks.  i'd like to break away--
you seem pleased by the prospect.
what's that?
you are me.
i just got out of a six-year relationship. okay? that should help to explain why i'm acting so weird. it's not you. it's me. i just wanted to say that. sorry.  this is mike. 
usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
i don't know.  end up in the electric chair?
i brought the money, monsieur blaine.
i just know how you get. good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
what happened? jason bourne happened.  you've got the files? then let's cut the crap. it went wrong. conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find bourne, couldn't adjust. it all went sideways. finally there were no options left.
get out!
luca could still be an accomplice.
--otherwise we may have to--
yeah?
no -- but i can get it for you.
end my career?
piece of cake.
being violently ill to her tummy.
no.  i mean, i'm telling you: i'm telling you that i have love.
okay, but i don't want to miss him.
there's no witnesses...
that you didn't die?  like the other children?
i didn't know your size.
i don't want any...
then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
sure, what is it?
-- forgive me, mr. taransky.  i'm just trying to understand.  all these films, tv appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  this is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
am i...?  would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
you really say the cutest things.
i didn't ask for a dog.
your new friends.
oh, yeah.  "the philosophy of time travel". what is this?
if you say so.
did we win or lose, i mean --?
i don't know.  i've been back and forth with narragansett naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
make it the way i always do.
very.
you have family here also?
yes, yes, happy to meet you.
he's right.  we hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
we can't all get up and leave, can we? i mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
hi.
lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that i don't get somethin'! i never get somethin'!
i like it.
but it's in the back.  why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
let's do some research. i'll check the libraries. you surf the web.
the prefix code is 16309. all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
no, please, not again.
yeah i want something.  i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
hardly.
yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  that makes everything...
i work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
yeah, sure, i guess.
doesn't she look pretty?
of course, not, charlie. i never thought you did.
sorry, captain. the ribbon has already entered the galaxy. it will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
couple hours from idaho. we'll cut across to montana. i've got friends there with a ranch.
i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. they are very interested in the case. swana suspects her countrymen.
yes, my lord.
shoot. they don't call me the wizard for nothing.
all right... i want you... to... kill... sailor... as simple as that.
sell it all.  what the hell, so i'll only make ten million.
the what?!
you've got a warped thought process. your brain doesn't function properly.
in here. with us.
some.
uh, i probably will, but not you. you're too much of a butt-monkey. huh huh.
i'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
what?
but attractive--
i checked it out. it's clean.
i don't eat waffles.
snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  i'm sorry, lee, you never had a chance.
toni blake from langley p.d.
liar. just tell me who the bank card belongs to. name and address.
in downtown sydney for a start.
do this for me, marla.  do this for me, if you never do anything else...
it's a waste of time.
be cool. fake it if you have to.
which convent?  it was, um, the little sisters... of the moonlight.  in vegas. everybody used to come to mass.  frank. dean.  sammy.  right at ringside.
twenty-seven, fifty.  that's all i got.
do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion?
well, it isn't exactly the term i'd have chosen, but i suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
oh...
and look what i've got for you. an electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
i'm willing to take that risk.
pardon me?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. let's just watch it and think about it. 
oh.  no.
morning. any calls?
well, how do you know? did she discuss it with you?
that's not true.
i don't mind. if we give them something to talk about.
you can't keep bringing up starbucks. that was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
well, sure, if you are, margaret...
i'm different.
it's queens, dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--i gotta live in manhattan to be a player, dad. there's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. one day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
and the landy woman?
what?
it's suicide.
good.  let's get dry.
what?
annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and misery's spirit is still alive--
we wait.
turn that thing off, will you?  it's driving me nuts!  what's rosebud?
it's that jerk walter.
you were going to can me, right?
well, ya can't complain i never take you anyplace.
letting him use your toilet? no store does that.
i just always did like truck rides.
the sonofabitch. the blackmailer. it's, uh, it's no one you know. it's a businessman from sacramento. a goddamn pansy, ed. he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell. and the very next day, the very next day, ed, i get blackmailed for the same amount.
i'm not scared of you, max.
i am a doctor. i teach medicine.
what's the kid gonna say - sorry? meanwhile i'm not here anymore. like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  who knows?  but some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me. sooner or later.  that's me.
you are woman.  i know woman well.
i want him back!
"stuff."  were the mid-terms hard?
it's a little late.
it wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
"i can always find someplace else to work. someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the french riviera ..."
what do you want?
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
ally.  that was my nickname.
good, because you're going to harvard, and that's the end of it.
what right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
get the fu-  you threatening me?  i'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  get up and go home right now.
you got it.
how long 'til they reach us?
you can starve to death for all i care. now shut up, the game's about to start.
no! not the camera guy!
that is unfortunate.
water turning to blood.
why can't i be like you jack? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it.  say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
if anyone deserves it, it's spengler and me. we're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
well, bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... i couldn't have asked for a better specimen. i mean you don't know what a dry spell i've had, total block...  ...total block... but bill he's ok.
no.
no more waiting in coffee shops ...i promise.
emily, you -
you promise you'll write.
it's a mess.
it's a wonder i'm not panic stricken.
so you're hoping buzz can get you re- instated?
two.
don't be silly, anyone can dance. here, just follow me... watch my feet.
as long as you keep overpaying me, i'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
you're sweet.  and sexy.  and completely hot for me.
i'm okay. go back to your friends.
benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
forget it.
oh, what?!...what?!  these are plastic.  he can't fly!
creasy, how old are you?
if i stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her madame butterfly routine--
and you sure you can control this thing?  last time didn't work out so well.
and fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
shit!
eggs he asks me for. oranges. what you need is a good horse-whipping.
how can you be sure?
maurice left.  tia's taking a bath.
how sweet.  is that when you put the move on her?
nice to meet you.
i know.
yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. what do you want?
"a toast then, jedediah, to love on my own terms. those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
well i'm real happy for you, cobb. but i think i'll keep looking for mine.
he got away. i had him. he got away.
i'm worried.  the vibrations could shake her to pieces.  we should have padded her feet.
what?
how about you?
no, somebody powerful.  oh.  look. what's that up there?
not at all.
once more! 
me.
you were right jahn, it's a great space..... hey, chris. do you want to come and look?
two at a time?
and i'm grateful for you, frank, especially with those boors around. we've grown very close in a short time.
so he says now! but if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
yeah, guess so. how'd you know?
but that's what happened.
i heard enough.
i know.
if it's about the bikers, dear, i don't want to talk about it.
no.  he would give it away.  i know how to repay a consideration.
uh ... oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building ... and they're most unusual.
why?
peace out.
then if you won't get out, i'll have you thrown out.
let me be sick... i want to get up. get me something to be sick in... stop the film... please stop it... i can't stand it any more. stop it please... please.
how do you explain the part about beauregard?
look, girls -- i'll stay behind and hold them off. the rest of you break for it!
yeah?
yes. i'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore.
no.
eh, joey, even you don't know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why'd you say them? you coulda said anybody.
sing!
i understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. but that's not pg&e's fault.
david, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? do you really?
i don't think you're normal.
i know, man.
i, actually yes.
i'm here.
my name's sondra.
five.
that's an outrageous lie!
sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! only you expected it to be like other marriages. it can't be like other marriages -- we're different! we're a different world. look at what we went through today. i wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. i bet you wouldn't, either.
truth'll set you free.  i'm listening.
do you have a, ah, film called 'slave of love?'
i have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge.
really. so you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
i came this far alone ...
well, i guess i'll...get down to the station.  it was lovely meeting...
yes, doolittle.
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet?
forget her. you could do better than my sister.
how long?
be careful!
over... my... dead... body!
good.  that's enough.  we'll do the rest on thursday.  that's a good girl.  it's always such fun to see you.
well, thank you anyway.
john—
would they do that?
but my penalty. i've got to have a penalty.
not since you lost him.
and you've always loved him?
no punch line.  maybe i was just admiring your know-how---yours and falco's.
yes, joe.
you’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. it’s a whole world, sid. you’re really popular amongst the demented.
you're paying the bills.
yeah. way north.
you heard me, smith. peters, are you with me?
this is my case.  get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
i threw my back, again.
you're foreigners.
if you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
fuck legal terms.  we're talking about human beings here.  sick people.  a whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  they need their money now!  we gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, ed.  we gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
well, perhaps you can help?
grab hold!...
whaddaya mean what do i wanna know? i wanna know everything.  who's this screwball laplante for pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? you're supposed to be on top of this, gale, don't...  "quit!"  you can't quit!  it's unprofessional!
what do you mean 'free'?
when does he graduate high school?
yes, sir.
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
-- wait a second --
yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, i don't care how soused he was. that's like drowning in a teaspoon.
how- i don't want you to live with me? how- whose idea was it?
uhn! uhn! uhn!
the chancellor's here? now?
i didn't know if it was a trick. they might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  i am hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
get in.
no, that's quite all right.
keep it together, claude. you wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
you've just said you signed it.
and what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
you wasn't with her?
because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  was never found.  so we have to ask...
you, preacher?
that is the point... and skipper'll slip off the hook.
totally. she came apart like a house of cards. they dropped the charges...
superman gets mail here?
indeedldid, mylord. itwas one ofthe first to cross.
i'm sorry, i can't help it.  it's too funny.
we gotta get out and fire a flare.  it's the only chance!
maybe i did... i don't remember.
and so i was yesterday. and the day before.
then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
no, i'm good, angelo.
i don't know, but close.
boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  wait a minute, i'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
alex?
so what?
me, too. i'm taking miss kubelik out -- i finally talked her into it --
and you believe that?
okay.
how long you been at it?
no! i... i checked when i put my stuff in. i always look through the washer first.
that's doable.
yeah, i did.
yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. then the pms should be over.
thanks for lying.  but you're the class officer, wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  besides...
but they'd still get the idea, right?
a million at least... if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major, you'll be able to name the reward...
if you want to hire me, i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about.
nice tattoo, dietz.
i think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
what?
she didn't hand you to me.  she doesn't even know who you are. she told me about lisa henderson.
oh, just the basement. some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. it will save me from intrusion.
who gives a goddamn what you think? you're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... you're not even a name anymore. just a spear- chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
richard, i had to see you.
it happens, larry. people make mistakes.
jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
she can take care of herself. she doesn't need you.
he's right. the tapes give us leverage with bastaldi.
it was alive?
what do they say?
well, then what are you doing here?
shut up. have you got your passport?
you're certain?
i heard you were looking for me.
know what ? that it was your fault ?
i don't know if i should talk about this.
why should i worry?  is there a problem?
exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. you only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
so that was it.
trudy and i are goin' for gina...
no... they didn't survive only to be your food.  you did that.
oh wow. yeah. that's great. you came, you came. what are you doing?
no cursing in this house, young man. use the strong vocabulary god gave you.
it ain't for lack of trying.
yes, sir.  i'll talk to helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this watergate thing?  what do i tell ziegler to tell them?
but who was the devil?
i'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, mr. gardiner.
who said i was jealous?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
there -- you're a new man.
naw.  i'll take the zero.
young. i feel young, doctor.
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. alex breaks away again.
that's where i get off.
we'd never make it. they're probably all over the road.
the sun.
coffee?
listen, i'm the one help jack escape from prison.  he tole me, i can't find him to see you.  so why don't you open this fucking door.  okay?  so we can speak.
sire, i swear to your majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. i have taken out everything that could give offense. i hate politics.
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
larry sellers, a high-school kid. real fucking brat.
well, that's a relief. you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
what i have to do is get in my bed and lay down. i want to fix on something harmless in this world.
marvelous.
yes.
i went over last night, too.
no -- no -- no -- no...
i might know where you could get a copy.
come on, don't you screw with her, please!  you... you got to want this: armored car job.  caltrust bank. they took two million in cash...
she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
oh yes, and who are you? he's worked for kings. for the emperor.  who are you?
it's a bit more like how can we help you. bay area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. and... well mr. hoover wants to reiterate that the fbi will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. on a strictly advisory basis... of course.
as long as it records i don't give a shit. we're not doing a remote.
you don't know?
whatever happened, whatever he did -- i know it's my fault and i know i can never make it up to you --
okay, plan b.
take my number.  when you see me -- call me and i'll walk you through the exchange.  it's 308-9962 -- repeat it back.
uh, dad, you know i'm 16.
sir, i speak to you as a kindred intellect. do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation?
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? the lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.
let's just find coalmine.  listen, zenovich made a mistake. you didn't let anybody down. it happens –
the climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
dead... they're dead... and buried.
he's dead.
that's right.
your daughter.
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
um--hello? you want to like take a look?
not with strangers.
all right, all right. you can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
no, sir.
will -- it'll go worse for us -- for elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
didn't you know this is my home town?
ginger's mission in life was money.
it shouldn't be any harder than general motors was. but now...this is what i get for using humans.
some of it good, i hope.
when you fall asleep tonight, i'm gonna fart in your face.
it's every bit as hard as they say. unless you're a genius like meeks.
nah, sounds too "needy."
what.
thank god...
had a letter from my wife.  the wisteria is still out, which i'm looking forward to.  she says dorset is gripped with invasion fever.  wrong coast i should have thought, still…
here's to my last week of freedom.
i expect some kind of loyalty here. just because i fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
don't let it out of your hands again.  can the kid walk?
ha ha ha. no really, where does it come from?
the sun also rises.  for whom the bell tolls.  the old man and the--
explains the private detective. he traced her to the bates place.  what'd he exactly say when he called you?
no teammates in football?  no comrades in korea?
michael, come on, don't be silly. this is the quickest way.  you're not going to walk all the way around?
twenty eight years ago.
what's wrong?
he'll pinch my cheek. i hate that.
yeah? you like?
i suppose so.
yes you did. you been putting it up your whole life. you just didn't know it. you know what date is on this coin?
he was here for four days.
you need a baby-sitter.  that's what i'm here for.
okay, a lot of bad luck.  but that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  this is no time to give up.
i'm so relieved.
happy hanukkah morty.
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
pffft!  absolute nonsense.  the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear mr. garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  as you well know.
not a sou. i had some before the fainting scene.
it saved my father!
amado.
mr. president, there is another possibility we haven't considered. this may not be a coup at all.
drop the bogus forgery charge and i'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
we're not going to sleep out here, are we?
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
tell matt he should be here....
i just want to know, that's all.
oh -- but it can't be.
hope not--if he is, he's dead. let's go to the newspaper office.
old, yes. but interesting.  do you mind if i ask a few questions...?
me first?
hey... sheila.
no thanks!
let's go...
hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down.
remarried.  there is no move.
and they don't call my parents?
don't even.
you're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked.  that angelic little face wasn't me at all.  i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. sometimes words were enough -- but i wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was.  that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you.
message to proteus.
now you're catchin' on. don't wanna get your daddy in hot water, do you?
how different?
two tourists who never went home.
yeah, it was.  for a writer nothing's sacred.  no, nothing at all.
how about me?  do you think if i concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day i might be a putterer?
uhura, i had the strangest dream. i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise.
oh, how do you mean?
just like old times, ain't it?
nevermind.
you know about this stuff?
i'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
and the marriage - is that a fiction? 
you've never been out of boston.
cliff brumby. he'd seen the film. he wanted to meet doreen.
i can trust my brain.
yeah, it's me.
no.  we keep it in the backyard.  of course, in the house.  it's in there.
yeah. sort of. daddy rounds 'em up. you aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
steven schwimmer. i memorized every word of this review.
what do you mean?
because you should be home with nintendo, listening to the spice girls, little man ...
i'm gonna take him, goose.
say who?
deanna, stand by.  open a channel.
no lloyd. chicks are for fags - i'm not going to do it.
they're putting it on at henley hall. see, open try-outs.
no, slink --
[it's a moral issue. on one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
what are you going to do?
he said...
i got a message on my machine to meet gus here.  where is he?
it was his idea.
expect it.  did you get anything from the room?
i can hire workers to help me.
size has no meaning.  it matters not.  look at me.  judge me by my size do you?
any minute.
the hard-core four million "nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... they'll say i sold out to the communists.
i just want to make an honest woman of you....
you won't.
sweeney?  well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
andersonville.  they did horrible things to men there...
forget it, judy.
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
like you said, mr. deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  the voight-kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
oh, yes. on the pier.
how's that, buddy?
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her. today i found out such strange things ——frightening things. i saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— i feel as if i'd never known her.
you bet, terrance!
it's all connected, pop. it's one life. baseball is memory. how do fathers and sons show their love? they go to a ball game together. thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
i've got a right to carry a gun if i want to.
a record of the arrests...
well, it's not really mine. i dug it up in front of the courthouse. we're transplanting it. letting it breathe, you know. but, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
sit down, frank.
i could give it some thought, ben, but my leg is very sore.
it really didn't hurt that bad having him.
what's all of this got to do with me?
not always... look at me... i've been back twice. 
there's nothing ridiculous about it.  a kid like you...
you missed a button.
yoo-hoo! travis and bob head. whoo-hoo!
i don't give a damn.
you're a peculiar chap.
not likely i am afraid; i don't think i'll be seeing them again.
you will.
deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, wally.
where?
i feel better if i move.
gibarian warned me.  he left me a message.
donald w. blackburn, m.d.
you don't say!  why i had no idea -
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid.
criminal.
i guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  they don't speak that way on television.  it's a rule.  do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
tell him i'm at lunch.
so?
what's wrong?
that's me.
you know all about me.
forty dollars.
half - i'm comin' down. 
send for goebbels.
i think so. something besides your husband's death was bothering you. you were upset but not that upset.
survive today, that's the point.
i suppose we'll make an appearance.
so i have to watch jamie tonight.
you have a right to be angry.
what do you want -- ?
there are three men dead.
you're amazing.
...and figure out how to reverse them. let me show you to your rooms.
i do....
but?... but? there is a "but," nathan.
i'm not interested in blind dates.
i'm sylvia. what's your name?
not much.  there's no sign of a break in.  i think she let him in.
he moved out to rancho cucamonga with his cousin day-day.
they did it... they assimilated earth.
you didn't marry donna reed.
you can't bluff me, burns. i don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
jus' playin' the game, sucker...
my mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "what?"
geller, this is way out of your league.
anything?
time's running out...but i'm obliged to you.
you know of him?
now?
sorry. do you suppose susan could just bring her crutches? oh, stupid question. tell her i hope  she feels better.  susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
nice.
what?
it's over a month.    the police say it happens all the time.
maybe later.
sixty-nine cent.
sure thing.
but you're a girl, thank goodness.
goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  did the cops go in?  did smith have the disks?
if you'd had the sense to ask for my help, i might've helped you. but you've probably scared chuckie roeder off for good, i have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. now.
mccluskey can't stay with the turk forever.  we'll wait.
we gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
he's decent.
did you see that guy?!  he was right in the middle of the road!
and how much did you say you wanted for this... what did you call it? a finder's fee?
no, only the path she chose to travel.
may i continue with the rearing of my son?  load that gun!
the fools! if they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
what?
thieves.
i call this the staccato. 
jesus!  why didn't you tell me?
what?
not me, bones... they did it.
don't interfere.
as you wish.
are you kidding?  don't be ridiculous.
because i'm an idiot. how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? none! only a jerk like me could do it. besides i wasn't lucky. when i was a kid there was the war! when i grew up, another war! now it's all different. times have changed. and you want to be a dope like me? huh? answer me!
sure, sure.
commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? these were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
can you - ?
he's dead...?
you'll know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.
look at him.  you think he played it square?  how much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
a hundred and one, i think. every day she does the same thing. but there's never any mail.
ah, history i think.
thanks.
maybe you did it yourself.
no, i don't hate it.
sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. he suggested i kill you rather than him.
just a few then. the big ones.
i ain't no preacher anymore.
you can't, convict!  you're just a shmoe!  every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?"  it's a natural inclination.  but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! you are on my planet!  you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!
what?
i'm aware of that, but i don't think he's in any condition to make requests. i'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, father.  i'm concerned about harm to my patient.
well, has your majesty considered what napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
i have some friends who have had a accident--
what?
no.
i'm late for the dedication.  then i go after freeze and ivy.  alone.
uh-huh.
i love you.
i'm telling you, i saw it...
no, i don't.
does rachel make a lot of money?
don't i? ... say, that's mighty white of you, jabez.
oh?
i know.  she needs to slow down.  she's going to blow an o-ring.
and i know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
the hell you are.
what about you and grandpa and everyone in hell?
it's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
we just lost main power... and we've got class-three alerts all over the ship. i'm not sure what's --
that's lieutennt hurwitz. severe shell shock. he thinks he's ethel merman.
no, no, see dr. grant, you're the best. you've seen these animals in the flesh. no one else has come close to you.
no.
in this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  in face, it was a pretty damn good idea. just don't make a habit of it.  and, as for ms. hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  i'm assuming you approve.
i knew it was you --
oh, i'm making investigations.
you don't regret meetin' your wife?
so we understand each other?
no... not like you and doctor crusher used to be.
stick?
what are you, nuts? you think she's coming back?
on your own land?
not yet. what do you know about it?
bontecou wants a quick response and --
hi, rob.  it's your mother.
he ran in fear from us . . .
hello? is this me? i'm trip. am i on the air?
am i? why, i - i don't know any reason why i should be, unless of course it's you . . .
i can't take that job! i mean, i mean, i can't take it right away. i'm still recuperating, i just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
our operatives in brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
it's not a discharge.  right, edmunds?  you said before, right?  so it's gotta be a message.
she was looking right at me.
all right, lothat, that does it.  master safety on now until bomb run.
yeah.  what are you going to do? that toby's a hot head.
we need to get out of sight.  come down to my suite.
i would like to marry you.  but i have already promised myself... to god.
i'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. i think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
you're fired.
i had been sold to the english.  i'd rather die than fall into their hands.
my god--
i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can't i?
you're very rude... if you don't come back --
seventy.  but i want blood and gore.  you know, sexy stuff.
doctor?  what could be wrong wit' you?
he ain't doin' the right thing. he's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. can't you make him understand that?
hey. it's me.
why not?
what?
we're just trying to figure out what happened.
we already have a super-tanker.
you're a pal.
no trouble.
i was afraid to ask.
baby, you treat me so good. peerless, you're a good son, i love you.  you never gave me no trouble.
i pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
hey, rip van winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
if you help me, i am prepared to help you. anna martins always said you were a fool...
why.
let them eat static.
treat to be here.
i'll come with you.
at the way you ask funny questions, josie mae!
yes he is.
what's the matter, wendy?
not dr. barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
hey, kind of giving up christmas day for my ex-boss here.
then you shall die.
yeah, important for your label. which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. you'll make out.
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs.
...finish out the game, bud, push yourself...
hi.  this is heather langenkamp.
yeah.  yeah, yeah, yeah.
is there another key?
hi.
have the money ready by 11am. we’ll call you.
looking for shrapnel.
let's get out of this cold.
--turn the camera off--
listen, you need me.
oh, yeah?  well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
that never stopped you before.
really.
they're still in the house.
but how would we pay our bills?
jabez! what kind of talk is that for the sabbath? and me a-reading the holy word!
but you can handle it all right, huh? real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
a professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of africa ..
it's not my fault.  i didn't invite them.
you two have some sick sex thing?
some kind of mutation...?
sorry.
so suzie, you called us, remember?
either i'm going to tie you or mars will tie you.  which do you want?
balance, kelly.  bal-lance!
no, protecting her.
don.
what's that?
this seems a little sophisticated for them.  these are not subtle guys.
good.
how is he?
gail, please.
you have a lieutenant here...
i'll call you.
victor frankenstein, sir.  of geneva.
my...secret.
she did. but hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
richard burton was very good-looking.
i'm a girl.  i'm a girl.  i'm a girl -
when - when are you coming back?
what book is that?
it's like, every day i see a beautiful woman. i'm not used to that. i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, i don't know, once a week. i can't handle it.
i know.
july?!
it's a whozis?
well, not quite. see, those people down there: they aren't the ones i invited.
god, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what i <i>can't</i> do. in case you hadn't noticed, anton, i don't need rescuing.  but <i>you</i> did, once.
no!
then he will be when those iraqis get to him.  he was going to kill you.  he was one blink away from it.  he's dead, epps, and i'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
yes. i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
that wasn't a proposal -- i was just curious.
yes, i believe i do.
what's left of him. he'll never see outside of the star and garter.
ya know, i'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, i would love to get a bigger place.
i can just hear you now. "get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! you're too good for me!"
yeah, okay.  sure, norman.
oh!
no! arrgh!
who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
i can't say i'm convinced you're going anywhere.
oh... are you... ?
she drank liquid oxygen.
right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. everybody knows the story. the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. on pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
i don't know. i got a feeling.
just one--
oh, really.  general salazar was there?
uh-huh. why?
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
i'm confused about a lot of things right now. charlie's only one of them.
the names i've been called. but never svengali.  good luck.
you've <u>got</u> to say it!
let me tell you a few things about you dad, okay? he's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
i mean, i'm a deist.  a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin.  surely you knew that.
we have a situation. the members are assembling.
you will stay at her side?
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
did you hear what he sang?
just saying it's not hard to end a life.
not at all, sir.  i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
i'm no cat.  i'm just an assistant. a <u>secretary</u> --
we don't have a lord.
stop that.
yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. baad shit.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
all you've got is the here and the now trevor. that's all anyone really has. maybe this will make things easier to understand. a man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. in time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. and at the end of the day does it even matter? all these events you're describing. how can you be sure any of them really happened?
suspicious, after all these years?
do you know who wanda june is?
maybe we are...
why not?
well, how do i find out what kind of chromium is up in hinkley?
you told him you liked him.
the hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
..."down safely," crew perished in the crash....
hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
oh man, what the hell happened?
papa!
ok.
i believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. i don't know what the heck they do with 'em. maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
look ...
i see.  were you happy at school, harold?
are you watching a porno movie?
you better.
i suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. probably not too many men fit that bill.
i asked you to marry me. i'm ready for marriage. that's responsibility. that's growth.
the storms have done everything they can to me, i don't hate them. i don't even hear the wind. it blows beyond me. it was on such a night as this that barbara died.
what?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
alone. alone. i'm here alone.
why would i care where you're going.
of course it is howard. that's why they call it a marathon.
what did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to sherwood, ohio?
what's normal?
ohhh ... dear. not another word from the shock, yes it would be.
goodbye.
calling for emilio's macaw. i thought i heard him.
congratulations. you should spit in my face.
he did volunteer one time...
i've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
let's drop back an' boot up.
just askin'
this is a remarkable aircraft.
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she's nothing to you?  right out loud so i can hear?  tell her she's nothing, tell her she's nobody, just dirt?  will you do that?
what?!  what do you mean, i don't understand.
why not? after all, i got stuck with a railway ticket. i think i'm entitled to know.
nevamind 'look'...this punk bastard...i call him at work...i say 'johnny boy there?'...he doesn't even show up for work anymore...
what do you think?
no.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of hana on the island of maui...
okay.
yeah. a few things.
yes, boss.
sir?
i said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
yes!!
pop, do you want a shock? i think you're a great guy.
i know...
not anything built into the chassis.  if it hadn't come loose --
i'd rather be his whore than your wife.
you'll have to drive -- except down hill.
oh, but i am!
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
yeah, well, you're late.
ah-hah. and how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
but you better hurry.
26   continued:  
am i bothering you?
what are you afraid of, dad?  that i'll fall head over heels for joe -- well, i have -- as you did with mom.  that's always been standard, whether you like or not.
how are you, ellie?  are you happy?
you got a sane explanation for what he did?
how about i pick one out for you?
your mind is so slippery.
and i say she won't! i'll not have the scorn of god on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the sabbath!  and as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
stay calm!
fantastic!  wonderful!  but posters are very expensive.
see you in ten years.
no fucking.
what... what do you mean?
oh, i'd better hurry back.  i don't want to miss one minute of it.
no, sir.
yes.
i'm mary 2.
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
oh, ten dollars—
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
oh, yeah.  scared the hell out of skipper.
and how's life with the walking h-bomb?
how do you know i'm not?
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. you are staying. wendy, ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the sheraton. they do a magnificent job there. wendy is so excited you're coming.
you accusing me of extortion?
thanks.  but either way it still feels...
just take it in stride.
you wouldn't believe me.
you're positive of that, aren't you?
was it okay?
o deadly sin, o rude unthankfulness! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not. hence!
of course, sir.
okay.  but, what?
don't wear the beige one.
all right, then. it's your secret.
yes.  or forward into the future. i suppose i really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
i don't know how to fish, louise.
it sure is a beautiful old hotel.
can you use a few bucks? i ain't got much, but --
mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
and who might that be?
hey!  pipe tobacco!  i'm going to need all of this! this is swell!
i told you; don't push me around.
this is gonna work. if he sticks to the program. will he? stick to the program?
i'm joel.
y... yes. i guess i did.
yes, sir.
what if--
i never played fort sumter.
and may i go to mass?
i love this car. some cars sit, you know? this car, a car like this... grows. i mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
but then you've been so much better...
oh, you know the bay area!  always foggy!
i don't smoke.
how come?
it's not an "alley". i hate when people call it a "bowling alley", it's so common! i prefer "bowling center".
like that piece of ass he was with.
--i already get the post. i don't need another subscription.
there's already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer. every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you.
nothing so far.
longevity is classified.  no.
that's one thing i won't forget.  where's macaulay?  i ought to be starting.
well, don't you?
and boot-head.
it's that mrs. goodhall you have to be careful of, wilbur.
so i understand you correctly. if the missiles in cuba were dismantled, returned to the soviet union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba?
and yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
you know, i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to. the gaming commission would never give me a license. i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
hey, no.  leave those here.  if you really want her help.  i mean if you really do, leave them.  let her see them.  i'll see they're safe...
fine...maybe i'll come by later.
i killed him!  i killed him!
upstate where?
thank you
yeah, right.
don't pay to complain.
can we not talk about this?
oh my god.
josh, i need your help. doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. i thought maybe your father and the embassy might be able to do something.
yeah?
she's not my girlfriend, dude!
yes, please continue.
you lie.
well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
did you make the plate?!
joe it's not love. it's like. it's real strong like. and i got your information. now, get off my back!
i came through for you, mom and the butterflies, dad.
what's the riddle?
i received this information from an alien.  i was at the paramus holiday inn, i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what i'm saying? she wants me to know she ripped me off.
i'm okay. i just don't want to lis- ten.
hey, you guys back already?
i cannot betray my bride.
dad's home, already?
maybe it's true then. it's my voice on the tape.
what am i supposed to think?
don't mention it.
we're coming your way, man!
civil?  i'm civil.
this person and i are a thing of the total past. i promise you.
but mom, i can't find him!
that won't happen, billy.  mitch stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  the way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  i know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  that'll be the end of it.
"vicki."  ice-skater, or stewardess?
nobody said... norman...  what?  why are you looking at me like that?
tsch.
you know why, right?
like you couldn't believe.
and do they believe it?
great. now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side. but i misplaced it.
we were idealists.
huh?
i'm trying to tell you.  this is an enormous place.  eight master bedrooms.  a sunken tub in every bathroom.  there's a bowling alley in the cellar.  it's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. a very simple set-up: an older woman who is well-to-do.  a younger man who is not doing too well ... can you figure it out yourself?
shhhh. shhhh.
all right, that's enough.  look, we're all very impressed with andy's new toy --
i don't know what you're talking about. you're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. if you'll only tell me about it.
i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, dignan.
guenevere. and a beloved friend who will betray you.
we have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and if i have to open that closet you will get shot -- step out now.
you're giving them to me?
and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
i love you...
tell 'em your father gave it to you.
put a diaper on him, chin.  i want to talk to the great inspector lee.
no -- a pride to know that i can force you to my will. i'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, i've had to do much that i did not want to do. but so long as the great dr. macfarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am i a man -- and if i have not that, i have nothing. then i am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
don't do that, radar! you make me nervous.
i don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
my assistant quit today. okay? he was highly valuable to the project.
i may throw up.
it's a lovely garden.
there you go again, blaming yourself.  can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  you deserve better than simone.  i've got to go, dad.
sam, i'm going.
you do me too much honour, sire.
there's no call for violence. i've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. you use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. you see, you've been avoiding me, case.
ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
naturally.  i brought them myself.
gee, this is a surprise, mr. gittes.
do you mean to tell me you want to leave shangri-la?
and, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  it reminded me of you.
if you say so. here goes.
mary magdelen?
yeah, no kidding.
but mr. norman said --
sinatra had gl- you never said sinatra had glasses. so whatta you saying that i-i'm suffocating you?
no.  but they stand out, a little. like this.
get what?  are you accusing me of cheating?
is my credit good enough to buy you out?
is everything alright?
nah.
mm-hmm.
we're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
no, i'm just restoring it to its normal state.
i told you this was a sweet set-up.
mean?
arnie, help me.  doesn't anyone owe us money?
never mind, papa, it doesn't matter now.  she loved me once.  i want to die remembering that.
is that a threat, dr. bright?
she died.  her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  what is this about?
where are his pants?
stay out of this, matthew.  tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall.
i read you sir.
moneypenny... here i was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
the sensitive type.
she told you, didn't she?
i don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
hold still - hold still --
well, yeah i did, but i spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
i can't do that. five guys.
the patient was in great distress. naturally he was...yelling.
waiting for the bus that never comes...
do i hear a woman's voice?
right.
yeah, he's aces.  thanks, turk!
he doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
now i go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
that'll solve all our problems.
if you don't want to do it this way, i can remove it surgically.
half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
i'll take my chances.
dad, i don't know how to tell you this. and i was going to wait a while, but i think...dad,there was no bomb. a plane crashed into our backyard. i looked it up in old newspapers.
and, er... where are they now?
eh, poli sci?
so we got a plan?
where's ken? is he all right?
sssh. don't. don't, please.
the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?
why a beret?
swear to god.
for your own amusement?
wow, you can't buy this kind of publicity!
not yet.
and you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
there was a change in plans.
but, he's...
what are you afraid of?  i'm not going to hurt you!  what's the matter with you?
why not?
sure.
i did not call her mad.  i merely asked her if she was.  and i repeat the question.  are you mad?
hey wizard.
how low?
a bank?
nonsense, i'm your mother now and i want you to eat.
you must have been a baby.
practice enough this week, you prick?
ask anybody around here. as a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and i may go just like that --  -- i have promised my body to the columbia medical center.
something wrong?
you must be joking. i never eat breakfast,  did you sleep well?
what're you - a mindreader...?  who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
do you think i should?
are real?  how do you know you're not hearing things? how do you know i'm not someone in your head? somewhere, you know.
you didn't think to ask?
steer to one eight five. let's check her out.
mr rothstein.
thanks miriam.  say hi to henry and...
no, i really can't. i find it healthy never to characterize people i don't know or conversations i haven't heard. i don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. last time i saw ann she left here very... confused, i would say. and upset.
they tried and died....  jessica!
bring him in.
killaine...
you should have told me.
what are you talking about?  what do you think i'm doin'?  i'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  i'm keeping these people happy ... i'm keeping you happy ... i gotta keep the cops cooled out ... i gotta do everything ... i gotta pay for the pizza ... i'm workin' on it, do you know what i mean?  i'm workin' on it ... jesus christ!  i gotta do it all ... i got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  you want to take it over?
the angel... the angel of death. i'm scared, ned. ned, i'm gonna die.
yes, i do.  in fact, my firm has box seats for the mariners. why don't we all go next week?
come to the show with me. tonight i want you to see him with an audience.  they love him.
fifty minutes.
from what?
sure. thanks a lot about my mother. we'll work out some arrangement, because naturally i want to pay...
it won't be a problem.
why are ya goin' so early?
you bet you should have called.  you still live at home.  don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
control on.
just what i said. that's what i --
you're crazy.
you think i'm some sort of sap?! don't you?!
last one down springs for room service.
that is for the urn.
anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- i'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
we're not.
so that's it! "kestenbaum, kestenbaum." everybody was yelling "kestenbaum, kestenbaum." i thought it was some foreign language.
a couple of weeks back.
you're impressed with her, aren't you?
what's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. that's insane.
we ain't here to talk about that shit.
no.
monks bottle their own wine. don't they?
daddy -- stop it!
i forgot my glasses.
sorry.  are you dating anyone?
he was a merchant marine!  he was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
do you have a car, steph?
no, it's more like a leave of-  ha, ha, ha. yeah, they fired me.
yeah! boobs. heh heh. i just wanna say that again. boobs. heh heh.
norther, do you ever regret not making it to paris?
you know how rumors start.
i got fired.
guests.
hide? can't a fellow have a drink?
she likes to see you off in the morning.
george, you're acting very strangely.
nothing's going on.  maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  he's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
she was torn apart! she died of a broken heart.
oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
not a problem.
no. what is it?
what do you mean "you think so?"
too many. and you've got a new guest. a movie star from hollywood.
i ordered six already this morning! got a discount!
...i was one of a group of...
he only remembers i <u>found</u> him.  my point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing i could ever have done for you.
i'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
whereas avi's a zionist nazi.
i'm not...
yeah, wall, you know, i was just going there... to pick then up.
forty-five cigarettes. the price has gone up.
wait!  i'm a friend!
shh.  hide her car in the back!
oh, he's been crying! why have you been --
where were you?
it's spring break. i don't want to go to a will reading.
we each face death every day we're alive, saavik.
hi. hi sandy. i'm sorry to bother you, but i've got to talk to you.
urdu and hindi.
i don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
he was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... they shot him.
you jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. when it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
so you're a wire junkie.
a benedictine.
don't apologize, please.  i can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
you understand what you'll be doing?
what's he want of you?
yes, see, they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  but they can't move through solid rock. i think we should travel west to the mountains.
look out where you're aiming, will you?
this ain't the time, richard.
you betrayed us.
i am. you are.
if you were set up, i want to find out who did it.
are you going to help me up?
hey, mister, i don't know what's going on here. this don't make any sense.
not wrong, dumb ass, wong! you know, like the chinese name?
do what?
really?  well, come on, then.
we always help our friends, don't we?  it is no secret that the government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. there are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. the press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
...break away completely from--
i don't know.
di-diabetes? is that any excuse? diabetes?
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
how the fuck did he find me?
if it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
you just won't learn, will ya. hell, you come in here, i teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  you're just like all them new jerks. lotsa nerve and no brains.  and ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the big con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
as a tumor.
i don't like him chasing around after you...i don't trust him....
well, does it make sense to you?
why did you quit?
that ain't the way they're tellin' it. they're sayin' you done it fust.
brandon. clark brandon. fellow about my age. lot of money... that he didn't make. former american. now naturalized in canada. social standing indeterminate. manners not quite perfect. scotch superb.
under love's heavy burden do i sink.
i can't.
how? what could i say that would make a difference? i took away a year of your life--how do i apologize for that?
yeah, they are.
you guys got the latin homework?
why, you <u>whore</u>!
and...?
yes, i have. i will.
yeah, sure.  more so then than i am now.  that's life though, isn't it?
what happened...?
we're trying to get there. i hope we can.
the back door was open.
no.  it's not just how i felt toward jessica.  i've been cruel to even you.
if you are killed in the matrix, you die here?
god!  but there's nothing to say about god.
why not?
no!
liz'll give you a lift.  she knows where to go and everything... i don't have time to talk, rob.  i've got too much to do.
157  continued:
rambo.  nva coming.  pig dog kinh say meet them here.  whole garrison from con cuong is out.
no. you can be mine!
she lived on the plume.  you never know.
i'm a cook. do you understand 'cook?'
he . . .
and then you weren't there.
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
did you ever touch her?
did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. his offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th street, and he was using all these words i never heard before. he even offered me a job.
they're waiting to see my father.
your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  diane court is a showpony.  you need a stallion, my friend.  walk with us and you walk tall.
...who doesn't?
but there must be a reason. this is science, not art.
well, you never can tell...  i might get a pet. 
no, you the man.
is there someone inside you?
i know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, i'm sure.  i just... i need you, rob.  that's it.  and we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. reckon why they don't like me?
so what should i do with the pudding?
any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
she said michael.
there are two bodies found at this point.
it's a rare thing.  takes a turning point.
there's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
i can see it in your eyes.  you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in harry's stone cold heart.
i know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
okay, fireman.
first, you desert me, and now you mock me. go back to your one-eyed friend.
relax, roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
is he all right?
oohhhh, eugene!
yes, your holiness?
of course, i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here. you don't mind?
i had to arrange about the trip.
that's what they're doing.
shit...
i don't get you bruce wayne.
i said, skip it, michael. it's my treatment.
not interested. 
i'm fine.
you could've asked.
you have a boyfriend?  of course you do.
my name is lt. wydell, i'd like to ask you a few questions.
what do you think?
there ain't no thing here!! no thing!! there's you him and me!! got it! you him and...
why don't you come down to la? stay with us for a while.
i want an hour with him.
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish?
what was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
dwayne! i'm dwayne now! and you damn well better get used to it!
what do you mean?
sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
forget it.  i got vegetables coming out my ears.  usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately i ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
okay... have them get it out of the tank.
we were lovers.
wait. when are you going to tell them?
i know, i've seen him. sort of.
but -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
motherhood.
then where did it-- ? sir.  forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
the dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
the new star. what are you gonna name it?
no.
yeah.  you don't wanna know the details.
yeah... thank you.
i buy that. what about him?
do you have a moment, sir?
i don't want to see her later.  i want to hear her <u>now</u>.
spirits. anything over 45 proof burns well.
you're lookin' awful pretty.
and so you did your job, right?
we have enough for a shuffleboard team.  in heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  hitler plays shuffleboard.
wait a minute--i think i can cut something else out.  "back in four weeks." instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--that saves another word.
have they sat down?
skipper called us out of the rigging.
here's what i've got.  remember vladimir neski? russian politician? seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel. he never did. he was murdered.
good. in a few minutes, you'll meeting dr. brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. you're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
no. what is it? tell me.
we have a renew-your-subscription offer...
yes.
i still will, if you don't mind.
no, not me, i've been lucky.  but i've seen what happens to other people --
michael, anything.  what is it i can do for you?
well, i say lets tear this place apart for weapons. so when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
no!
of course you have not! i have not written it!
how ya doin' miss evans?
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
listen, man.  i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had.
have you seen his penis?
you know how i spent last weekend? walking his damned dog.
i didn't do anything wrong.
he'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. he always does.
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  that's all.
well, then, w-who was?
yes...
oh!  uh, i hope i didn't offend you.
well, no, but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something i want to do.  since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
oh, it's coming, it's coming.
shut-up...
i'd like yours too.
you love him?
then fuck it!!!
right again. you're no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.
after you, ma'am.
i'm a little short pops. i'll catch you next time.
krueger's the greater danger right now. we have to stop him.  _springwood_. that's where he'll go. that's where he's always gone.	but springwood's not like crystal lake. there's a couple hundred thousand people there. he could be anywhere.
started he couldn't remember things? got real violent? mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... but i don't know. seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
i sunk most of what i had into this condo, which devalued, and --
dear margo. you were an unforgettable peter pan - you must play it again, soon. you remember miss caswell?
just look!!
i was afraid you weren't gonna come. we haven't got much time.
what is that?
andy? andy is that you?
these old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  i'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
excuse me, sir.  i have an actual fact for you.
healy.
ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night. i guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
barometer's dropping.  the first blow'll come from the south.  might get interesting.
not editors. take my word for it. not editors!
i heard what you did. thank you.
defuse the bomb, please.
who says you're the good guys?
no, i don't want to.
nah, listen to it. it's a pussy. it'll just steam on us. it won't flash. go high in the ceiling.
you want me to contact starfleet?
believe in penny priddy?
but you took his orders.  he was directing the autopsy.
these two holes are yours...
no, you were middle class, like all americans.
who's the married man?
not the plates: the house. why is no one listening to me?? it's alive!  and once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
i wrote that.
from the store.
yes.
different door. not far from here.
yeah, but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here.
there's no motels around here.
what else?
oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. mine's just a little more personal.
yes sir.
according to this tag.
i know, poison needles in my shins. you've got 36 hours. peace, out.
well, er... it's slowing down.
i want to be near you!
but, keitel, if erik ever finds the horn resounding... if he ever crosses bi-frost, the rainbow bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
no.
they shouldn't have come without calling first.
one rule! no throwing up. he throws up, you forfeit everything.
why are you here?
but i got a train to make.
didn't i tell you to knock before you came in here?
that's terrific.
you have to come.
did you say, "i do"?
sure, gino, sure.
throw me out - because i'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, anne.
--hell, i don't think i'm ever leaving this place again--
you will or you won't.  don't look to me.  i'm going to sleep.
chosen me?
hello, adrian.
i hope you're right.  i'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
tomorrow?
get it.
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham. it has been destroyed. women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
value? ... value?
of course not! i'm a wanderer!  i'd like to go somewhere i've never been!
let's get out of here.
i don't either. i used to. but i'm through with that. y'know, if i don't love my body, then i'm just lost. you know? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  so, i've been seeing this guy...
hey, i'm a sacred vessel. all you've got in your belly is taco bell!
and just this year, "brian's sound spectrum". your own company even. big step.
i've seen worse.
liar.  she hates surprises.  what are you ordering?
harder.
you liar!
her.  it's an obvious move.  i'm building a case against her, remember?
i was thinking the poconos, charlie. maybe vegas.
why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
courage man, the hurt can not be much.
no, your grace! i mean with all humility, no. i would rather you dismissed me. it's obvious i don't satisfy.
where’s your wallet? have you got a wallet?
what is happening?  where's mason?
yes, the redoubtable paul.  he has the plantation, and i, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
and wear a crown and everything.
the same thing that could happen to any of us.
mmmm.
what's his name?
what an excellent day for an exorcism.
good morning, mr. dickson. my wife is much better this morning.
she don't look no worse to me.
go!
what for -- you wanna play hide the salami with his old lady?
i can explain.
now, that's crazy. it's fourteen floors!
of course not.
then disagree but don't stand in my way!
well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell. how are things going down at city hall?
shit, yeah.  i got numbers coming out of my ears.  like, for instance, ten.
i'm here to talk to you, sonny, not ...
...one more day.
i know -- teresa -—
we can go to one if you'd prefer.
well, this is hard for me, but i think it's important to be honest. don't you?
you'd prefer that? ... james...you don't really have a gun, do you.
yup.
coming, eileen...
very good. you follow directions well. now for the final part of the game. put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
as long as there's room for three in it.  what, didn't you bring your new friends?
with mrs. teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control -- 
listen, mister laplante... uh, bernie... who... are... you?
i promise we're gonna get away from him. the time has to be right, that's all. i'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. then he wouldn't want to hurt me. he wouldn't care then. we'll be fine. i promise. you go to bed now.  i love you.
sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
do not put this on ruiz's tab. start a new one.
your command is my wish, princess lili.
dad, you're not taking this seriously.
what are you doing? advertising martini?
travis, look, i dig it. let me explain. you choose a certain way of life. you live it. it becomes what you are. i've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. still don't own my own cab. i guess that's the way i want it.  you see, that must be what i am.
don't say much, do you?
back against the bars.  now.
pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
god damn it's him. i gotta go.
come on, daphne.
there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
oh, oh. sam wainwright! how are you? when did you get here?
library of congress.
until it withers away.
all right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--i looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the who's who!
captain, the enterprise!
we split the money?
sometimes a wound will kill.
standard vig.  minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
i'll ask the questions, helmuth.
what's that supposed to mean?
daddy, it's like i been tellin' ya --
tell you the truth, i don't give a shit for me. but that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
which one?
then how can it be chipped?
this is the end of the chase.
i can beat that.
you're not leaving. not until we go back for the others.
klute, the company's interest is tom grunemann. solely and exclusively. you say you can't find tom; all right, i'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
yeah.
sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
not yet.
unbelievable!  trent told me he wrote it.  he's history.
yes, i know. you want a lock to carry in your wallet?
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you're not you, they will kill you. don't you see? i know what you're doing, but it won't work!
and a car.
oh yeah?  oh yeah?  then where did i get this?
abby...
how much is that?
just five.  it's the economy... you think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
would that be miss sinclair?
you go down there.
it'll take time. this whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
i didn't say it bothered me.
what's going on, cynthia?
good, because i checked your salary -- and it bites.  how the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something i'll never ...
juicy, junior, real juicy.
sorry!
right.
you're never out, fergus.
captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
uh-huh...
is it a king or a queen?
i promised bonanno i'd destroy the tapes.
well!
would you please go and look?
i could get a search warrant.
do you hear me, sir!  if you ever fall... into british hands...  what white water?
yeah.
two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
we’re both thinking the same thing, right?
oh, god, michael, i know.  why does everything have to be so hard?
i told you, they hired me over the phone.  i never met anyone.
your family sent cards.  it was much appreciated.
of course not.  but -- how can i be efficient in the office if i don't get enough sleep at night?
really, loretta?
because it's wreckable. i took another look and i changed my mind.
don't call me ever again.
what's the matter with bjorn?
medicine. as in medicine man?
okay, then. clearly candied diller.
i think it's a different place for each person.
what?
dorothy?  well, what has dorothy done?
evening news?
it also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
she's counting on it.  she's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. or a carnival.
i called bucky's. i got her a cab. is there any hot mustard?
that's right i did, didn't i?
it's a little late, you son of a bitch.  there's a friggin' monster loose in here!  get the fbi, the fire department.  find metal cutters, cut through.  and bring a cannon.  the damn thing is huge.
that would be mrs de moraes mother, sir. mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter.
tell me, dr. watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
those sounds could be imitated.
i know what this is.    zed, you in?
tina wilcox.
all right, are we gonna have a problem?
iris is dead.  she was murdered.
no... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you.
then don't go to hollywood.
a place we have, that we know is protected.
...yes you heard me... don't ever call back here again.
the boy was here. he came in, sat down and we worked together.
my soul, woman.  i give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
it's the generator i think!  no power.
i don't fucking believe this. do you believe this?
i'll be your winger.
it was all they had.
i mean it. you watch old tapes of the ballgame, i'll fill you in... later. i mean it.
aye, sir.
it's saturday morning.  let's go shopping.
what about it?
tomorrow. we're late for lester.
you all been here a long time. doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
yeah?  yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
i won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
you're not going to kill us?
so. look at where we are: the year 2000! can you believe it? i mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
i want the girl.  unharmed.  now.
it has to be by the end of this week.
where am i?
five years. since it opened.
one other thing. do you have any tattoos?
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
it's because of the children she's got to go. i don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
and what's your excuse for being here?
not in a thousand years.
excuse me one second, would you, gabrielle?
takes one to know one! pig!
why?
real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to mr. whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. he was born with what he does best. eat. he's a swimming appetite. 'course he might eat this stuff, but then i've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  next time, ask me.
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
hey you!!!!  i'm gonna get you!!!  i'll get you!!!!
yes, he's a little bit... tilted. harmless, though.
all right. how much is pepsi here?
the dishes are juiced up, too.
how do those cockroaches get here so quick?
what?
...it looked money.
eat it.
do they?
a body.
human nature.  i'm majoring in behavioral science.
what's in the back?
i don't believe it! i can't believe it. she's lying.  you're lying. you're lying! every word you've been saying is a lie! come on, say it!
so who's he?
have you pulled yourself together?
sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. it makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
really.  i don't know.
yes. hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. he was cutting her. i shot him.
find something?
i'm sure. you've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
he's brought in the heavy mob.
you got to be under twenty-five -
aren't we all.
that creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
he's got it.
yeah.
just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
sure. just chisel some off your heart.
oh, yeah?
vivian, i want you to listen to me.  the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
that's him. how do you know 'em?
i came by the house every day after the funeral.  and then every week. then every other month.  then i stopped coming.  did you even notice?
naw. that's over with.
i gotta friend over there.  he was telling me things are kind of slow. so, i figured i'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  you know, give him something to do.
who...who kills me?
einstein, right?  we'll see ya.
everyone thinks brooks robinson is the greatest.
i work alone.  like you...  ...we always work alone.
everything... i don't have children.
oh, i dunno. watching tv.
and you know why? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. what's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
...if you are, then i'll take barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
from when? you left vegas with four- fifty?
i would have time for my own pleasures!
i'm finished.
michael...
third rail is dead.  get me up.  there must be a manual override in the booth.
there's nothing to forgive. it was all a dream.
whaddya mean you don't know? you either got a lot or you don't. what's not to know?
mr. wallace, i could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
toilets?
let's see.
oh, jesus -- nancy!  hey! we got a fire!
stay up here and finish your interview, i've got to see what the hell's going on down there before i can take responsibility for you to film there.
i won't be made to feel like i've done something wrong.
you didn't have to...
the emergency channel, open.
save me the sermon.  i've heard it all before, it's boring.
yeah, they suck.
yeah, sweetheart?
i got it..
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
that's it.
yeah, can you believe it?
as long as they can use you?
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where captain o'reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
i will, i promise.
aw, i do. but 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. it's the whites that need it real bad.
sounds funny to me.  as much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
don't tell me what to do! we're divorced -- i'm a free woman. you're not my husband and you're not my boss! and what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
well, i hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
yeah.
because...
then why did you marry her -
the sword of damocles is lifted from above seth's head. he's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. he knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
ilsa... you're alright?
calloway - i'm english, not irish.
when you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. it writes out all the answers on your brain.  now how about a slushee?
so i'm part-indian?
check out the other guy's buns.
we're through.  i mean it.  this is the end of the line, matsumoto.
good, you start tomorrow.
i don't know. wherever you want.
so what do you think?
yes...
i said.  get the gun.  out.  of my fucking <u>face.</u> before i wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
aren't your parents asleep?
i assure you that won't be necessary. we were only trying to help...
and where'd you go?
some faces you just don't forget. warren pike's is one of 'em.
yes, it is. now, i want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
come on in!
i'm just curious.  i can never tell what women think is handsome.  is he handsome?
-- i'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the united states government -- me -- i'm the one being ripped off!
perhaps he serves a different king.
what... what are you talking about?
sure he will.
i'm one of his people.  the cubans are his people.  and we're going to jail for him.
thank you so much.
if you want to go on, i can make it all right.
if someone has the horseman's skull... if they control the horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
perish the thought.
...yes. the day he got out of jail. i allowed him to make ten steps... no more. and bang. two hundred meters. by telescope. that night, i left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for tony.  ...i was 17. then, i never left the city...  and never had another girlfriend...
hey...hey!
everyone takes his turn.
more or less.
she left me. she's gone again.
you can't...
you can bring them with a word.
here we go again.
yes, sir. i had to go to the bathroom.
i'm a rapper.
you were in the car with bob?
who the fuck is momo? jesus, these fucking names...
no, but i can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
it is important to assure the succession.
i had to ask.  i apologize.
look, what are we doing here? are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
running this place for a fella in town. nothing much to speak of.
if you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. i'm glad he's dead.
it isn't a hype, shorty. and i meant what i said: join us.
good. for a second there i thought we were in trouble.
look, not having been there... i just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
but couldn't you...?
saw him do it?
this is agent james fujima.
now. we close now.
fuck you.
yeah.
they're for my cat. i use them to train him not to rip up paper.
he was my only brother...my only family!  i want blood for my blood.  we search...now.
don't deny it!
there's nothing to be afraid of. everything's going to be alright.
easy, cowboy. no vendettas on my ship. now: remember what i told you about nam? watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
i can.
abrams...
to our family.
you'll love it.  no base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
no.
but we have to match the other sketch.
yes.
how? we go to california. i got a cousin that's working for the los angeles gas company. that's how we get the address, see? isn't that clever? i take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'congratulations, miss grable. we have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and i'm here to present the award'.
it shouldn't be a long delay.
good luck.  you're going to use up all your help vouchers.
i do respect your mind! it turns me on! it makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! don't you see?
our other dinner guest.
what?
fletch, this is dumb.
couple of bucks.
how?
maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
why don't we just tow it in?
marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
i don't think you understand the full implications of --
was nice.
yeah, i know. back to the eiffel tower.  and what about you?
narcissus will never support you, caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
holy smoke! i forgot all about that.  send a wireless at once, "lovington detective agency. daughter escaped again. watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in miami. have your new york office keep tabs on king westley. intercept all messages. want her back at all costs!"
so you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  everybody likes me!
nothin' to do with it. i ain't never give john the kind of feelin' i give you, so i'm payin' him off now. don't feel you got to say anything. way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with john i just didn't.
yes, quite, but you should know that...
not all experiences are good, bianca. you can't always trust the people you want to.
yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
tell everybody hey.
why they glow like that?
i have some upstairs.
how come the f.b.i. don't put anya this together? they work- ed over "jennifer" for months?
i will, chief.  absolutely.
yes, no.
not at all.
yes, that's correct.
it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  we sometimes hang out there, you know....
let the record show i'm just standing here.
robert--
jor-el, be warned. this tone of yours approaches insolence.
i don't sleep much. you packed?
the alps.
it feels good to let it out, doesn't it? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
yeah.  with potential.
i think that's what i'm saying.
find it... and cross it!
didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
you get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "patel?"
the door's sealed from inside.  doc revna's in there, and it sounds like ackland's going nuts.
she needs to be alone, i think.
she snuck away.  and we haven't seen her.  she hasn't come home.
nossir.  i'd gone to tell the wid... to tell mrs. heine.
very interesting, even to a layman.
whataya mean, no record?
gloria -- i've waited for years.  i won't be put off!  i love you!  i want you!  can't you see that i'm at your feet?
i don't know. i guess so.
we haven't used big bertha since we relocated the generator module. that was four months ago.  i can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
once, about three or four months later. i felt so bad about stealing the camera, i hadn't even used it yet. i finally made up my mind to return it, but granny ethel wasn't there anymore. someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
all right, that's enough.  you're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. now lie back and we'll talk.
i'm staying here with you tonight. there's no getting rid of me.
if you mean...  she is a lieutenant in the army nursing corps, captain.
what's it mean?
i sure met some.
oh...
"i gotta go see about a girl"? what did they say?
i know that! but *where* they gone?
this is what this is about?  out building project in indonesia? contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
spanish.
not long -- now.
you got a light, honey?
no you're not –  you're glad, because now you've got a witness.  i heard the other police talking last night.  they don't seem to like you very much.
a serum test possibly.
can't.  got a passenger.
mary came with me.
louis, we were french!
of course, he'll love it. you're a terrific artist.
that's no problem. we have those in stock.
you remember the fellow this morning -- galbraith. you've got time before the supper show.
sorry.  i took a benzedrine.
sir, may i speak to you for a minute?
i don't know. but you and i already know that he has saved lives.
muriel rumsey.
what else? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
how have you dumped girls in the past?
no, son. we havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
<i>mr. bishop... this is claremont williams. i own the williams brothers armored car service.</i>
yeah.
passion.  of course.  find the photo of ivy after the flower ball.
nicely said, sir.
can't you listen to me? don't you want to get out of here?
yer crazy!--i ain't got no bracelet.
you filthy bastard. i should cave your fucking head in.
i was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
what?
the only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  i know i was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  you know, book-em-dano, call-for-backup, give-a-hoot-don't-pollute.
it's not what you think.
no! we not like to hear it! go to your room and shut up!
it's too late!  there they....
when was that?
[four-seven-four-seven.]
oh really. why's that?
you have a pimp?
why don't we step into any office? there's something i want your advice about, anyway.  i have my own office now, naturally. and you may be interested to know i'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
do what?
should i hit it?
here we go...
that's the plan.
sure - sure. don't you worry. i'll take care of you.
huh huh. you guys are funny. let's have a drink on it.
lisa, i won't be able to give you any --
dance, jack!  the night's but begun.
i'll kill you, harry -- so help me!
the dorms are only fifty feet away.  you could practically see into my window.  so, what difference does it make?
and johnnie is his son, that's johnnie marzzone?
very well then.
i don't <u>want</u> to be lady godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much i like chocolate.  i want to be a stud.
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to. and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. said it was him who told them 'bout me.
yeah.
very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
and that's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you'd thought you'd known.
i know.  me neither.
ten pounds.
maybe the feds got it.
wait... wait... just "brother". so i go in. "hello... hi... we loved your guest spot on baywatch... blah blah blah..." whatever. so, i start to read, and, mikey, i was money. i prepared for a week. it's a starring role. i'm crying... the casting director, she starts crying...
i gotta go take a piss.
hell, yes, they know each other. he bonded her out of county.
in this firm.
i don't know.  they've hurt the unicorn.
shut up, elliot.
well...
okay.  at least let me show my appreciation.  the secretary of labor is going to be indicted on wednesday. for the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
to go to the theater. wears i don't know what. make-up, padding.
suit yourself...i'm easy.  better watch out for the wockers.
i gotta get something to eat, i haven't eaten all day.
i'll come to the performance.
i'm not tired. i thought i might finish carolyn's skirt.
you found us okay?
why were you buying a coffin?
whatever it is you're upset about.
no just parry.
sure you do. this ward is air tight, i have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
whatever you two want. if you've got the time, i've got the wazoo.
is he nice?
she's right in the neighborhood. she's upset.
you're right.  maybe this'll save some time.
there is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. it may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
yes...
i'm sorry for the woman, fettes. but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  as for me, fettes, i let no man stop me when i know i'm right -- when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  and if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as i see it.
no thanks. i'm good.
yes, i will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
couple hundred on his person. those hombres would've taken the stash.
no.
do you know him?
it was no time to lose my partner. we're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
i deny his every charge.
they - they don't know me. you do. they won't take me unless you go. look at me. i need this.
...but what'd she do?
kramer...
sure.  every bunco man in the country knows gondorff.
what is wrong with you?
right first time.
yes.  it's not a very good name, is it?  but we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
i been told to take your car in, sir.
i got half.
those two musicians from the garage!
everything, but everything.
shit.  shit, shit, shit!
what, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
and that's what i say, too. we could have all been killed.
wait a minute...! we don't know what we're talking about here...
it's probably trivial.
i'm a field agent.
would you like to have me turn around for you, bingy?
which you have in mind.
i gotta go.
boy? you here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
maybe. i think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
does anybody?
it shall not happen again, monsieur.
"go ask his name--if he be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed."
i am felix benvenuto von gaigern. my mother called me flix.
i knew you walked this way to work.  i wanted to find you before they did.
walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for?
it looks delicious.
if you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
what's that?
i really don’t like that comparison, honey.
but tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
he'll have you -- and tom.
smoke the rest of that joint, james, and you can start on the box.
this could be it.
what are you going to do?
juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. there were never witnesses.
me, too.
yes, of course, i'm so sorry. stupid of me. hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
i bet.
why did you agree to come here?
so i don't shop.
sure. it sounded like a number one tune all right.
i've all ready gone six hundred miles... i can't do it again.
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door, i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
you can be a thief and have a conscience.
gotta go.
now you're a professional!
come in, dave.  have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  coffee?
that's right. have you anything to suggest?
you gotta get out of here.
three years, john.  is that not a bit long to be grieving?
baltus van tassel.
i did...
london.  that's a promotion!
you afraid we're gonna steal it?
no, but, no, not at all.  i'm sorry. you came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  that's all.
i said i would...
positive. the soviet union collapsed without a shot being fired. the cold war is over.
yes, sir.
sure i'm sure. and just what are you implying? i'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. what's maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? you're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. not by a longshot.
just trying to be helpful.
it would bring us together.
okay... they want you out. it's against the law to fire you for having aids, so they make you look like a fuck up. which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
paulie, you've got kids, right?
we want ... a shrubbery!
terminated.
i really don't know.
captain.  i'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
say, shep, how ya doin' there?
no, i'm just not that hungry.
never better.
come on. haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
i <u>told</u> you.
oh, charlie again.
why?
in a second!
what's the matter?
the same, your majesty.
i am a scientist you asshole! this could be the most important discovery in 400 years. do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
we have to do something.
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald...
i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. you said, "so go" with such disdain.
pressure?  dela, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. sheeett!!!  this is lightstuff. now when you scramblin' out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
sure...
sure!  so i guess that means i'm an artist after all.
or course. you should come over to the house. the boys would love to meet you.
you are going to drive to the frontier.
i need the job.
what?
"one day, fanchon was visited by a surgeon. he ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
it's worth the effort. believe me. besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
harlan.
i promise you in time, she'll become your home ...if i could offer you one piece of advice?
you will? for sure?
mmmm... you give good compliment. clean up and come back to bed.
that's right.
thanks.  you think this whole business is silly, don't you? i mean running away and everything.
how would you kill him?
barbara.
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. want to know what it's really like? it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. glamorous, huh?  and the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
sir, the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television.  you can't afford to leave that hanging.
where?
you can trust me.
i care about you, a - but i just don't have those kind of feelings for you. i'm sorry. i'm not in love with you.
cause i thought glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. so i locked him in his room!  sorry. anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
yes. no.
